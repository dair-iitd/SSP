" O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O

required O

if O

that O

needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU B-ORG
Farm O

to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

from O
the O

was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O

France B-LOC
that O
under O

his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O

, O
questioned O
if O
such O

I O
was O
right O
here O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
standing O
at O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
received O
the O
ball O
for O
the O
kick O
. O

The O
maul O
was O
there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
hold O
off O
because O
we O
had O
the O
ball O
. O

When O
( O

Justin B-PER

the O

he O
was O
going O
to O
go O
on O
the O

where O
Jon B-PER

so O
I O
emptied O
my O
lung O
at O
him O
to O
get O
the O
ball O
this O
way O
. O

I O
just O
hit O
through O
and O
I O
was O
punching O
the O
air O
before O
the O
ball O
got O
there O

It O
cost O
me O
a O
few O
bucks O
at O

The O
decision O
to O
attempt O
a O

was O
a O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
Brooke B-PER

It O
was O
just O

last O

to O
paint O
the O

out O
any O
of O

violations O
of O

rights O
which O
Tutu B-PER
is O
investigating O
. O

Human O
rights O
lawyer O
Brian B-PER
Currin I-PER
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O
all O
. O
" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O
hit-squad O
leader O
Dirk B-PER
Coetzee I-PER
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu B-PER

deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine I-PER
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B-PER
Botha I-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee B-PER
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O
media O
interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin B-PER
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O
truth O
commission O

Last O

National B-ORG

the O

Freedom B-ORG

of O
General O

Viljoen I-PER
left O
many O
South O

unsatisfied O
. O

Boraine B-PER
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O
submission O
, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O
radio O
talk O
show O
declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

What O
the O
people O
expect O
is O
to O
have O
houses O
, O
to O
have O
jobs O
. O
" O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B-PER
Gagiano I-PER
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National B-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O
1990 O
, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O
. O

One O
has O
to O
feel O
a O
bit O
guilty O

feel O
the O
need O
for O
reconciling O
yourself O

a O
historical O

stayed O
after O
sweating O
out O
a O
four-set O
win O
on O
Monday O
over O
qualifier O
Tommy B-PER
Haas I-PER
. O

" O
I O
still O
feel O
it O
's O
embarrassing O
what O
happened O
and O
I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O
, O
' O
That O
's O
it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

" O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
play O
, O
especially O
spectators O
and O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
out O
here O
and O
want O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
tennis O
, O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O
" O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O
accordance O
with O
ATP B-ORG
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O
account O
other O
factors O
that O
raised O
objections O
of O
favourtism O
toward O
U.S. B-LOC
players O
. O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open O
was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny B-PER
Kafelnikov I-PER
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia B-LOC
. O

Kafelnikov B-PER
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O
's O
tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

At O
a O
news O
conference O
attended O
by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O
Sunday O
, O
U.S. B-LOC
Davis O
Cup O
player O
Todd B-PER
Martin I-PER
expressed O
the O
players O
' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin B-PER
said O
. O

Stich B-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand O
Slam O
. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O
step O
with O
his O
6-3 O
1-6 O
6-1 O
7-5 O
win O
over O
compatriot O
Haas B-PER
on O
a O
sun-baked O
Grandstand O
court O
. O

Others O
advancing O
early O
on O
Monday O
included O
11th-seeded O
American O
Malivai B-PER
Washington I-PER

the O

Magnus B-PER
Gustafsson I-PER
, O
and O
two-time O
former O
French O
Open O
champion O
Sergi B-PER
Bruguera I-PER
of O
Spain B-LOC
, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich B-PER
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B-PER
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. O
Open O
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open O
final O
to O
Andre B-PER
Agassi I-PER
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American O
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B-PER
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER
withdrew O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich B-PER
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain B-LOC
's O
Felix B-PER
Mantilla I-PER
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O
in O
the O
Open O
and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich B-PER
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O

undisclosed O
proposals O
on O
Chechnya B-LOC

political O
future O
have O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O
rounds O
of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin B-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

Lebed B-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed B-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian O
forces O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation I-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow B-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus I-LOC
. O

Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O

The O
Securities B-ORG

Commission I-ORG
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq O
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC B-ORG
Chairman O
Arthur B-PER
Levitt I-PER
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O

division O
of O

, O
Richard B-PER
Lindsey I-PER
, O
said O

firms O
will O
probably O
need O

spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B-ORG
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O

the O

$ O
100 O

over O
five O

to O
upgrade O
its O

. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O

with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O

orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O

" O

" O
ask O

from O

makers O
who O
trade O
more O

during O
any O
quarter O
on O

. O

The O
SEC B-ORG

will O
mean O
a O

Andrei B-PER
Medvedev I-PER
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O

on O

for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O

" O

" O
Medvedev B-PER

in O
the O

It O
was O
Medvedev B-PER

sixth O
victory O
in O
a O

after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet O
Cup O
. O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O

I O
was O
doing O

they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O

me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O

such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O

" O

the O
last O
two O

" O

" O
he O
said O

Just O
three O
years O

Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O

, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O

and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER

ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O

he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O

two O

" O
It O

somewhere O
where O
I O
would O

" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O

" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O

that O
I O
have O
to O

" O

As O

Medvedev B-PER
hired O

While O

the O
fact O
that O

The O

said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain B-LOC

mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU B-ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely I-PER
told O
Reuters B-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain B-LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU B-ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE O
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely B-PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O

of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O

. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE O
before O
2001 O
. O

British O

' O

called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O

will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O

Naish B-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O

carry O
out O
a O

of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European O
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O

this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B-PER

The O
report O
could O
well O

In O
an O
interview O
following O
its O
first-half O
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O

it O
had O

Hope I-PER
said O
T&N B-ORG
had O
taken O
defensive O
action O
to O
protect O

Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
's O
been O
in O
the O
first O
half O

" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O
market O
( O
trend O
) O
this O
year O

It O
could O
be O
better O

or O
it O
could O
be O
worse O

" O
Hope B-PER

echoing O
the O

" O
You O

" O
he O
said O

Compared O
with O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
, O
when O
T&N B-ORG
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 O
, O
Hope B-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope B-PER
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African O
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O
-- O
we O
're O
rather O
used O

it O

And O
we O
feel O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
all O
the O
right O
things O

" O
Hope B-PER
said O
. O

" O
When O
the O
( O

figures O
will O
bounce O
back O
up O

just O
a O
function O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O

emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
this O

as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O

forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O

since O
Rubin B-PER

tour O

force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O

Speculation O
that O

grew O
after O

sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O

Should O

worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O

Rubin B-PER

predecessor O
at O
the O

Lloyd B-PER

, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O

" O

under O

we O

" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER

the O

has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O

" O

That O
strategy O

backed O
up O

instances O

widely O

the O
architect O
of O

using O

" O
Rubin B-PER

come O
in O

" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B-ORG

might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era O
policy O
could O
spell O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness B-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan I-PER

reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O

were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
" O
said O
Widness B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B-LOC
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O

" O
If O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
