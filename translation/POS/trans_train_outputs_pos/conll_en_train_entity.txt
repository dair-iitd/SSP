DPA
:
Iraqi
authorities
announced
that
they
had
busted
up
3
terrorist
cells
operating
in
Baghdad
.
Two
of
them
were
being
run
by
2
officials
of
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
!
The
MoI
in
Iraq
is
equivalent
to
the
US
FBI
,
so
this
would
be
like
having
J.
Edgar
Hoover
unwittingly
employ
at
a
high
level
members
of
the
Weathermen
bombers
back
in
the
1960s
.
The
third
was
being
run
by
the
head
of
an
investment
firm
.
You
wonder
if
he
was
manipulating
the
market
with
his
bombing
targets
.
The
cells
were
operating
in
the
Ghazaliyah
and
al
-
Jihad
districts
of
the
capital
.
Although
the
announcement
was
probably
made
to
show
progress
in
identifying
and
breaking
up
terror
cells
,
I
do
n't
find
the
news
that
the
Baathists
continue
to
penetrate
the
Iraqi
government
very
hopeful
.
It
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
ARVN
officers
who
were
secretly
working
for
the
other
side
in
Vietnam
.

Guerrillas
killed
a
member
of
the
Kurdistan
Democratic
Party
after
kidnapping
him
in
Mosul
.
The
police
commander
of
Ninevah
Province
announced
that
bombings
had
declined
80
percent
in
Mosul
,
whereas
there
had
been
a
big
jump
in
the
number
of
kidnappings
.
On
Wednesday
guerrillas
had
kidnapped
a
cosmetic
surgeon
and
his
wife
while
they
were
on
their
way
home
.
In
Suwayrah
,
Kut
Province
,
two
car
bombs
were
discovered
before
they
could
be
detonated
.
(
Kut
is
in
southeastern
Iraq
and
has
an
overwhelmingly
Shiite
population
,
who
are
on
the
lookout
for
Baathist
saboteurs
and
willingly
turn
them
in
.
This
willingness
is
the
main
difference
in
the
number
of
bombings
in
the
south
as
opposed
to
the
center
-
north
of
the
country
.

In
Baghdad
Kadhim
Talal
Husain
,
assistant
dean
at
the
School
of
Education
at
Mustansiriyah
University
,
was
assassinated
with
his
driver
in
the
Salikh
district
.
Guerrillas
killed
an
engineer
,
Asi
Ali
,
from
Tikrit
.
They
also
killed
Shaikh
Hamid
'Akkab
,
a
clan
elder
of
a
branch
of
the
Dulaim
tribe
in
Tikrit
.
His
mother
was
also
killed
in
the
attack
.
Two
other
Dulaim
leaders
have
been
killed
in
the
past
week
and
a
half
.
Guerrillas
near
Hawijah
launched
an
attack
that
left
6
dead
,
including
4
Iraqi
soldiers
.
One
of
them
was
from
the
Jubur
tribe
and
was
deputy
commander
of
the
Hawijah
garrison
.
Two
hundred
members
of
the
Batawi
clan
of
the
Dulaim
demonstrated
in
Baghdad
on
Friday
,
protesting
the
killing
of
their
clan
elder
,
Shaikh
Kadhim
Sarhid
and
4
of
his
sons
,
by
gunmen
wearing
Iraqi
army
uniforms
.
(
This
is
a
largely
Sunni
Arab
clan
,
and
some
Sunni
observers
have
accused
Shiite
elements
in
the
government
of
being
behind
the
assassination
;
it
is
more
likely
the
work
of
Sunni
Arab
guerrillas
punishing
the
Batawi
leaders
for
cooperating
with
the
Dec.
15
elections
.
)
Al
-
Zaman
:
The
Iraqi
High
Electoral
Commission
on
Friday
denied
a
request
of
the
Debaathification
Commission
to
exclude
51
individuals
from
running
on
party
lists
in
the
Dec.
15
elections
on
grounds
of
having
been
sufficiently
involved
in
Baath
activities
to
warrant
their
being
excluded
from
civil
office
.
The
Commission
said
it
had
no
legal
grounds
for
such
an
exclusion
.
This
item
is
a
small
one
and
easily
missed
.
But
in
my
view
it
is
highly
significant
.
The
Debaathification
Commission
had
been
pushed
by
Ahmad
Chalabi
and
his
Iraqi
National
Congress
very
hard
,
and
had
pushed
many
Sunni
Arabs
into
the
arms
of
the
guerrillas
.
Chalabi
has
been
increasingly
marginalized
within
Iraq
,
however
,
despite
his
ties
of
clientelage
with
Washington
and
Tehran
.
He
is
no
longer
in
the
dominant
Shiite
list
,
the
United
Iraqi
Alliance
,
and
wo
n't
have
many
seats
in
the
new
parliament
.
Some
2,000
junior
officers
of
the
old
Baath
army
have
been
recalled
to
duty
in
recent
months
,
something
Chalabi
would
have
blocked
if
he
could
have
.
Now
the
Electoral
Commission
is
refusing
to
punish
people
for
mere
past
Baath
Party
membership
.
The
situation
in
Iraq
is
only
going
to
get
better
this
way
.
If
someone
committed
a
crime
against
humanity
,
prosecute
the
person
.
If
he
or
she
did
not
,
then
they
should
have
all
the
same
rights
as
other
Iraqis
.
Al
-
Sharq
al
-
Awsat
reports
that
a
key
eyewitness
in
the
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
for
a
1982
massacre
at
Dujail
has
died
.
A
team
from
the
court
managed
to
take
his
deposition
before
he
died
.
The
trial
begins
again
Nov.
28
.
In
Baghdad
the
fighting
still
continues
in
several
areas
,
mostly
in
Sadr
city
and
Adhamiya
.
Baghdadis
do
n't
venture
much
out
of
their
neighbourhoods
any
more
,
you
never
know
where
you
might
get
stuck
.
There
has
been
talk
that
the
night
curfew
might
be
implemented
again
.
My
neighbourhood
has
been
surrounded
by
American
troops
for
three
days
now
,
helicopters
have
been
circling
over
our
heads
non-stop
.
Fedayeen
are
now
visible
on
the
street
and
they
have
become
bolder
than
ever
.
Yesterday
there
were
tens
of
them
putting
road
blocks
on
our
street
and
setting
up
mortars
,
they
only
come
out
in
the
open
when
Americans
leave
the
area
,
then
they
start
firing
mortars
indiscriminately
and
shooting
their
AK
-
47's
in
the
air
.
They
are
setting
the
road
blocks
at
the
exact
same
positions
they
were
during
the
war
last
year
,
which
indicates
they
are
the
same
people
.
And
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
really
,
people
who
are
suggesting
that
we
go
out
and
fight
them
are
living
in
dream
land
.
Even
the
IP
and
ICDC
have
abandoned
the
neighbourhood
,
and
those
are
trained
and
armed
,
so
do
n't
expect
scared
civilians
to
do
anything
except
to
hide
inside
and
pray
a
helicopter
or
a
tank
does
n't
bomb
them
,
and
also
how
are
American
soldiers
going
to
distinguish
the
brave
and
valiant
civilians
from
the
Fedayeen
?
Everyone
is
apprehensive
,
there
is
some
talk
that
April
9th
and
10th
are
going
to
be
bloody
days
.
Most
people
have
n't
gone
to
work
the
last
few
days
,
although
it
seems
that
the
rest
of
Baghdad
is
'
normal
'
(
if
you
can
define
what
normal
is
)
.
There
are
rumours
about
preparations
by
slum
dwellers
for
another
looting
spree
against
banks
,
governmental
and
public
property
similar
to
the
one
that
took
place
last
April
,
and
I
have
already
overheard
youngsters
in
my
neighbourhood
joking
about
it
and
saying
things
like
"
This
time
we
will
be
the
first
to
loot
,
we
did
n't
get
anything
the
last
time
"
.
Mosques
are
calling
for
donating
blood
,
food
,
and
medicine
for
Fallujah
,
and
several
convoys
have
already
headed
out
for
Fallujah
,
most
of
them
returned
later
though
.
What
irritates
me
is
this
sudden
false
'
solidarity
'
between
Sunni
and
Shi'ite
clerics
,
we
all
know
that
they
would
be
glad
to
get
at
each
other
s
throats
when
they
have
the
chance
,
and
Shia
clerics
were
describing
Fallujan
insurgents
as
'
Ba'athists
'
,
'
Saddamites
'
,
'
Wahhabis
'
,
and
'
terrorists
'
just
a
few
days
ago
.
So
what
happened
?
I
guess
it
's
just
the
old
new
Arab
'
Me
against
my
brother
,
me
and
my
brother
against
my
cousin
,
me
and
my
cousin
against
my
enemy
'
,
or
'
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend
'
thing
going
on
again
.
Speaking
of
Fallujah
,
we
have
only
Al
-
Jazeera
to
rely
on
for
our
news
from
there
.
They
have
sent
over
their
top
reporter
Ahmed
Mansour
to
the
town
,
and
he
is
spouting
all
kinds
of
propaganda
hourly
reminding
me
of
Al
-
Sahhaf
.
They
are
targetting
ambulances
,
"
American
snipers
are
shooting
children
and
pregnant
women
"
,
and
"
They
are
using
cluster
bombs
against
civilians
"
is
all
you
get
to
hear
from
him
.
He
did
once
make
an
unforgivable
error
when
he
mentioned
that
Fallujan
militants
were
shooting
at
the
Marines
from
the
roofs
of
mosques
and
houses
in
Hay
Al
-
Golan
,
but
of
course
that
is
okay
for
Al
-
Jazeera
.
Someone
who
called
himself
Abu
Hafs
from
the
Ibn
Al
-
Khattab
Brigades
(
another
new
group
)
was
on
Al
-
Jazeera
describing
the
enormous
casualties
among
the
Marines
and
he
sweared
that
American
soldiers
were
mutilating
the
bodies
of
dead
insurgents
.
Over
300
Iraqis
are
reported
dead
and
500
wounded
in
Fallujah
alone
.
Al
-
Iraqiyah
tv
said
that
ICDC
were
controlling
Ramadi
.
Azzaman
newspaper
mentioned
an
announcement
signed
by
Abdul
Aziz
bin
Muqrin
,
an
Al
-
Qaeda
operative
in
Saudi
Arabia
on
an
Islamic
website
'
the
voice
of
Jihad
'
,
in
which
he
stated
that
"
although
mutilating
dead
bodies
is
not
originally
permitted
in
Islam
,
but
in
this
case
it
is
allowed
if
Muslims
use
it
against
infidels
to
deter
them
from
committing
criminal
actions
"
.
He
added
that
"
America
does
not
understand
anything
except
the
language
of
force
and
retaliation
,
they
were
kicked
out
of
Somalia
in
humiliation
after
that
soldier
was
dragged
in
Mogadishu
for
the
whole
world
to
see
"
,
and
that
"
the
day
will
come
when
the
dead
bodies
of
Americans
and
Jews
would
be
dragged
,
defiled
,
and
stepped
on
in
the
Arabian
peninsula
together
with
their
agents
and
supporters
"

Elena
's
motorcycle
tour
through
the
region
around
Chernobyl
has
revived
interest
in
one
of
the
most
serious
nuclear
disasters
in
history
.
We
all
know
what
happened
,
but
even
to
this
day
,
there
are
many
different
versions
and
opinions
on
how
it
happened
and
what
effect
Chernobyl
will
have
on
the
health
of
people
affected
by
the
fallout
.
UPDATE
:
Now
you
can
tour
Chernobyl
and
write
your
own
story
.
This
is
not
a
post
about
fault
-
finding
or
assigning
blame
.
It
is
a
time
to
learn
what
happened
and
how
it
may
affect
the
future
.
There
was
a
soothing
authoritative
UNSCEAR
(
United
Nations
Scientific
Committee
on
the
Effects
of
Atomic
Radiation
)
report
in
2000
on
the
health
effects
of
Chernobyl
confirming
that
there
was
no
scientific
evidence
of
any
significant
radiation
-
related
health
effects
to
most
people
exposed
.
This
was
heavily
promoted
by
the
Australasian
Radiation
Protection
Society
in
a
press
release
titled
THE
MYTHS
OF
CHERNOBYL
which
contained
the
following
:
One
of
the
most
widespread
myths
of
recent
times
is
that
the
Chernobyl
nuclear
reactor
accident
in
1986
caused
many
thousands
of
extra
cancer
deaths
in
neighbouring
regions
,
and
that
public
health
has
been
severely
affected
by
exposure
to
radiation
.
Many
people
still
believe
that
to
be
true
,
even
though
the
Ministry
of
Russian
Federation
on
Civil
Defence
,
Emergencies
and
Elimination
of
Conseguences
of
Natural
Disasters
(
EMERCOM
of
Russia
)
reported
this
in
1996
:
CHERNOBYL
ACCIDENT
:
TEN
YEARS
ON
In
the
last
decade
,
there
has
been
a
real
and
significant
increase
in
childhood
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
adult
carcinoma
of
the
thyroid
in
contaminated
regions
of
the
former
Soviet
Union
(
Wi940
)
which
should
be
attributed
to
the
Chernobyl
accident
until
proven
otherwise
.
The
prestigious
IAEA
(
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
)
published
an
early
report
on
Chernobyl
which
was
based
on
information
from
Russian
sources
and
stated
that
there
was
no
significant
health
effects
.
However
,
in
April
2001
,
the
IAEA
published
Fifteen
Years
after
the
Chernobyl
Accident
-
Lessons
learned
.
which
contradict
the
earlier
reports
.
Here
are
some
excerpts
:
The
dramatic
increase
in
radiation
-
induced
thyroid
cancers
in
children
and
adolescents
in
Belarus
,
Russia
,
and
Ukraine
,
which
have
been
observed
since
1991
,
continues
to
this
day
.
...
a
drop
in
the
birth
rate
,
a
deterioration
in
women
's
reproductive
health
,
an
increase
in
complications
during
pregnancy
and
birth
,
and
a
deterioration
in
neonatal
health
....
The
dynamics
of
change
in
the
state
of
health
of
children
affected
by
the
Chernobyl
accident
in
all
three
countries
-
Belarus
,
Russia
,
and
Ukraine
-
in
the
post-accident
period
is
characterized
by
persistent
negative
tendencies
:
the
morbidity
rate
is
going
up
,
the
number
of
really
healthy
children
is
dropping
,
and
disability
is
increasing
.
As
a
parent
,
I
can
well
imagine
how
painful
it
must
be
for
those
families
whose
children
are
succumbing
to
radiation
poisoning
.
There
is
a
lot
to
learn
about
Chernobyl
.
Being
well
-
informed
will
give
you
certainty
and
that
is
desirable
in
a
world
of
conflicting
reports
.
There
are
a
wealth
of
references
on
Chernobyl
.

of
the

radiation
:
As
a
child
in
the
50's
I
had
a
lot
of
glandular
problems
and
they
treated
it
with
radiation
therapy
(
primitive
at
best
!
)
and
stopped
when
a
lesion
on
my
neck
started
enlarging
--
they
said
it
was
not
CA
but
stopped
the
treatments
....
Remember
the
old
shoe
sizing
machines
that
was
a
form
of
radiation
xray
?
That
too
was
stopped
.
Do
n't
have
to
mention
what
radiation
has
done
and
is
still
doing
to
Hirsohima
&
Nagaski
folks
--
there
can
be
no

The
Chernobyl
Children
's
Project
(
http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp
)
offers
several
ways
to
help
the
children
of

.
One
of
them
is
the
Rest
and
Recuperation
Program
,
wherein
a

for
a
few

summer
.
Even
a
little
time
spent
receiving
wholesome
,
uncontaminated
food
,
good
medical
care
,
etc.
can
add
years
to
their
lives
.
S.
and
I
have
an
acquaintance
who
has
hosted
several
of
these
children
for
many
years
;
to
see
these
little
ones
breaks
the
heart
.
The
urge
to
protect
and
gather
them
all
in
is
almost
overwhelming
,
and
makes
me
more
grateful
for
the
blessings
I
have
.
Take
care
,
my
friend
,
Linda
I
'm
sorry
to
say
Elena
's
story
has
been
revealed
to
be
a
fake
.
What
do
the
new
al
-
Qaeda
videotape
and
audio
speeches
of
Bin
Laden
and
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
tell
us
about
the
hopes
of
the
remaining
top
leadership
of
the
organization
?
Because
the
US
and
Pakistan
have
managed
to
capture
or
kill
about
2
/
3s
of
the
top
25
al
-
Qaeda
commanders
,
the
middle
managers
are
not
in
close
contact
with
al
-
Zawahiri
and
Bin
Laden
.
The
tape
was
a
way
to
signal
priorities
.
These
are
1
)
Assassinate
or
overthrow
Gen.
Pervez
Musharraf
,
the
Pakistani
military
"
president
"
who
had
made
a
coup
in
1999
and
has
thrown
in
his
lot
with
the
United
States
against
the
Taliban
and
al
-
Qaeda
.
Musharraf
has
been
trying
to
purge
his
officer
corps
of
the
substantial
number
of
al
-
Qaeda
sympathizers
.
His
military
intelligence
has
captured
major
figures
like
Abu
Zubayda
and
Khalid
Shaykh
Muhammad
,
as
well
as
nearly
500
other
al
-
Qaeda
operatives
,
over
400
of
whom
the
Pakistanis
have
turned
over
to
the
US
.
Musharraf
held
elections
in
October
of
2002
,
in
which
center
-
right
parties
did
well
,
but
in
which
nearly
20
percent
of
parliament
seats
went
to
the
fundamentalist
religious
party
coalition
,
MMA
.
MMA
also
captured
the
Northwest
Frontier
Province
,
which
probably
shelters
Bin
Laden
and
al
-
Zawahiri
,
and
is
in
a
joint
government
of
Baluchistan
Province
,
also
on
the
Afghanistan
border
.
If
al
-
Qaeda
can
kill
Musharraf
or
instigate
a
military
coup
against
him
by
Islamist
junior
officers
,
they
can
hope
to
catapult
the
MMA
to
power
as
political
allies
and
hosts
.
They
would
thereby
gain
control
of
a
major
base
for
terrorist
operations
,
which
is
also
a
nuclear
power
.
All
this
is
highly
unlikely
,
as
with
most
al
-
Qaeda
crackpot
schemes
.
But
so
was
it
unlikely
that
a
small
group
of
Arab
mujahidin
would
virtually
take
over
Afghanistan
.
Response
:
The
US
must
do
whatever
it
can
to
strengthen
the
legitimacy
of
the
Pakistani
government
.
On
the
one
hand
,
it
should
pressure
Musharraf
to
take
off
his
uniform
and
run
for
president
in
a
fair
election
,
and
to
repeal
the
contentious
"
Legal
Framework
Order
"
that
essentially
perpetuates
his
dictatorship
.
On
the
other
,
restrictions
should
be
lifted
on
the
mainstream
Muslim
League
-
N
and
Pakistan
People
's
Party
,
who
can
defeat
the
MMA
in
fair
elections
if
not
hogtied
by
the
secret
police
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
US
should
strong
-
arm
India
and
Pakistan
into
a
final
settlement
of
the
Kashmir
issue
.
Al
-
Zawahiri
attempted
to
use
Musharraf
's
lack
of
progress
in
helping
the
Muslims
of
that
Indian
state
as
a
justification
for
his
overthrow
.
The
Kashmir
issue
generates
far
more
terrorism
,
and
even
the
threat
of
nuclear
war
,
than
Iraq
ever
did
.
2
)
Target
Israel
and
encourage
the
worst
elements
of
the
Palestinians
by
playing
on
the
iron
fist
policies
of
the
Sharon
government
.
Response
:
The
US
has
succeeded
in
politically
isolating
Hamas
,
and
started
the
process
of
cutting
off
its
funding
.
This
terrorist
organization
can
now
only
pull
off
far
less
sophisticated
bombings
and
attacks
.
It
should
continue
to
be
defanged
.
But
Sharon
's
iron
fist
is
simply
not
working
as
a
means
of
establishing
general
peace
,
and
the
Bush
administration
will
have
to
finally
apply
effective
pressure
on
Sharon
to
stop
his
outrages
in
and
colonization
of
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
.
Sharon
's
hard
line
has
worked
in
tandem
with
Hamas
's
terrorism
to
ratchet
up
tensions
further
and
further
,
which
spill
over
into
the
Muslim
world
and
serve
as
a
recruiting
tool
for
al
-
Qaeda
in
its
search
for
agents
willing
to
hit
the
United
States
.
Israel
owes
the
United
States
at
least
this
much
,
in
this
crisis
,
to
cease
militarily
unnecessary
provocations
and
establish
genuine
peace
.
3
)
Make
Iraq
another
Afghanistan
,
using
the
Republican
Right
's
own
tactics
against
them
.
Response
:
Iraq
is
actually
hostile
territory
for
al
-
Qaeda
,
and
without
Iraqi
sympathizers
it
can
not
succeed
there
.
By
moving
quickly
to
Iraqi
sovereignty
and
improvement
of
Iraqi
lives
,
the
US
may
be
able
to
get
Iraqis
on
its
side
,
so
that
they
turn
in
the
foreigners
.
Certainly
,
the
Shiites
already
hate
al
-
Qaeda
and
would
help
;
likewise
the
Kurds
.
The
problem
of
mollifying
the
Sunnis
,
though
,
has
to
be
solved
to
avoid
giving
al
-
Qaeda
an
entrée
.
The
Americans
have
to
put
away
their
free
-
market
fetishism
for
a
while
and
find
ways
of
creating
jobs
and
pumping
money
into
Iraqi
households
.
We
need
an
FDR
in
Iraq
,
not
a
Ronald
Reagan
.
Of
course
,
the
sooner
the
US
soldiers
can
be
withdrawn
in
favor
of
less
-
provocative
local
or
international
forces
,
the
better
.
Getting
the
Spanish
out
of
Iraq
is
n't
nearly
as
good
a
rallying
cry
for
al
-
Qaeda
in
the
Arab
world
as
getting
the
Americans
and
British
out
.
The
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
Sunni
Arab
nationalists
and
Baathists
and
local
Sunni
radicals
are
likely
to
remain
far
more
dangerous
to
the
US
in
Iraq
than
al
-
Qaeda
infiltrators
,
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
take
one
's
eyes
off
the
former
ball
.
George
W.
Bush
alleged
Thursday
that
John
Edwards
lacks
the
experience
necessary
to
be
president
.
The
problem
with
this
argument
is
that
Bush
lacked
the
experience
necessary
to
be
president
when
he
ran
in
2000
,
so
this
sort
of
cheap
shot
just
hoists
him
by
his
own
petard
.
Let
's

remember
a
seminal
Bush

WASHINGTON
(
CNN

--
Texas
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
is
enduring
sharp
criticism
for
being
unable
to
name
the
leaders
of
four
current
world
hot
spots
,
but
President
Bill
Clinton
says
Bush
"
should
,
and
probably
will
,
pick
up
"
those
names
.
The
front
-
runner
for
the
2000
Republican
presidential
nomination
faltered
Thursday
in
an
international
affairs
pop
quiz
posed
by
Andy
Hiller
,
a
political
reporter
for
WHDH
-
TV
in
Boston
.
Bush
Hiller
asked
Bush
to
name
the
leaders
of
Chechnya
,
Taiwan
,
India
and
Pakistan
.
Bush
was
only
able
to
give
a
partial
response
to
the
query
on
the
leader
of
Taiwan
,
referring
to
Taiwanese
President
Lee
Teng
-
hui
simply
as
"
Lee
.
"
He
could
not
name
the
others
.
Can
you
name
the
general
who
is
in
charge
of
Pakistan
?
Hiller
asked
,
inquiring
about
Gen.
Pervaiz
Musharraf
,
who
seized
control
of
the
country
October
12
.
Wait
,
wait
,
is
this
50
questions
?
asked
Bush
.
Hiller
replied
:
"
No
,
it
's
four
questions
of
four
leaders
in
four
hot
spots
.
"
.
.
.
Bush
,
in
answering
the
question
about
the
leader
of
Pakistan
,
also
said
:
"
The
new
Pakistani
general
,
he
's
just
been
elected
--
not
elected
,
this
guy
took
over
office
.
It
appears
this
guy
is
going
to
bring
stability
to
the
country
and
I
think
that
's
good
news
for
the
subcontinent
.
"
Gore
released
a
statement
Friday
taking
Bush
to
task
for
his
comments
on
Pakistan
's
recent
coup
.
I
find
it
troubling
that
a
candidate
for
president
in
our
country
--
the
world
's
oldest
democracy
--
would
characterize
the
military
takeover
as
good
news
,
"
Gore
said
.
A
spokesman
for
President
Clinton
also
criticized
Bush
's
comments
.
It
is
very
dangerous
for
this
country
to
condone
the
overthrow
of
democratically
elected
governments
,
said
David
Leavy
,
spokesman
for
the
National
Security
Council
.
Not
only
did
Bush
not
know
who
General
Pervez
Musharraf
was
,
he
seems
to
have
confused
coup
-
making
with
"
taking
office
,
"
and
moreover
went
on
to
suggest
that
the
overthrow
of
an
elected
prime
minister
and
the
installation
in
power
of
the
Pakistan
military
,
then
the
world
's
strongest
supporter
of
the
Taliban
,
would
bring
"
stability
!
"
Musharraf
made
his
coup
in
part
because
of
the
military
's
anger
over
Prime
Minister
Nawaz
Sharif
's
willingness
to
back
down
from
confronting
India
over
Kashmir
,
so
that
he
explicitly
came
to
power
as
a
warmonger
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
ominous
I
found
Bush
's
performance
in
that
interview
.
I
still
remember
him
stuttering
about
"
the
General
,
"
unable
to
remember
Musharraf
's
name
.
He
obviously
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
,
though
he
demonstrated
a
number
of
ill
-
fated
instincts
.
He
obviously
liked
authoritarian
rule
better
than
democracy
,
equating
dictatorship
with
"
stability
.
"
And
,
he
did
n't
think
he
needed
to
know
anything
about
South
Asia
,
with
its
nuclear
giants
and
radical
religious
politics
--
the
latter
a
dire
security
threat
to
the
US
.
He
could
n't
tell
when
things
were
becoming
more
unstable
as
opposed
to
less
.
Musharraf
went
on
to
play
nuclear
brinkmanship
with
India
in
2002
,
risking
war
twice
that
year
.
Although
Musharraf
did
turn
against
the
Taliban
after
September
11
,
under
extreme
duress
from
the
US
,
elements
of
his
military
continued
to
support
radical
Islamism
and
have
recently
been
implicated
in
assassination
attempts
on
Musharraf
himself
.
This
was
the
body
that
Bush
proclaimed
was
bringing
"
stability
"
to
the
region
in
fall
of
1999
.
So
,
one
answer
to
Bush
's
charge
about
Edwards
is
that
if
it
had
any
merit
,
Bush
should
have
declined
to
run
himself
.
Another
answer
is
that
Edwards
certainly
knows
far
more
about
foreign
affairs
now
than
Bush
did
then
.
Indeed
,
given
how
Bush
has
rampaged
around
the
world
alienating
allies
and
ignoring
vital
conflicts
with
the
potential
to
blow
back
on
the
US
,
one
might
well
argue
that
Edwards
knows
more
now
than
Bush
does
.
This
is
what
Edwards
'
campaign
literature
said
about
his
positions
:
"
Edwards
believes
that
the
U.S.
must
be
an
active
leader
to
help
resolve
conflicts
,
from
reducing
tensions
between
India
and
Pakistan
to
the
peace
process
in
Northern
Ireland
.
Edwards
is
a
strong
supporter
of
Israel
,
and
believes
that
the
U.S.
has
a
vital
role
in
promoting
peace
between
the
Israelis
and
the
Palestinians
.
"
I
do
n't
see
Bush
doing
any
of
this
.
From
Friday
's
Daily
Star
By
Juan
Cole
Friday
,
June
04
,
2004
As
the
American
public
gradually
wearies
of
the
Iraq
crisis
,
some
have
begun
worrying
that
the
war
could
blow
back
on
the
US
by
creating
the
conditions
for
anti-American
terrorism
.
Israel
,
however
,
is
much
closer
to
Iraq
and
is
likely
to
suffer
from
Iraqi
instability
much
more
acutely
than
will
the
United
States
.
Ironically
,
among
the
strongest
proponents
of
war
in
Iraq
were
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ariel
Sharon
and
his
neoconservative
supporters
in
the
US
.
Have
they
,
however
,
actually
weakened
Israeli
security
?
The
biggest
threat
Israel
faces
is
not
from
conventional
armies
but
from
the
asymmetrical
tactics
of
Palestinian
national
liberation
movements
.
The
derailing
of
the
Oslo
peace
process
by
the
hard
-
line
policies
of
Sharon
and
the
Palestinian
intifada
has
encouraged
suicide
bombings
.
This
,
in
turn
,
has
discouraged
international
investment
in
Israel
and
has
made
it
less
likely
that
immigrants
to
the
country
will
actually
remain
there
.
Although
Israel
withdrew
from
Lebanese
territory
in
May
2000
,
the
radical
Lebanese
Shiite
party
,
Hizbullah
,
has
not
been
mollified
.
It
is
estimated
to
have
some
5,000
armed
fighters
,
and
they
have
pursued
attacks
against
Israeli
forces
to
compel
them
to
withdraw
from
the
Shebaa
Farms
,
a
sliver
of
Syrian
territory
that
Israel
annexed
after
the
1967
war
.
Any
thorough
assessment
of
the
impact
of
the
Iraq
war
and
its
aftermath
on
Israel
's
security
environment
must
,
therefore
,
closely
examine
its
likely
effect
on
the
conduct
of
asymmetrical
warfare
.
Although
it
is
often
alleged
(
without
much
evidence
)
that
Saddam
Hussein
gave
money
to
the
families
of
Palestinian
suicide
bombers
and
so
encouraged
asymmetrical
warfare
,
it
is
not
clear
that
he
actually
posed
a
danger
to
Israel
.
The
Palestinians
who
have
been
willing
to
kill
themselves
to
end
the
Israeli
occupation
of
the
Gaza
Strip
and
the
West
Bank
were
not
driven
by
economic
considerations
.
Saddam
never
did
anything
practical
to
help
the
Palestinians
.
At
some
points
,
as
in
the
late
1980s
,
he
reportedly
made
behind
-
the
-
scenes
overtures
to
the
Israelis
to
arrive
at
some
sort
of
a
deal
.
He
did
not
allow
Palestinian
radicals
to
launch
operations
against
Israel
from
Iraq
.
By
the
late
1990s
,
Iraq
had
no
nuclear
or
biological
weapons
program
,
and
had
destroyed
its
chemical
weapons
stockpiles
.
Its
ramshackle
army
had
virtually
collapsed
before
the
American
invasion
in
2003
.
If
it
is
hard
to
see
how
Baathist
Iraq
posed
any
real
threat
to
Israel
,
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
see
a
menace
in
the
current
instability
.
The
bungling
of
post-war
Iraq
by
the
Bush
administration
created
a
weak
and
failed
state
.
Armed
militias
,
many
staffed
by
former
Iraqi
military
men
with
substantial
training
and
experience
,
have
proliferated
.
The
US
chose
to
ally
itself
with
such
groups
as
the
Supreme
Council
for
the
Islamic
Revolution
in
Iraq
,
whose
15,000
-
strong
Badr
Corps
paramilitary
was
trained
by
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guards
.
Anti-Israeli
and
pro-Palestinian
feeling
is
strong
among
several
major
Iraqi
ideological
groups
and
currents
.
The
more
radical
Shiites
,
who
generally
follow
the
theocratic
notions
of
Iran
's
Ayatollah
Ruhollah
Khomeini
,
routinely
chant
and
demonstrate
against
Israel
.
They
vehemently
protested
the
Israeli
assassination
of
Sheikh
Ahmed
Yassin
,
the
leader
of
Hamas
,
last
March
.
Worse
for
Israel
,
the
assassination
drew
a
denunciation
even
from
the
moderate
and
cautious
Grand
Ayatollah
Ali
Sistani
,
who
wields
enormous
moral
authority
over
Iraqi
Shiites
.
These
Shiite
movements
had
been
suppressed
by
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
,
but
have
now
organized
and
armed
themselves
.
They
have
also
reestablished
their
historical
links
with
Lebanese
and
Iranian
Shiites
.
It
is
inevitable
that
most
Iraqi
Shiites
will
side
with
their
Hizbullah
coreligionists
against
Israel
,
and
it
seems
likely
that
Iraqi
Shiites
will
get
rich
enough
from
Iraqi

Sunni

sympathize

and
those

have
deep
historical
inks
with
fundamentalists
in

Iraqi
cities
such
as
Fallujah

Amman
to

,
and
so
came
under
the
influence
of
the
Salafi
movement
,
which
is
popular
in

.
Secular
Arab

groups
also

are
no

.
Whereas

they
are

An

inevitably
a

If

be

Israel
's

be

Ariel

have
created
unprecedented

has
spread
throughout

The

by

in

-
has

India
defensive
over
Sri
Lanka
By
Ranjit
Devraj
NEW
DELHI
-
While
India
is
ready
to
enter
into
a
"
defense
cooperation
agreement
"
with
Sri
Lanka
,
it
is
wary
of
being
drawn
into
any
military
involvement
in
the
island
nation
's
two
decades
-
old
civil
war
that
has
seen
violent
strife
between
ethnic
Tamils
and
the
Sinhalese
majority
-
leaving
over
60,000
dead
on
both
sides
.
And
that
explains
the
delay
in
the
signing
of
a
formal
defense
agreement
that
was
at
the
heart
of
Sri
Lankan
President
Chandrika
Kumaratunga
's
four
-
day
visit
to
India
recently
.
According
to
Professor
S
D
Muni
,
South
Asia
expert
at
the
Jawaharal
Nehru
University
,
the
two
-
year
peace
talks
between
Colombo
and
the
Liberation
Tigers
of
Tamil
Eelam
(
LTTE
)
are
stalemated
.
For
that
reason
,
he
said
,
Kumaratunga
's
government
was
keen
to
beef
up
military
preparedness
with
Indian
support
.
And
the
Tigers
look
as
if
they
are
on
the
brink
of
launching
another
offensive
,
"
Muni
told
IPS
.
Colombo
held
six
rounds
of
talks
with
the
Tigers
between
September
2002
and
March
2003
.
But
last
April
,
the
rebels
abruptly
pulled
out
of
negotiations
demanding
recognition
,
first
,
for
the
right
to
self
-
rule
before
proceeding
any
further
.
Kumaratunga
's
India
tour
preceded
a
three
-
day
visit
to
Sri
Lanka
by
Norwegian
Foreign
Minister
Jan
Petersen
in
a
new
bid
to
revive
the
peace
talks
that
were
supposed
to
follow
a
ceasefire
that
Oslo
successfully
brokered
in
February
2002
.
Petersen
held
discussions
with
both
Kumaratunga
and
the
reclusive
LTTE
leader
Velupillai
Prabhakaran
in
the
rebel
stronghold
of
Kilinochchi
without
success
,
and
chief
Tamil
rebel
negotiator
Anton
Balasingham
and
Norwegian
envoy
Erik
Solheim
held
closed
-
door
talks
at
the
international
airport
late
Saturday
in
an
effort
to
keep
the
salvage
effort
on
track
,
diplomatic
sources
said
.
But
they
,
too
,
failed
.
Colombo
,
too
,
seems
to
be
in
an
intractable
position
.
According
to
former
Indian
army
general
A
S
Kalkat
,
the
difficulty
for
Kumaratunga
's
government
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
LTTE
had
become
a
de
jure
power
in
the
north
and
east
of
the
island
and
was
running
every
aspect
of
civil
administration
in
the
areas
within
its
control
.
A
veteran
of
India
's
military
intervention
in
the
Jaffna
peninsula
to
help
implement
the
1987
Indo
-
Sri
Lanka
Peace
Accord
-
which
ambitiously
provided
for
the
disarming
of
the
formidable
LTTE
-
Kalkat
said
the
new
defense
deal
would
essentially
be
a
reiteration
of
the
older
one
minus
its
military
commitment
.
Kalkat
,
who
currently
chairs
the
independent
US
-
based
International
Council
on
Conflict
Resolution
,
said
despite
the
failure
of
the
Indian
army
to
disarm
or
even
subdue
the
Tigers
,
India
remained
the
only
power
capable
of
influencing
the
course
of
the
current
peace
talks
.
The
Norwegians
mean
well
but
their
role
is
limited
to
that
of
honest
broker
and
the
LTTE
is
keenly
aware
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
[
unlike
India
]
to
underwrite
any
arrangement
,
Kalkat
told
IPS
in
an
interview
.
In
1987
,
the
Tamil
Tigers
reluctantly
accepted
the
peace
accord
under
Indian
pressure
.
Under
the
accord
,
a
new
northeastern
provincial
council
was
formed
and
the
Indian
army
was
deployed
as
peacekeepers
in
the
north
and
east
.
However
,
differences
between
India
and
LTTE
soon
surfaced
and
led
to
clashes
between
Tiger
guerrillas
and
the
Indian
peace
keeping
force
.
About
1,200
Indian
soldiers
were
killed
during
this
phase
of
the
conflict
.
India
had
to
pull
back
its
forces
from
Sri
Lanka
in
1989
following
the
election
of
Ranasinghe
Premadasa
,
a
strong
critic
of
Indian
mediation
.
Last
June
,
an
international
initiative
led
by
Japan
to
persuade
the
LTTE
to
come
back
to
the
negotiating
table
failed
despite
an
aid
package
offer
of
US$
4.5
billion
.
Japan
's
special
envoy
,
Yasushi
Akashi
,
who
called
for
tangible
progress
in
the
peace
process
before
the
money
would
be
released
,
came
back
from
visits
to
Colombo
and
Kilinochchi
in
early
November
a
frustrated
man
.
He
complained
about
the
"
visible
lack
of
progress
"
and
reaching
an
impasse
in
talks
with
both
sides
.
The
Tigers
'
chief
ideologue
,
Balasingham
,
sniffed
at
the
proposal
saying
that
"
a
solution
to
the
ethnic
conflict
can
not
be
predetermined
by
the
resolutions
or
declarations
of
donor
conferences
,
but
has
to
be
negotiated
by
the
parties
in
conflict
without
the
constraints
of
external
forces
.
"
But
there
are
strong
hints
in
the
country
that
a
new
Indo
-
Sri
Lanka
defense
deal
could
be
in
the
making
.
And
this
has
already
drawn
protests
from
the
Tamil
National
Alliance
(
TNA
)
which
was
backed
by
the
LTTE
in
the
April
general
elections
held
in
Sri
Lanka
.
Tamils
feel
that
the
proposed
defense
agreement
between
India
and
Sri
Lanka
would
encourage
Sinhala
rulers
to
prepare
for
another
war
abandoning
the
current
peace
process
,
TNA
member
of
parliament
P
Sithamparanathan
was
quoted
as
saying
in
a
statement
.
She
added
that
recent
visits
to
the
island
by
India
's
top
military
brass
including
army
chief
General
Nirmal
Chander
Vij
have
"
caused
apprehension
among
Tamils
that
preparations
are
under
way
for
another
war
in
the
island
"
.
But
Kalkat
pointed
out
that
India
would
be
ill
-
advised
to
be
involved
again
,
militarily
,
with
Sri
Lanka
if
only
because
it
still
had
to
consider
the
sentiments
of
45
million
ethnic
Tamils
in
the
Indian
state
of
Tamil
Nadu
-
separated
from
Sri
Lanka
's
Jaffna
peninsula
by
the
narrow
Palk
Straits
.
Apart
from
the
1,200
Indian
lives
lost
in
1987
,
the
Indian
peacekeeping
force
was
immensely
unpopular
not
only
in
Tamil
Nadu
and
the
Jaffna
peninsula
but
also
among
the
Sinhalese
majority
who
considered
it
a
violation
of
their
country
's
sovereignty
.
The
best
option
,
now
,
under
the
present
difficult
circumstances
is
for
Colombo
to
do
its
own
dirty
work
,
although
New
Delhi
can
always
be
counted
on
to
render
good
neighborly
help
because
of
the
shared
belief
that
religion
,
ethnicity
and
language
can
not
be
the
basis
for
secession
.
In
any
case
,
Kalkat
puts
it
succinctly
:
"
There
can
not
be
a
military
option
to
what
is
a
political
situation
.

Unreported
by
the
international
media
,
the
Valley
of
Kashmir
has
seen
an
ethnic
and
cultural
genocide
that
has
resulted
in
the
fleeing
from
the
valley
of
almost
all
the
Hindu
families
who
have
been
living
there
since
human
habitation
was
first
recorded
.
Over
nine
dozen
temples
that
had
served
the
Hindu
population
have
been
destroyed
,
with
some
used
as
building
material
and
others
as
urinals
.
Thus
far
,
none
of
the
many
"
human
rights
"
busybodies
across
the
world
have
bothered
to
even
notice
such
a
development
.
Musharraf
calls
the
bluff
M.D.
Nalapat
While
most
U.S.
secretaries
of
state
--
save
perhaps
Dean
Rusk
--
have
gobbled
up
credit
for
outcomes
that
they
had
little
to
do
with
,
few
have
been
as
brazen
as
Colin
Powell
.
Two
years
ago
,
Pakistani
President
Pervez
Musharraf
was
surprised
when
the
leader
of
the
main
Islamist
alliance
--
Maulana
Fazlur
Rahman
--
visited
India
and
issued
a
series
of
highly
conciliatory
statements
.
As
Pakistan
's
president
had
been
telling
the
United
States
he
was
"
forced
"
into
taking
a
hawkish
line
on
India
precisely
by
the
likes
of
Rahman
,
this
was
an
embarrassment
.
The
reality
is
that
India
is
no
longer
the
enemy
of
choice
for
the
people
of
Pakistan
.
That
distinction
has
now
gone
to
the
United
States
.
Realists
,
and
this
even
includes
members
of
the
U.S.
Democratic
foreign
policy
establishment
such
as
Strobe
Talbott
,
who
have
long
sought
to
divest
India
of
its
defensive
capability
against
another
nuclear
power
in
Asia
,
understand
the
only
feasible
solution
for
Kashmir
is
the
acceptance
of
the
status
quo
.
India
keeps
what
it
has
while
Pakistan
and
China
(
which
was
gifted
a
slice
of
the
territory
three
decades
ago
)
do
likewise
.
Simultaneously
,
New
Delhi
would
ensure
a
degree
of
autonomy
for
the
state
that
would
help
cut
popular
support
off
from
jihadis
attempting
to
convert
Kashmir
into
a
second
Afghanistan
.
Bill
Clinton
understood
this
at
the
end
of
his
term
in
office
yet
,
under
Colin
Powell
(
who
appears
to
have
an
affinity
for
generals
active
in
politics
)
,
the
pendulum
of
U.S.
policy
has
once
again
swung
toward
a
quixotic
effort
to
prize
at
least
the
Valley
of
Kashmir
loose
from
India
.
This
,
Pakistan
's
lobbyist
in
Washington
Christina
Rocca
has
been
told
,
is
the
"
minimum
"
that
the
Pakistan
army
will
accept
.
It
is
also
far
more
than
what
any
administration
in
New
Delhi
can
deliver
.
This
writer
has
for
years
regarded
the
best
solution
to
the
Kashmir
problem
as
being
the
trifurcation
of
the
Indian
part
of
the
state
into
a
Hindu
-
majority
Jammu
,
a
Buddhist
-
dominated
Ladakh
and
the
overwhelmingly
Muslim
Kashmir
Valley
,
with
the
third
state
given
little
of
taxpayers
'
money
but
substantial
autonomy
.
With
luck
,
the
Kashmir
Valley
can
attract
investment
from
the
Middle
East
and
other
locations
where
Muslims
are
dominant
and
become
a
tourist
,
education
and
services
haven
within
India
.
The
overwhelming
majority
of
Muslims
in
Kashmir
would
be
happy
with
such
an
outcome
,
except
for
the
tiny
jihadi
segment
patronized
by
the
U.S.
State
Department
and
the
Pakistan
Army
,
which
would
like
to
even
the
score
with
India
for
their
catastrophic
defeat
in
Bangladesh
in
1971
.
Unreported
by
the
international
media
,
the
Valley
of
Kashmir
has
seen
an
ethnic
and
cultural
genocide
that
has
resulted
in
the
fleeing
from
the
valley
of
almost
all
the
Hindu
families
who
have

Over
nine
dozen

that
had
served
the
Hindu
population
have
been
destroyed
,
with

and

as
urinals
.
Thus
far
,
none
of
the
many
"
human
rights
"
busybodies
across
the
world
have
bothered
to
even
notice
such
a
development
.
Indeed
,
their
reports
are
filled
with
tales
of
the
"
atrocities
"
of
Indian
troops
on
the
innocent
jihadis
.
Despite
Sept.
11
,
the
United
States
still
supports
the
Kashmir
groups
that
back
jihad
as
part
of
the
price
Washington
is
paying
to
keep
Pervez
Musharraf
happy
.
Unfortunately
for
them
,
the
general
has
decided
to
take
seriously
Colin
Powell
's
frequent
boasts
that
it
was
on
his
nudging
that
the
Indians
made
conciliatory
gestures
toward
Islamabad
.
The
U.S.
State
Department
and
the
misnamed
think
tanks
that
follow
its
lead
have
held
numerous
conferences
on
Kashmir
and
,
in
most
of
them
,
the
solution
that
has
emerged
is
a
valley
prized
loose
from
Indian
control
and
under
its
own
version
of
Ibrahim
Rugova
.
That
India
is
not
Yugoslavia
and
that
the
"
foreigner
-
led
"
Indian
National
Congress
can
least
afford
to
ignore
Indian
nationalism
,
has
not
struck
the
conferees
,
among
whom
have
been
several
Indian
"
scholars
"
and
"
analysts
"
ready
to
say
and
endorse
anything
for
the
sake
of
a
free
trip
to
New
York
or
Vienna
.
Despite
many
wrinkles
,
India
remains
a
part
-
democracy
and
merely
signing
on
to
a
piece
of
paper
that
calls
for
an
independent
Kashmir
does
not
get
you
into
the
trouble
that
writing
an
op
-
ed
piece
against
Sonia
Gandhi
or
Atal
Behari
Vajpayee
would
instantly
.
It
was
the
business
community
in
India
that
stepped
in
after
Vajpayee
indulged
in
an
empty
bout
of
saber
rattling
in
2002
,
pointing
out
that
the
only
beneficiary
of
the
mythical
perception
that
war
--
especially
nuclear
war
--
was
around
the
corner
in
the
subcontinent
was
China
.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
India
is
emerging
as
an
alternative
investment
destination
to
China
,
hence
the
favor
that
the
generals
in
Islamabad
do
to
their
trusty
supplier
of
nukes
and
missiles
by
creating
a
scare
about
war
involving
India
when
in
fact
the
real
flashpoints
are
the
Taiwan
Straits
and
North
Korea
.
Since
then
,
India
has
talked
peace
while
always
signaling
that
only
the
status
quo
would
be
acceptable
as
a
final
settlement
:
a
line
of
action
that
is
followed
in
the
case
of
disputes
with
China
as
well
.
Unfortunately
for
those
eager
to
indefinitely
carry
on
with
the
lucrative
business
of
conflict
resolution
in
South
Asia
,
Pervez
Musharraf
has
now
called
Colin

challenging
him
to
deliver
on
his
frequent
statements
implying
that
the
Indians
jump
to
his

.
Once
the
Manmohan

government
shows
that
it
has
little
appetite
for

,
Musharraf
will
face
the
moment
of

:
accept

,
or
once

ramp
up
the

and
spawn
a
fresh
lot
of
killers
that
can
hit
not
merely
Mumbai

New

but
London
and
Chicago
as
well

The
one
country
that
has
shown
that
it

in

is
China

Under

,
Beijing
has

Prime

Wen

is

formally
accepting

Ok
.
We
all
know
that
John
Kerry
served
in
Vietnam
.
Four
whole
months
,
after
which
he
took
advantage
of
a
little
-
known
,
little
-
invoked
regulation
that
allowed
him
to
desert
his
"
band
of
brothers
"
.
We
also
know
how
Dan
Rather
libeled
George
Bush
and
impugned
his
service
in
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
on
a
"
60
Minutes
II
"
report
based
largely
on
forged
documents
.
During
his
time
in
the
Guard
,
George
Bush
flew
the
F
-
102
Delta
Dagger
fighter
-
interceptor
.
The
F
-
102
saw
service
in
the
Vietnam
theater
between
March
1962
and
December
1969
.
During
this
time
,
F
-
102
squadrons
were
based
out
of
Tan
Son
Nhut
,
Da
Nang
and
Bien
Hoa
in
Vietnam
,
and
Udorn
and
Don
Muang
in
Thailand
.

As
far
as
George
Bush
knew
,
he
and
his
unit
could
have
been
transferred
to
Vietnam
.
In
all
this
so
-
called
controversy
,
has
anyone
considered
that
perhaps
George
Bush
just
wanted
to
fly
jets
?
And
,
let
's
remember
,
flying
supersonic
fighter
jets
is
dangerous
!
They
do
n't
let
just
anybody
do
it
.
Some
reporters
(
you
know
,
the
ones
with
journalistic
ethics
)
have
actually
uncovered
the
truth
about
George
Bush
's
service
in
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
.
For
example
,
did
you
know
that
George
Bush
spent
considerably
more
time
in
uniform
than
John
Kerry
?
What
follows
is
the
text
of
an
e-mail
sent

---------
Bush
’s
National
Guard
years
Before
you
fall
for
Dems
’
spin
,
here
are
the
facts
What
do
you
really
know
about
George
W.
Bush
’s
time
in
the
Air
National
Guard
?
That
he
did
n’t
show
up
for
duty
in
Alabama
?
That
he
missed
a
physical
?
That
his
daddy
got
him
in
?
News
coverage
of
the
president
’s
years
in
the
Guard
has
tended
to
focus
on
one
brief
portion
of
that
time
—
to
the
exclusion
of
virtually
everything
else
.
So
just
for
the
record
,
here
,
in
full
,
is
what
Bush
did
:
The
future
president
joined
the
Guard
in
May
1968
.
Almost
immediately
,
he
began
an
extended
period
of
training
.
Six
weeks
of
basic
training
.
Fifty
-
three
weeks
of
flight
training
.
Twenty
-
one
weeks
of
fighter
-
interceptor
training
.
That
was
80
weeks
to
begin
with
,
and
there
were
other
training
periods
thrown
in
as
well
.
It
was
full
-
time
work
.
By
the
time
it
was
over
,
Bush
had
served
nearly
two
years
.
Not
two
years
of
weekends
.
Two
years
.
After
training
,
Bush
kept
flying
,
racking
up
hundreds
of
hours
in
F
-
102
jets
.
As
he
did
,
he
accumulated
points
toward
his
National
Guard
service
requirements
.
At
the
time
,
guardsmen
were
required
to
accumulate
a
minimum
of
50
points
to
meet
their
yearly
obligation
.
According
to
records
released
earlier
this
year
,
Bush
earned
253
points
in
his
first
year
,
May
1968
to
May
1969
(
since
he
joined
in
May
1968
,
his
service
thereafter
was
measured
on
a
May
-
to
-
May
basis
)
.
Bush
earned
340
points
in
1969
-
1970
.
[
In
other
words
,
Bush
earned
enough
points
to
satisfy
the
requirements
for
his
entire
six
year
hitch
in
1969
-
1970
alone
.
-
acd
]
He
earned
137
points
in
1970
-
1971
.
And
he
earned
112
points
in
1971
-
1972
.
The
numbers
indicate
that
in
his
first
four
years
,
Bush
not
only
showed
up
,
he
showed
up
a
lot
.
Did
you
know
that
?
That
brings
the
story
to
May
1972
—
the
time
that
has
been
the
focus
of
so
many
news
reports
—
when
Bush
“
deserted
”
(
according
to
anti-Bush
filmmaker
Michael
Moore
)
or
went
“
AWOL
”
(
according
to
Terry
McAuliffe
,
chairman
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
)
.
Bush
asked
for
permission
to
go
to
Alabama
to
work
on
a
Senate
campaign
.
His
superior
officers
said
OK
.
Requests
like
that
were
n’t
unusual
,
says
retired
Col.
William
Campenni
,
who
flew
with
Bush
in
1970
and
1971
.
“
In
1972
,
there
was
an
enormous
glut
of
pilots
,
”
Campenni
says
.
“
The
Vietnam
War
was
winding
down
,
and
the
Air
Force
was
putting
pilots
in
desk
jobs
.
In
’72
or
’73
,
if
you
were
a
pilot
,
active
or
Guard
,
and
you
had
an
obligation
and
wanted
to
get
out
,
no
problem
.
In
fact
,
you
were
helping
them
solve
their
problem
.
”
So
Bush
stopped
flying
.
From
May
1972
to
May
1973
,
he
earned
just
56
points
—
not
much
,
but
enough
to
meet
his
requirement
.
Then
,
in
1973
,
as
Bush
made
plans
to
leave
the
Guard
and
go
to
Harvard
Business
School
,
he
again
started
showing
up
frequently
.
In
June
and
July
of
1973
,
he
accumulated
56
points
,
enough
to
meet
the
minimum
requirement
for
the
1973
-
1974
year
.
Then
,
at
his
request
,
he
was
given
permission
to
go
.
Bush
received
an
honorable
discharge
after
serving
five
years
,
four
months
and
five
days
of
his
original
six
-
year
commitment
.
By
that
time
,
however
,
he
had
accumulated
enough
points
in
each
year
to
cover
six
years
of
service
.
During
his
service
,
Bush
received
high
marks
as
a
pilot
.
A
1970
evaluation
said
Bush
“
clearly
stands
out
as
a
top
notch
fighter
interceptor
pilot
”
and
was
“
a
natural
leader
whom
his
contemporaries
look
to
for
leadership
.
”
A
1971
evaluation
called
Bush
“
an
exceptionally
fine
young
officer
and
pilot
”
who
“
continually
flies
intercept
missions
with
the
unit
to
increase
his
proficiency
even
further
.
”
And
a
1972
evaluation
called
Bush
“
an
exceptional
fighter
interceptor
pilot
and
officer
.
”
Now
,
it
is
only
natural
that
news
reports
questioning
Bush
’s
service
—
in
The
Boston
Globe
and
The
New
York
Times
,
on
CBS
and
in
other
outlets
—
would
come
out
now
.
Democrats
are
spitting
mad
over
attacks
on
John
Kerry
’s
record
by
the
group
Swift
Boat
Veterans
for
Truth
.
And
,
as
it
is
with
Kerry
,
it
’s
reasonable
to
look
at
a
candidate
’s
entire
record
,
including
his
military
service
—
or
lack
of
it
.
Voters
are
perfectly
able
to
decide
whether
it
’s
important
or
not
in
November
.
The
Kerry
camp
blames
Bush
for
the
Swift
boat
veterans
’
attack
,
but
anyone
who
has
spent
much
time
talking
to
the
Swifties
gets
the
sense
that
they
are
doing
it
entirely
for
their
own
reasons
.
And
it
should
be
noted
in
passing
that
Kerry
has
personally
questioned
Bush
’s
service
,
while
Bush
has
not
personally
questioned
Kerry
’s
.
In
April
—
before
the
Swift
boat
veterans
had
said
a
word
—
Kerry
said
Bush
“
has
yet
to
explain
to
America
whether
or
not
,
and
tell
the
truth
,
about
whether
he
showed
up
for
duty
.
”
Earlier
,
Kerry
said
,
“
Just
because
you
get
an
honorable
discharge
does
not
,
in
fact
,
answer
that
question
.
”
Now
,
after
the
Swift
boat
episode
,
the
spotlight
has
returned
to
Bush
.
That
’s
fine
.
We
should
know
as
much
as
we
can
.
And
perhaps
someday
Kerry
will
release
more
of
his
military
records
as
well
.
Byron
York
is
a
White
House
correspondent
for
National
Review
.
His
column
appears
in
The
Hill
each
week
.
One
week
to
elections
day
and
the
general
atmosphere
in
the
capital
is
eerie
,
yet
strikingly
familiar
.
I
suspect
the
streets
of
Baghdad
will
look
as
if
a
war
is
looming
this
week
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
many
Iraqis
regard
the
date
of
30
January
as
a
day
of
renewed
hope
,
one
they
have
been
awaiting
all
their
lives
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
many
others
are
already
dreading
it
.
The
interim
government
has
promised
security
measures
that
would
reduce
the
violence
on
the
day
of
elections
,
but
I
fail
to
see
how
they
will
be
able
to
protect
all
5,000
(
or
so
)
balloting
centres
.
Many
voting
centres
have
already
been
successfully
attacked
or
destroyed
in
many
areas
.
Now
that
the
picture
is
clear
,
the
two
main
competing
lists
seem
to
be
the
United
Iraqi
Coalition
list
and
Allawi
's
Al
-
Iraqiya
list
.
Ayad
Allawi
,
and
other
ministers
running
on
his
list
,
have
quite
expectedly
used
their
governmental
positions
in
campaigning
.
One
minister
reportedly
handed
out
100
dollar
'
gifts
'
to
journalists
attending
a
press
conference
for
Allawi
,
a
practice
that
brings
back
bad
memories
to
many
Iraqis
.
Sheikh
Naji
Al
-
Abbudi
,
a
spokesman
for
Sistani
,
affirmed
the
claims
that
the
Grand
Ayatollah
is
backing
the
United
Iraqi
Coalition
list
.
Indeed
,
Sistani
's
agents
all
over
the
country
have
been
quite
active
in
educating
Iraqi
Shia
on
the
merits
of
elections
,
which
has
led
to
the
assassination
of
at
least
two
of
them
.
Al
-
Abbudi
stated
that
"
His
Emminence
"
decided
to
openly
support
the
list
because
"
others
"
(
obviously
a
reference
to
Allawi
)
have
been
abusing
official
state
positions
and
media
outlets
in
their
campaigning
.
Again
there
is
no
official
written
statement
from
Sistani
's
office
confirming
this
allegation
,
which
I
think
is
intentional
.
Ahmed
Al
-
Chalabi
and
defense
minister
Hazim
Al
-
Sha'lan
have
been
engaging
in
shrill
public
attacks
over
the
media
.
Chalabi
describing
Sha'lan
as
a
"
Ba'athist
"
and
a
"
former
double
agent
for
Saddam
and
the
CIA
"
,
while
Sha'lan
dismisses
Chalabi
as
a
"
thief
"
and
an
"
Iranian
stooge
who
longs
for
his
own
origins
by
defending
Iran
"
.
One
remark
made
by
Sha'lan
on
Al
-
Arabiya
TV
,
that
he
could
n't
say
more
about
Chalabi
because
he
would
embarrass
himself
and
the
viewers
almost
made
me
roll
on
the
floor
.
It
was
an
extremely
amusing
episode
,
watching
Chalabi
looking
smug
and
amused
,
contrasted
with
Sha'lan
,
all
serious
and
barely
keeping
himself
from
swearing
.
Fistfights
,
please
.
Hazim
Al
-
Sha'lan
,
by
the
way
,
is
the
son
of
the
late
Sheikh
of
Al
-
Khaza'il
in
Diwaniya
and
has
the
potential
to
replace
former
information
minister
,
M.S.
Al
-
Sahaf
,
in
his
nonsensical
media
statements
,
which
can
be
passed
as
jokes
.
The
main
Kurdish
coalition
list
(
PUK
and
KDP
)
is
barely
mentioned
outside
the
Kurdish
region
.
Even
there
,
many
Kurds
look
and
act
as
if
they
are
going
to
grab
the
chance
to
vote
them
out
of
power
.
I
doubt
that
will
be
the
outcome
though
.
Many
Iraqis
,
including
conservative
and
religious
Iraqis
,
are
surprisingly
rooting
for
the
Iraqi
Communist
party
,
probably
in
an
attempt
to
counter
the
influence
of
Islamists
in
the
forthcoming
National
Assembly
.
The
Communist
party
has
the
largest
number
of
registered
party
members
in
the
country
and
can
be
considered
as
the
oldest
popular
political
party
in
Iraq
.
Its
support
base
is
much
larger
than
what
it
seems
.
***
Several
candidates
were
assassinated
and
targeted
these
last
two
weeks
,
others
have
been
forced
under
threats
to
withdraw
and
to
follow
the
example
of
the
Islamic
party
.
Sectarian
tensions
are
at
their
highest
since
April
,
2004
,
with
Sunni
insurgents
now
openly
attacking
Husseiniyas
and
Shia
mosques
.
I
had
an
interesting
conversation
with
a
middle
-
aged
taxi
driver
who
used
to
live
in
Fallujah
and
is
now
at
relatives
in
Amiriya
,
Baghdad
.
After
asking
me
which
tribe
I
belong
to
(
thus
assessing
my
sectarian
background
)
he
started
hurling
abuses
at
the
Shia
,
calling
them
Persians
,
Majoos
(
fire
worshippers
)
,
rabid
dogs
and
a
handful
of
other
descriptions
that
I
ca
n't
mention
here
.
He
described
Allawi
's
face
as
that
of
a
f*ed
horse
and
he
dismissed
the
whole
government
as
a
band
of
thieves
and
traitors
.
I
did
n't
argue
with
him
but
I
asked
him
what
he
believed
would
be
a
viable
solution
to
this
mess
.
He
said
that
resistance
was
the
only
commonsense
solution
.
First
driving
out
the
Americans
,
then
fighting
the
Shia
back
into
submission
(
as
in
1991
)
.
Sunni
Iraqis
contend
that
elections
are
impossible
to
hold
under
occupation
.
Leaving
aside
the
fact
that
this
views
conflicts
with
other
historical
examples
in
the
region
,
Sunnis
have
never
offered
an
alternative
choice
,
which
eventually
leads
one
to
guess
that
the
opinion
held
by
the
Fallujan
taxi
driver
above
is
precisely
what
they
are
planning
to
implement
.
I
had
another
conversation
some
months
ago
with
a
retired
Ba'athist
old
-
timer
who
claimed
that
Ba'athists
have
the
means
to
stage
a
third
coup
d'etat
and
return
to
power
within
10
hours
of
an
American
withdrawal
.
On
sensing
my
incredulity
to
his
statement
he
asserted
that
Ba'athist
cells
exist
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
that
they
do
have
a
central
command
,
even
though
many
have
formed
seperate
cells
(
often
under
Islamic
labels
)
with
their
own
leaderships
.
He
said
that
they
have
the
training
and
the
funding
as
well
as
the
support
of
neighbouring
and
regional
governments
.
I
concur
that
Ba'athists
and
former
security
forces
are
capable
of
immediately
controlling
at
least
5
out
of
18
governorates
,
along
with
the
capital
,
if
Americans
are
to
be
removed
from
the
picture
entirely
.
But
I
also
see
that
as
a
fatal
misconception
,
which
is
doing
Sunnis
harm
,
because
I
do
n't
believe
the
US
is
going
anywhere
so
soon
.
Any
government
that
assumes
power
after
the
elections
also
realises
this
,
so
not
even
Sistani
is
going
to
call
the
US
to
withdraw
its
troops
,
despite
what
he
is
saying
now
,
not
until
they
are
ensured
the
insurgency
is
out
of
the
picture
,
or
that
they
have
an
alternative
foreign
power
(
in
this
case
Iran
)
to
back
them
up
.
The
only
hope
now
is
that
,
following
the
elections
,
the
National
Assembly
would
offer
the
hand
of
peace
and
reconciliation
to
the
dissenting
parties
.
I
would
suggest
going
for
tribal
Sheikhs
rather
than
clerics
,
since
they
have
the
upper
hand
in
their
areas
and
can
effectively
root
out
any
Ba'athists
in
their
midst
in
return
for
a
promise
of
sharing
power
and
authority
.
Many
of
these
Sheikhs
have
been
disenfranchised
and
abused
over
the
last
two
years
.
Very
recently
,
US
forces
in
Al
-
Anbar
made
a
terrible
blunder
by
accidentally
killing
Abdul
-
Razaq
Inad
Al
-
Gu'ud
,
Sheikh
of
the
Al
-
Bu
Nimr
clan
from
the
powerful
Dulaym
tribe
.
Al
-
Gu'ud
had
favoured
elections
and
was
in
good
terms
with
the
government
.
The
Gu'ud
family
even
accepted
to
be
offered
the
seat
of
Al
-
Anbar
governor
some
months
back
.
The
Al
-
Bu
Nimr
in
Ramadi
and
Al
-
Qaim
rose
in
arms
against
Saddam
in
the
mid-nineties
following
the
execution
of
Thamir
Madhlum
Al
-
Dulaymi
,
an
Air
Force
general
belonging
to
their
tribe
.
The
revolt
took
two
weeks
to
be
suppressed
by
the
Republican
Guard
.
Another
bad
step
was
the
recent
arrest
of
Sheikh
Hassan
Al
-
Lihabi
,
of
the
Lihaib
tribe
which
is
scattered
between
the
governorates
of
Al
-
Anbar
,
Mosul
and
Salah
Al
-
Din
.
Al
-
Lihaibi
was
running
in
elections
and
is
now
said
to
have
withdrawn
following
this
incident
.
I
believe
national
reconciliation
to
be
the
only
path
forward
to
a
new
Iraq
.
The
Shia
can
not
live
without
the
Sunnis
,
and
vice
versa
.
Both
have
shared
this
country
for
the
last
14
centuries
and
there
is
no
possible
way
that
one
can
live
without
the
other
.
Even
partition
is
not
a
possibility
,
there
are
no
clear
borders
between
the
two
.
Remember
Luis
Posada
Carriles
?
Here
's
a
Miami
Herald
interview
with
the
relaxed
terrorist
and
former
CIA
operative
in
a
luxury
condo
,
published
yesterday
.
(
"
At
first
I
hid
a
lot
.
I
thought
the
US
government
was
looking
for
me
.
Now
I
hide
a
lot
less
.
"
)
Because
of
such
talk
,
Posada
has
been
taken
into
custody
by
Immigration
officials
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
they
wanted
to
do
this
.
Authorities
would
likely
have
been
happy
answering
questions
about
Posada
's
whereabouts
with
an
indefinite
shrug
.
As
recently
as
last
week
the
official
line
stated
they
had
no
knowledge
he
had
entered
the
country
.
But
comfortable
among
the
thugs
,
Posada
overplayed
his
hand
and
embarrassed
his
old
patron
,
the
US
government
.
And
though
he
'd
been
a
faithful
servant
,
he
was
not
such
a
player
that
he
could
get
away
with
that
.
He
should
have
taken
a
cue
from
another
bomber
some
pesky
dark
-
skinned
foreigners
want
extradited
,
CIA
operative
Michael
Meiring
.
Posada
should
have
told
any
inquisitive
journalist
at
his
doorstep
something
like
Meiring
told
the
single
American
reporter
who
bothered
following
his
bloody
trail
from
the
Philippines
,
that
"
If
this
harms
me
in
any
way
,
you
will
find
my
power
then
,
and
you
'll
find
out
who
I
am
.
"
But
then
,
maybe
that
would
n't
have
saved
him
either
,
because
Posada
is
not
Meiring
.
Posada
can
be
given
up
,
but
Meiring
ca
n't
.
Meiring
's
crimes
are
fresh
,
and
wave
the
false
flag
which
is
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
They
happened
in
the
Philippines
which
,
like
Pakistan
,
is
an
important
and
vulnerable
node
for
the
business
which
intelligence
agencies
and
terrorist
organizations
conduct
with
each
other
.
(
Ask
Terry
Nichols
about
the
Philippines
.
)
The
bombings
implicated
Muslims
,
and
exacerbated
regional
tensions
which
the
Bush
regime
and
its
friends
wearing
the
brass
in
the
Philippine
military
sought
to
exploit
.
Posada
's
crimes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
must
seem
like
ancient
history
,
especially
to
a
people
who
do
n't
know
their
history
.
And
to
those
who
do
n't
even
know
their
crimes
,
not
even
that
.
But
will
Posada
be
given
up
?
I
doubt
he
will
be
extradited
to
Venezuela
,
which
is
the
only
way
that
question
could
be
answered
with
a
Yes
.
I
expect
it
will
be
determined
that
,
under
"
Strong
Man
"
Hugo
Chavez
,
Posada
could
not
be
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
.
The
hope
may
be
that
Posada
can
soon
be
offered
to
a
post-Chavez
Allawi
-
like
puppet
in
Caracas
.
Whether
such
an
offer
were
accepted
or
declined
would
make
no
difference
;
justice
would
not
be
served
then
.
But
Posada
's
nearly
80
years
old
,
and
the
Venezuelan
people
will
ensure
that
's
a
vain
hope
.
So
instead
Posada
may
be
held
indefinitely
,
in
comfortable
custody
.
An
embarrassment
to
the
US
still
,
just
not
as
embarrassing
as
having
the
old
killer
strut
about
Miami
,
gloating
in
his
freedom
.
Meiring
is
more
than
an
embarrassment
.
His
case
threatens
the
consensus
fiction
of
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
So
his
name
will
remain
unspoken
.
Another
connection
to
Philippine
terror
and
weapons
smuggling
-
dating
from
the
1980s
-
is
alleged
in
the
book
Disposable
Patriot
,
by
Jack
Terrell
.
Terrell
,
a
CIA
asset
originally
recruited
for
the
Contra
effort
,
identifies
the
man
attempting
to
recruit
him
into
the
Philippine
scheme
as
Oliver
North
...
I
seem
to
recall
the
object
was
to
smuggle
explosives
.
http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939
I
've
read
the
book
-
it
's
a
first
person
memoir
with
the
ring
of
truth
,
especially
since
so
much
of
the
wider
context
has
confirmed
the
allegations
of
Contra
drug
connections
that
led
to
Terrell
becoming
a
target
for
discrediting
by
the
TWIG
counterintelligence
group
that
ran
interference
for
the
Contra
effort
,
staffed
by
covert
ops
types
including
Ollie
North
,
Robert
Owen
,
Vince
Cannistaro
and
Buck
Revell
.
Peter
Dale
Scott
includes
an
account
of
how
Terrell
's
whistleblowing
was
stifled
by
them
in
his
book
Cocaine
Politics
.

Due
to
the
Judge
in
the
1983
case
ruling
that
a
CIA
agent
could
not
testify
using
a
pseudonym
,
therefore
opening
him
to
cross-examination
by
Wilson
,
the
prosecution
had
a
problem
.
They
needed
someone
that
could
convince
the
jury
they
had
been
able
to
see
all
relevant
documents
in
CIA
files
on
Wilson
.
Wilson
was
claiming
that
he
had
been
working
for
the
CIA
when
he
sold
the
C
-
4
to
Quaddaffi
.
The
prosecution
was
charging
he
was
a
rogue
using
his
contacts
from
former
service
in
both
CIA
and
the
'
Office
of
Naval
Intelligence
'
.
Wilson
had
been
able
to
show
that
he
'd
had
more
than
80
"
non-social
contacts
"
with
the
CIA
since
his
retirement
in
1971
,
leaving
the
prosecution
's
case
in
turmoil
.
Then
Charles
A.
Briggs
came
to
the
rescue
.
Third
ranking
CIA
officer
,
Briggs
signed
a
declaration
on
February
3rd
,
1983
,
that
on
November
8th
,
1982
,
he
had
authorized
a
search
of
CIA
records
"
for
any
material
that
in
any
way
pertains
to
Edwin
P.
Wilson
,
or
the
various
allegations
concerning
his
activities
after
February
28th
,
1971
,
when
he
retired
from
the
CIA
.
"
The
Briggs
Declaration
states
that
with
one
exception
in
1972
,
Wilson
did
not
work
"
directly
or
indirectly
"
for
the
CIA
since
retiring
.

,
Federal
District
Judge
Lynn
Hughes
in
Huston
,

,
threw
out
Wilson
's
two
-

As
the
implications
of
the
Andaman
Islands
situation
sink
in
,
Indian
intelligence
has
inevitably
come
under
scrutiny
.
In
recent
months
,
its
fallibility
has
become
evident
.
The
inability
to
foresee
in
advance
the
assassination
attempt
on
the
pro-India
political
leader
and
former
Bangladeshi
prime
minister
Sheikh
Hasina
Wazed
last
August
21
at
a
political
rally
in
Dhaka
,
and
the
recent
"
coup
"
by
Nepalese
King
Gyanendra
dismissing
his
government
and
imposing
a
virtual
absolute
monarchy
,
are
glaring
examples
of
intelligence
failure

Trouble
on
India
's
islands
Ramtanu
Maitra
In
early
February
,
India
charged
34
Arakan
separatists
from
Myanmar
with
hiding
in
the
Landfall
Islands
,
part
of
the
Andaman
Islands
group
(
see
end
note
)
.
These
alleged
members
of
the
Arakan
Army
,
the
military
wing
of
the
National
Unity
Party
in
Myanmar
,
have
been
charged
with
illegal
entry
.
It
is
likely
,
but
not
certain
,
that
they
will
be
deported
to
Myanmar
.
But
the
news
of
the
Arakan
rebels
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
when
it
comes
to
growing
concern
in
New
Delhi
over
the
security
of
the
Andaman
Islands
.
Reports
are
circulating
in
the
intelligence
community
that
the
Andaman
Islands
are
not
only
thick
with
Myanmar
rebels
.
It
has
also
become
an
arms
depot
of
the
Liberation
Tigers
of
Tamil
Eelam
(
LTTE
)
,
who
operate
almost
freely
in
the
Andaman
Sea
.
Information
pointing
in
this
direction
came
to
light
after
the
December
26
tsunami
,
which
took
a
heavy
toll
on
the
Andamans
.
Correspondents
who
flocked
in
to
cover
the
tsunami
found
they
also
had
another
story
-
the
miserable
security
situation
surrounding
the
Indian
navy
's
Far
Eastern
Naval
Command
,
now
being
established
along
with
India
's
"
blue
water
navy
"
.
Deteriorating
security
Security
problems
in
the
Andaman
Sea
are
not
new
,
but
they
have
deteriorated
during
the
past
few
years
,
in
tandem
with
a
deterioration
in
the
security
situation
in
Bangladesh
,
Nepal
and
Bhutan
,
and
particularly
in
the
northeastern
Indian
states
of
Manipur
,
Nagaland
and
Tripura
.
While
the
Indian
army
has
become
rock
-
solid
in
the
western
front
,
and
has
developed
the
capability
of
withstanding
any
Pakistani
adventure
in
that
sector
,
it
has
become
highly
vulnerable
in
its
eastern
sector
,
where
its
enemy
is
not
a
national
army
but
a
multitude
of
secessionist
,
terrorist
and
drug
-
running
militants
operating
between
Southeast
Asia
and
northeastern
India
through
Bangladesh
.
The
Andaman
Sea
is
a
major
conduit
for
this
traffic
,
and
the
572
large
and
small
islands
that
constitute
the
Andaman
and
Nicobar
group
are
a
natural
transit
base
.
The
drugs
and
arms
travel
in
all
directions
.
Since
the
"
Sea
Tigers
"
of
the
LTTE
,
better
known
as
the
Tamil
Tigers
,
are
the
ones
who
rule
the
Andaman
Sea
:
they
carry
the
arms
and
drugs
for
their
own
use
and
also
to
deliver
to
rebels
in
Aceh
and
all
along
the
east
coast
of
Africa
.
It
is
old
news
that
the
Tamil
Tigers
have
developed
a
strong
network
within
South
Africa
.
This
is
not
unknown
to
New
Delhi
.
A
recent
report
by
a
journalist
from
Port
Blair
,
in
the
Andamans
,
quoted
an
unnamed
official
saying
that
foreigners
from
Myanmar
,
Bangladesh
and
Sri
Lanka
have
permanently
settled
in
the
islands
,
using
fake
Indian
ration
cards
,
while
citizens
of
Thailand
,
China
,
Indonesia
and
Malaysia
have
migrated
temporarily
to
plunder
the
natural
resources
and
leave
.
Port
Blair
,
Havelock
Islands
,
Diglipur
,
Middle
Nicobar
,
Campbell
's
Bay
,
Neil
Islands
and
Rangott
are
mostly
overrun
by
foreigners
,
he
said
.
An
official
estimate
issued
in
2003
suggests
there
are
50,000
"
foreigners
"
in
the
Andaman
Islands
,
but
unofficial
figures
are
much
higher
than
this
.
A
large
number
of
them
are
Bangladeshis
,
who
like
millions
of
their
countrymen
have
left
their
densely
populated
homeland
to
settle
elsewhere
.
As
most
of
them
have
few
technical
skills
,
and
the
Andamans
have
little
demand
for
them
in
any
case
,
they
turn
to
smuggling
and
other
unlawful
activities
.
The
presence
of
the
Sea
Tigers
in
the
area
with
guns
,
cash
and
drugs
makes
the
situation
extremely
dangerous
.
Reports
from
Port
Blair
make
it
evident
that
New
Delhi
gets
little
on
-
the
-
ground
intelligence
,
and
the
Indian
Coast
Guard
is
grossly
unequipped
to
deal
with
the
surge
of
illegal
migrants
to
the
islands
.
One
unnamed
naval
officer
was
quoted
saying
,
"
Arms
smuggling
is
a
very
profitable
business
in
this
region
.
"
Considering
the
islands
'
huge
strategic
importance
,
it
is
amazing
how
lax
New
Delhi
has
been
.
These
islands
sit
aside
the
vital
sea
lanes
of
the
Strait
of
Malacca
,
through
which
300
tankers
and
merchant
ships
pass
daily
,
bringing
in
oil
for
the
Far
East
and
Southeast
Asia
.
Intelligence
lapses
As
the
implications
of
the
Andaman
Islands
situation
sink
in
,
Indian
intelligence
has
inevitably
come
under
scrutiny
.
In
recent
months
,
its
fallibility
has
become
evident
.
The
inability
to
foresee
in
advance
the
assassination
attempt
on
the
pro-India
political
leader
and
former
Bangladeshi
prime
minister
Sheikh
Hasina
Wazed
last
August
21
at
a
political
rally
in
Dhaka
,
and
the
recent
"
coup
"
by
Nepalese
King
Gyanendra
dismissing
his
government
and
imposing
a
virtual
absolute
monarchy
,
are
glaring
examples
of
intelligence
failure
.
With
growing
economic
and
military
power
,
India
will
be
dependent
on
smaller
nations
in
the
region
increasingly
to
maintain
regional
security
.
Unless
New
Delhi
does
better
in
providing
security
to
its
own
nationals
against
rebels
,
secessionists
,
drug
runners
and
arms
traffickers
,
it
will
not
generate
much
confidence
in
the
capitals
of
surrounding
nations
.
In
fact
,
it
would
tend
to
encourage
more
organized
anti-India
outfits
,
such
as
the
Pakistani
Inter-
Services
Intelligence
(
ISI
)
and
outside
-
linked
Maoists
,
to
exploit
these
networks
and
weaken
India
's
eastern
flank
.
Indian
intelligence
's
lackluster
performance
in
dealing
with
the
LTTE
is
startling
.
This
formidable
enemy
,
which
gave
the
Indian
army
a
black
eye
in
the
mid-1980s
,
has
been
operating
in
northeastern
India
and
in
the
Andaman
Sea
for
a
long
time
.
In
2001
,
according
to
Indian
army
officials
,
security
forces
launched
a
wide
-
ranging
operation
in
the
300
-
some
inhabited
islands
neighboring
Andaman
and
Nicobar
,
and
found
huge
caches
of
arms
.
The
arms
were
said
to
belong
to
the
LTTE
and
"
other
terrorist
groups
"
.
The
search
-
and
-
destroy
operation
was
carried
out
by
the
Indian
government
after
repeated
requests
from
Colombo
.
In
addition
,
LTTE
activity
in
the
Andaman
Sea
is
well
known
to
local
observers
.
The
biggest
LTTE
maritime
disaster
was
reported
in
the
now
-
defunct
Asiaweek
in
2001
.
A
shipment
of
weapons
,
ammunition
and
explosives
,
believed
to
have
been
purchased
from
Cambodia
and
worth
several
million
dollars
,
left
the
port
of
Phuket
in
Thailand
in
early
February
2001
aboard
the
freighter
Comex
-
Joux
3
.
As
is
LTTE
standard
procedure
,
the
vessel
changed
its
name
at
sea
to
Horizon
.
On
its
journey
across
the
Bay
of
Bengal
the
freighter
was
tracked
by
the
Indian
navy
and
Orissa
-
based
spy
planes
of
India
's
Aviation
Research
Center
;
it
was
intercepted
by
Indian
naval
vessels
off
Sri
Lanka
's
east
coast
.
LTTE
arms
-
running
In
1997
,
the
Thai
navy
reported
the
interception
of
a
16
-
meter
boat
after
a
chase
off
the
Thai
port
of
Ranong
,
and
the
confiscation
of
two
tons
of
weapons
and
ammunition
.
Among
the
weapons
intercepted
were
two
rocket
-
propelled
-
grenade
launchers
,
20
assault
rifles
,
M
-
79
grenade
launchers
and
more
than
10,000
rounds
of
ammunition
.
Four
persons
were
arrested
,
reportedly
belonging
to
the
Manipur
Revolutionary
People
's
Front
.
Six
crew
members
were
from
the
Arakan
region
of
Myanmar
.
The
boat
was
heading
toward
Cox
's
Bazar
in
Bangladesh
.
Until
1995
the
LTTE
maintained
a
base
at
Twante
,
an
island
off
the
coat
of
Myanmar
,
west
of
the
Andaman
islands
.
Subsequently
,
Phuket
became
the
LTTE
's
main
backup
base
.
A
Sri
Lanka
-
born
Tamil
with
a
Norwegian
passport
was
arrested
by
Thai
authorities
in
2000
for
his
links
with
the
LTTE
.
At
the
time
of
his
arrest
,
the
suspect
was
allegedly
involved
in
constructing
a
"
submarine
"
in
a
shipyard
on
the
island
of
Sirae
near
Phuket
on
the
Andaman
Sea
coast
.
Steady
buildup
The
real
threat
to
the
Andaman
Islands
is
the
steady
building
-
up
of
ports
and
conduits
that
serve
the
Tamil
Tigers
and
a
host
of
less
-
strong
militant
groups
.
Over
the
past
decade
,
Bangladesh
has
steadily
moved
into
a
state
of
lawlessness
.
A
number
of
extremist
groups
,
under
the
cover
of
the
Islamist
movement
,
have
become
active
in
drug
trafficking
,
gun
running
and
anti-Indian
activities
.
It
is
widely
acknowledged
that
the
Pakistani
ISI
has
nurtured
a
number
of
extremist
Islamist
groups
,
such
as
the
Harkat
-
ul
-
Jehad
-
al
-
Islami
,
in
the
port
city
of
Chittagong
,
and
put
a
number
of
secessionist
rebels
from
India
's
northeast
in
touch
with
this
terrorist
network
.
As
a
result
,
north
of
the
Andaman
Islands
,
Bangladeshi
coastal
areas
have
become
a
nest
of
terrorists
involved
in
the
shipment
of
drugs
and
arms
.
A
pattern
of
arrests
and
seizures
indicate
that
arms
are
brought
by
the
LTTE
from
Laos
,
Cambodia
and
Thailand
into
Chittagong
,
from
where
they
are
transported
northward
by
land
to
Bhutan
.
The
route
from
Kalikhola
in
Bhutan
to
Cox
's
Bazar
passes
through
northern
Bengal
,
Assam
and
Meghalaya
,
and
on
into
Chittagong
.

“

’’
says
a

]
Karzai
,
Musharraf
new
regional
equations
KABUL
:
For
the
past
25
years
landlocked
Afghanistan
has
suffered
from
constant
interference
from
its
neighbours
-
Pakistan
,
Iran
and
the
Central
Asian
Republics
-
and
regional
powers
-
Russia
and
India
.
The
neighbours
are
still
interfering
,
but
there
are
signs
that
rather
than
undermining
Afghanistan
’s
stability
they
may
now
be
trying
to
strengthen
it
.
“
The
elections
should
be
a
reassurance
to
all
our
neighbours
that
a
stable
Afghanistan
,
a
peaceful
Afghanistan
is
good
for
all
.
Nobody
should
feel
a
looser
in
Afghanistan
,
’’
President
Hamid
Karzai
told
Pakistan
’s
English
daily
The
Nation
.
All
the
regional
countries
have
publicly
backed
the
Karzai
government
and
supported
the
electoral
process
,
but
serious
undercurrents
remain
as
they
all
have
their
favourite
contenders
in
Afghanistan
.
Since
September
11
,
Pakistan
has
been
repeatedly
accused
by
Afghan
and
Western
leaders
of
harbouring
Taliban
extremists
who
had
pledged
to
disrupt
the
elections
,
but
at
the
highest
level
the
US
has
avoided
criticising
President
Pervaiz
Musharraf
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
helping
the
US
catch
Al
Qaeda
elements
inside
Pakistan
.
That
changed
on
September
22
when
President
George
W.
Bush
,
Musharraf
and
Karzai
held
a
three
way
meeting
in
New
York
on
the
sidelines
of
the
UN
General
Assembly
.
The
meeting
was
pushed
together
by
the
CIA
and
the
US
Defence
Department
who
were
desperately
anxious
to
secure
a
peaceful
election
in
Afghanistan
and
the
non-interference
of
alleged
Pakistani
backed
Taliban
.
Western
and
Afghan
diplomats
intimately
involved
with
the
meeting
,
said
Bush
pushed
Musharraf
hard
on
reigning
in
the
Taliban
so
the
elections
could
take
place
peacefully
.
‘’
Where
are
Mullah
Omar
,
Mullah
Usmani
and
Gulbuddin
Hikmetar
?
’’
Bush
is
reported
to
have
asked
a
flustered
Musharraf
.
All
three
are
extremist
Taliban
or
their
allies
and
known
to
be
living
in
Pakistan
.
(
Mullah
Omar
is
leader
of
the
Taliban
,
Usmani
is
the
former
corps
commander
of
Kandahar
under
the
Taliban
regime
and
now
a
commander
of
Taliban
forces
while
Hikmetyar
heads
the
extremist
Hizb
-
e
-
Islami
.
)
‘’
It
was
the
first
time
that
Bush
totally
focused
on
the
Taliban
threat
rather
than
Al
Qaeda
with
the
Pakistanis
,
’’
says
a
Western
diplomat
.
‘’
Bush
was
very
well
briefed
before
the
meeting
,
’’
the
diplomat
said
.
An
Afghan
official
at
the
meeting
added
,
‘’
The
Americans
now
realise
that
the
Taliban
are
a
bigger
threat
to
our
security
than
Al
Qaeda
.
’’
Karzai
was
clearly
pleased
at
the
results
.
‘’
President
Musharraf
promised
to
help
us
and
cooperate
with
us
on
curbing
terrorist
activity
by
the
Taliban
,
’’
says
Karzai
.
The
next
day
an
angry
Musharraf
categorically
said
that
Pakistan
would
not
send
Pakistani
troops
to
Iraq
,
a
clear
snub
to
the
Americans
.
Until
then
he
had
said
Pakistan
’s
options
were
open
.
However
Pakistani
officials
insist
that
the
decision
was
unconnected
to
the
tripartite
meeting
.
US
and
NATO
military
officers
in
Kabul
say
it
is
too
early
to
say
whether
Bush
’s
tough
message
was
instrumental
in
persuading
Musharraf
and
the
ISI
to
pressure
the
Taliban
to
restrain
from
disrupting
the
elections
.
However
there
were
visible
signs
of
a
crackdown
on
the
Pakistan
side
.
‘’
Pakistan
now
has
a
large
force
deployed
in
Baluchistan
which
was
not
there
before
,
’’
says
Lt.
General
David
Barno
.
‘’
There
is
much
better
tactical
cooperation
between
our
forces
on
both
sides
of
the
border
,
but
the
movement
of
Taliban
still
goes
on
both
ways
,
’’
he
adds
.
Also
several
days
before
the
elections
Pakistan
closed
the
border
crossing
point
at
Chaman
in
Baluchistan
which
is
a
key
entry
point
for
the
Taliban
into
Afghanistan
.
However
US
military
officers
say
regular
army
officers
-
many
of
them
Pashtun
-
leading
units
of
the
Frontier
Corps
who
are
on
the
border
remain
deeply
sympathetic
to
the
Taliban
and
the
mullahs
of
the
JUI
.
At
the
same
time
the
US
remains
oblivious
of
the
serious
problems
and
political
fallout
which
the
army
is
facing
in
its
operations
in
Waziristan
.
Not
only
is
the
army
facing
serious
political
fallout
,
growing
anti-Americanism
and
anti-army
feeling
in
the
tribal
areas
but
it
is
also
taking
heavy
casualties
-
between
400
-
500
Pakistani
soldiers
have
been
killed
in
the
region
since
March
.
Musharraf
has
always
maintained
that
the
US
has
never
provided
actionable
intelligence
about
Taliban
leaders
hiding
in
Baluchistan
.
That
too
may
change
.
US
and
Afghan
intelligence
will
shortly
be
presenting
the
ISI
with
a
list
of
Taliban
extremists
and
their
suspected
whereabouts
.
Moreover
there
are
now
major
covert
attempts
under
way
to
try
and
bring
back
to
Kabul
leading
Taliban
commanders
,
who
have
been
living
quietly
in
Pakistan
and
have
taken
no
part
in
the
Taliban
insurgency
.
With
the
Taliban
failure
to
disrupt
the
Afghan
elections
,
the
militants
are
even
more
isolated
from
the
mainstream
Taliban
who
want
to
return
home
.
Until
now
Pakistan
has
not
facilitated
such
a
return
and
clearly
it
can
not
happen
until
there
is
both
a
pull
from
Kabul
and
a
push
from
Islamabad
.
With
President
Karzai
certain
to
win
the
elections
and
the
demotion
of
key
former
Northern
Alliance
figures
such
as
General
Fahim
and
warlord
Ismail
Khan
,
there
is
now
little
reason
for
moderate
Taliban
leaders
to
fear
reprisals
from
former
Northern
Alliance
figures
if
they
return
home
.
Their
removal
should
also
provide
increased
motivation
for
Pakistan
to
help
the
return
of
moderate
Taliban
.
Afghan
officials
welcomed
the
appointment
on
October
3
of
Lt.
General
Ashfaq
Kiyani
as
the
new
ISI
chief
.
Kayani
is
well
known
and
liked
in
Kabul
as
during
the
last
year

led
the
Pakistani
delegation
in
the
tripartite
military
meetings
with
the
Afghan
and
US
military
on
issues
related
to
border
issues
.
Karzai
also
has
to
deal
with
the
stepped
up
rivalry
between
India
and
Pakistan
in
Afghanistan
.
Islamabad
accuses
New
Delhi
of
using
its
consulates

and
Jalalabad
to
train
Balochi
insurgents
who
are
active
in

“

’’
says

.

and
Afghanistan
deny

claim
.
‘’

says

Karzai
categorically
said
that
he
has
assured
Musharraf
repeatedly
that
any
adverse
action
against
Pakistan
taken
by
Indian
diplomats
inside
Afghanistan
would
be
acted
upon
swiftly
.
Senior
US

have
warned
India
also
.

shift

strengthened
position

Russia
and
India
which
have
traditionally
backed
the
Tajik
dominated
former
Northern
Alliance
made
strenuous
efforts
to
convince
presidential
candidate
Younis
Qanooni
to
strike
a
deal
with
Karzai
before
the
elections
and
not
to
oppose
Karzai
.
Iran
in
particular
feared
that
Qanooni
would
loose
and
then
be
politically
isolated
from
the
mainstream
.
Qanooni
refused
to
accept
the
Iranian
advice
as
his
fellow
Panjsheri
Tajiks
urged
him
to
stand
against
Karzai
.
However
since
the
elections
Iranian
influence
has
proved
critical
in
convincing
the
Hazara
Shia
candidate
Mohammed
Mohaqeq
to
accept
the
results
of
the
elections
and
later
convincing
Qanooni
to
do
the
same
.
With
the
US
military
presence
posing
a
threat
on
their
borders
in
both
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
Iran
’s
moderate
leadership
is
keen
to
help
stabilise
Karzai
so
that
the
US
presence
in
Afghanistan
is
reduced
.
However
powerful
hardliners
in
Tehran
may
be
trying
to
undermine
that
strategy
and
a
new
issue
is
likely
to
deepen
the
rift
with
the
moderates
.
Iranian
officials
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
US
occupation
of
Shindand
,
a
massive
Soviet
-
era
airbase
just
30
kilometres
from
Iran
’s
border
.
The
enhanced
US
presence
in
western
Afghanistan
was
only
made
possible
after
the
ousting
of
Ismail
Khan
,
the
warlord
and
Governor
of
Herat
province
last
month
,
who
was
a
close
ally
of
Iranian
hardliners
.
Iranian
officials
say
they
made
no
objections
to
Khan
’s
ouster
because
they
want
to
strengthen
Karzai
’s
campaign
against
warlords
.
At
a
time
of
heightened
tensions
between
Tehran
and
Washington
over
Iran
’s
nuclear
weapons
program
and
calls
by
neo-conservatives
in
Washington
that
a
second
Bush
term
should
deal
with
Iran
aggressively
,
the
Iranians
fear
that
Shindand
could
be
used
as
a
listening
post
,
spying
facility
and
even
a
launching
pad
for
any
future
US
actions
against
Iran
.
Afghan
officials
say
the
Americans
have
moved
over
100
Special
Forces
and
helicopters
to
Shindand
.
However
General
Barno
insists
the
US
presence
poses
no
threat
to
Iran
.
‘’
We
have
a
very
small
number
of
forces
in
Shindand
with
a
few
helicopters
,
’’
says
Barno
.
Nevertheless
this
places
Karzai
in
a
difficult
and
sensitive
situation
because
he
has
to
maintain
excellent
relations
with
both
the
US
and
Iran
.
‘’
Afghanistan
has
had
the
benefit
of
cooperation
from
both
the
US
and
Iran
.
So
far
what
they
have
done
together
has
been
good
for
us
and
that
’s
how
we
would
like
to
keep
it
’’
,
says
Karzai
.
Nobody
can
claim
that
the
interference
of
Afghanistan
’s
neighbours
is
over
,
but
the
elections
will
do
much
to
strengthen
Karzai
and
deal
more
firmly
with
neighbours
’
interference
.
In
the
post
election
scenario
it
is
becoming
abundantly
clear
that
the
Taliban
do
not
have
the
support
of
the
Afghan
people
nor
the
Afghan
Pashtuns
.
In
a
highly
significant
move
Afghan
Pashtun
tribes
along
the
Pakistan
border
warned
the
Taliban
in
Quetta
and
Chaman
that
if
they
try
and
disrupt
the
elections
,
they
would
be
resisted
.
Many
Taliban
living
in
Afghanistan
voted
for
President
Karzai
.
It
is
now
abundantly
clear
that
with
the
rapidly
changing
face
of
Afghanistan
,
the
demise
of
key
Northern
Alliance
figures
and
the
fluid
political
situation
in
Afghanistan
,
Pakistan
should
reconsider
its
policy
of
giving
unlimited
sanctuary
to
Taliban
extremists
living
on
Pakistani
soil
.

The
debate
that
a
handful
of
Texas
multi-millionnaires
close
to
the
Bush
family
have
cleverly
manufactured
over
John
Kerry
's
war
record
is
absurd
in
every
way
.
The
charges
that
they
have
put
some
vets
up
to
making
against
Kerry
are
false
and
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
historical
record
to
be
false
.
Most
of
those
making
the
charges
have
even
flip
-
flopped
,
contradicting
themselves
.
Or
they
were
n't
eyewitnesses
and
are
just
lying
.
But
to
address
the
substance
of
this
Big
Lie
is
to
risk
falling
into
its
logic
.
The
true
absurdity
of
the
entire
situation
is
easily
appreciated
when
we
consider
that
George
W.
Bush
never
showed
any
bravery
at
all
at
any
point
in
his
life
.
He
has
never
lived
in
a
war
zone
.
If
some
of
John
Kerry
's
wounds
were
superficial
,
Bush
received
no
wounds
.
(
And
,
a
piece
of
shrapnel
in
the
forearm
that
caused
only
a
minor
wound
would
have
killed
had
it
hit
an
eye
and
gone
into
the
brain
;
the
shrapnel
being
in
your
body
demonstrates
you
were
in
mortal
danger
and
did
n't
absent
yourself
from
it
.
That
is
the
logic
of
the
medal
)
.
Kerry
saved
a
man
's
life
while
under
fire
.
Bush
did
no
such
thing
.
What
was
Bush
doing
with
his
youth
?
He
was
drinking
.
He
was
drinking
like
a
fish
,
every
night
,
into
the
wee
hours
.
For
decades
.
He
gave
no
service
to
anyone
,
risked
nothing
,
and
did
not
even
slack
off
efficiently
.
The
history
of
alcoholism
and
possibly
other
drug
use
is
a
key
issue
because
it
not
only
speaks
to
Bush
's
character
as
an
addictive
personality
,
but
may
tell
us
something
about
his
erratic
and
alarming
actions
as
president
.
His
explosive
temper
probably
provoked
the
disastrous
siege
of
Fallujah
last
spring
,
killing
600
Iraqis
,
most
of
them
women
and
children
,
in
revenge
for
the
deaths
of
4
civilian
mercenaries
,
one
of
them
a
South
African
.
(
Newsweek
reported
that
Bush
commanded
his
cabinet
,
"
Let
heads
roll
!
"
)
That
temper
is
only
one
problem
.
Bush
has
a
sadistic
streak
.
He
clearly
enjoyed
,
as
governor
,
watching
executions
.
His
delight
in
killing
people
became
a
campaign
issue
in
2000
when
he
seemed
,
in
one
debate
,
to
enjoy
the
prospect
of
executing
wrong
-
doers
a
little
too
much
.
He
has
clearly
gone
on
enjoying
killing
people
on
a
large
scale
in
Iraq
.
Drug
abuse
can
affect
the
ability
of
the
person
to
feel
deep
emotions
like
empathy
.
Two
decades
of
pickling
his
nervous
system
in
various
highly
toxic
substances
have
left
Bush
damaged
goods
.
Even
for
those
who
later
abstain
,
"
visual
-
spatial
abilities
,
abstraction
,
problem
solving
,
and
short
-
term
memory
,
are
the
slowest
to
recover
.
"
That
he
managed
to
get
on
the
wagon
(
though
with
that
pretzel
incident
,
you
wonder
how
firmly
)
is
laudable
.
But
he
suffers
the
severe
effects
of
the
aftermath
,
and
we
are
all
suffering
along
with
him
now
,
since
he
is
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
.
We
all
know
by
now
that
Bush
did
not
even
do
his
full
service
with
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
,
absenting
himself
to
work
on
the
Alabama
senate
campaign
of
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.
Whether
he
was
actually
AWOL
during
this
stint
is
unclear
.
But
it
is
clear
that
not
only
did
Bush
slack
off
on
his
National
Guard
service
,
but
he
slacked
off
from
his
campaign
work
.
This
little
-
noted
interview
with
Blount
's
nephew
Murph
Archibald
,
which
appeared
on
National
Public
Radio
's
"
All
Things
Considered
on
March
30
,
2004
,
gives
a
devastating
insight
into
what
it
was
like
to
have
to
suffer
through
Bush
in
that
period
.
This
campaign
season
,
there
have
been
questions
about
whether
George
W.
Bush
fulfilled
his
obligations
to
the
National
Guard
as
a
young
lieutenant
in
the
early
1970s
.
For
weeks
,
reporters
scoured
Alabama
in
search
of
pilots
or
anyone
who
might
have
remembered
seeing
Mr.
Bush
at
the
time
he
was
serving
in
the
National
Guard
there
.
There
is
one
place
in
Alabama
where
Mr.
Bush
was
present
nearly
every
day
:
the
headquarters
in
Montgomery
of
US
Senate
candidate
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.
President
Bush
has
always
said
that
working
for
Blount
was
the
reason
he
transferred
to
the
Alabama
Air
National
Guard
.
NPR
's
Wade
Goodwyn
has
this
report
about
Mr.
Bush
's
time
on
that
campaign
.
WADE
GOODWYN
reporting
:
In
1972
,
Baba
Groom
was
a
smart
,
funny
young
woman
smack
-
dab
in
the
middle
of
an
exciting
US
Senate
campaign
.
Groom
was
Republican
Red
Blount
's
scheduler
,
and
in
that
job
,
she
was
the
hub
in
the
campaign
wheel
.
Ask
her
about
the
handsome
young
man
from
Texas
,
and
she
remembers
him
32
years
later
like
it
was
yesterday
.
Ms.
BABA
GROOM
(
Former
Campaign
Worker
)
:
He
would
wear
khaki
trousers
and
some
old
jacket
.
He
was
always
ready
to
go
out
on
the
road
.
On
the
phone
,
you
could
hear
his
accent
.
It
was
a
Texas
accent
.
But
he
just
melded
with
everybody
.
GOODWYN
:
The
candidate
Mr.
Bush
was
working
for
,
Red
Blount
,
had
gotten
rich
in
Alabama
in
the
construction
business
.
Prominent
Southern
Republicans
were
something
of
a
rare
breed
in
those
days
.
Blount
's
support
of
the
party
led
him
to
be
appointed
Richard
Nixon
's
postmaster
general
.
In
Washington
,
Blount
became
friends
and
tennis
partners
with
Mr.
Bush
's
father
,
then
Congressman
Bush
.
That
was
how
26
-
year
-
old
Lieutenant
Bush
came
to
Montgomery
,
at
his
father
's
urging
.
.
.
It
was
Mr.
Bush
's
job
to
organize
the
Republican
county
chairpersons
in
the
67
Alabama
counties
.
Back
in
1972
in
the
Deep
South
,
many
rural
counties
did
n't
have
much
in
the
way
of
official
Republican
Party
apparatus
.
But
throughout
Alabama
,
there
were
Republicans
and
Democrats
who
wanted
to
help
Red
Blount
.
It
was
the
young
Texan
's
job
to
find
out
what
each
county
leader
needed
in
the
way
of
campaign
supplies
and
get
those
supplies
to
them
.
Groom
says
this
job
helped
Mr.
Bush
understand
how
even
in
a
statewide
Senate
campaign
,
politics
are
local
.
.
.
.
Murph
Archibald
is
Red
Blount
's
nephew
by
marriage
,
and
in
1972
,
he
was
coming
off
a
15
-
month
tour
in
Vietnam
in
the
infantry
.
Archibald
says
that
in
a
campaign
full
of
dedicated
workers
,
Mr.
Bush
was
not
one
of
them
.
Mr.
MURPH
ARCHIBALD
(
Nephew
of
Red
Blount
)
:
Well
,
I
was
coming
in
early
in
the
morning
and
leaving
in
mid-evenings
.
Ordinarily
,
George
would
come
in
around
noon
;
he
would
ordinarily
leave
around
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
evening
.
GOODWYN
:
Archibald
says
that
two
months
before
the
election
,
in
September
of
'72
,
Red
Blount
's
campaign
manager
came
to
him
and
asked
that
he
quietly
take
over
Mr.
Bush
's
job
because
the
campaign
materials
were
not
getting
out
to
the
counties
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
certainly
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
concerns
about
my
taking
over
this
work
with
the
campaign
workers
there
.
My
overall
impression
was
that
he
did
n't
seem
as
interested
in
the
campaign
as
the
other
people
who
were
working
at
the
state
headquarters
.
GOODWYN
:
Murph
Archibald
says
that
at
first
,
he
did
n't
know
that
Mr.
Bush
was
serving
in
the
Air
National
Guard
.
After
he
found
out
from
somebody
else
,
Archibald
attempted
to
talk
to
Mr.
Bush
about
it
.
The
president
was
a
lieutenant
and
Archibald
had
been
a
lieutenant
,
too
;
he
figured
they
had
something
to
talk
about
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
did
n't
have
any
interest
at
all
in
talking
about
the
military
.
In
fact
,
when
I
broached
the
subject
with
him
,
he
simply
changed
the
subject
.
He
was
n't
unpleasant
about
it
,
but
he
just
changed
the
subject
and
would
n't
talk
about
it
.
GOODWYN
:
Far
from
Texas
and
Washington
,
DC
,
Mr.
Bush
enjoyed
his
freedom
.
He
dated
a
beautiful
young
woman
working
on
the
campaign
.
He
went
out
in
the
evenings
and
had
a
good
time
.
In
fact
,
he
left
the
house
he
rented
in
such
disrepair
--
with
damage
to
the
walls
and
a
chandelier
destroyed
--
that
the
Montgomery
family
who
owned
it
still
grumble
about
the
unpaid
repair
bill
.
Archibald
says
Mr.
Bush
would
come
into
the
office
and
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
offer
up
stories
about
the
drinking
he
'd
done
the
night
before
,
kind
of
as
a
conversation
starter
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
People
have
different
ways
of
starting
the
days
in
any
office
.
They
're
going
to
talk
about
their
kids
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
football
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
the
weather
.
And
this
was
simply
his
opening
gambit
;
he
would
start
talking
about
that
he
had
been
out
late
the
night
before
drinking
.
GOODWYN
:
Archibald
says
the
frequency
with
which
Mr.
Bush
discussed
the
subject
was
off
-
putting
to
him
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
I
mean
,
at
that
time
,
I
was
28
;
George
would
have
been
25
or
26
.
And
I
thought
it
was
really
unusual
that
someone
in
their
mid-20s
would
initiate
conversations
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
something
as
serious
as
a
US
senatorial
campaign
,
by
talking
about
their
drinking
the
night
before
.
I
thought
it
unusual
and
,
frankly
,
inappropriate
.
GOODWYN
:
According
to
Archibald
,
Mr.
Bush
would
also
sometimes
tell
stories
about
his
days
at
Yale
in
New
Haven
,
and
how
whenever
he
got
pulled
over
for
erratic
driving
,
he
was
let
go
after
the
officers
discovered
he
was
the
grandson
of
a
Connecticut
US
senator
.
Archibald
,
a
middle
-
class
Alabama
boy
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
is
now
a
registered
Democrat
--
did
n't
like
that
story
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
He
told
us
whenever
he
was
stopped
,
as
soon
as
the
law
enforcement
found
out
that
he
was
the
grandson
of
Prescott
Bush
,
they
would
let
him
go
.
And
he
would
always
laugh
about
that
.
"
Goodwyn
dutifully
notes
that
Baba
Groom
did
n't
remember
George
telling
drunk
stories
.
But
that
means
nothing
,
since
they
were
n't
the
sort
of
things
guys
like
Bush
told
the
"
girls
"
.
He
was
trying
to
buddy
with
Archibald
and
impress
him
.
Again
,
decades
of
this
sort
of
behavior
do
not
leave
a
person
untouched
.
Our
world
is
in
crisis
and
our
Republic
is
in
danger
.
It
should
not
be
left
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
spent
his
life
like
this
.
When
the
cities
are
on
fire
with
the
burning
flesh
of
men
Just
remember
that
death
is
not
the
end
And
you
search
in
vain
to
find
just
one
law
abiding
citizen
Just
remember
that
death
is
not
the
end

Afraid
I
do
n't
have
time
today
to
discuss
these
,
but
some
stories
need
attention
:
From
Wednesday
's
Mirror
the
headline
,
"
Have
200,000
AK47s
Fallen
Into
the
Hands
of
Iraq
Terrorists
?
"
(
also
see
this
thread
on
the
RI
discussion
board
)
:
Some
200,000
guns
the
US
sent
to
Iraqi
security
forces
may
have
been
smuggled
to
terrorists
,
it
was
feared
yesterday

The
99
-
tonne
cache
of
AK47s
was
to
have
been
secretly
flown
out
from
a
US
base
in
Bosnia
.
But
the
four
planeloads
of
arms
have
vanished
.
Orders
for
the
deal
to
go
ahead
were
given
by
the
US
Department
of
Defense
.
But
the
work
was
contracted
out
via
a
complex
web
of
private
arms
traders
.
And
the
Moldovan
airline
used
to
transport
the
shipment
was
blasted
by
the
UN
in
2003
for
smuggling
arms
to
Liberia
,
human
rights
group
Amnesty
has
discovered
.
It
follows
a
separate
probe
claiming
that
thousands
of
guns
meant
for
Iraq
's
police
and
army
instead
went
to
al
-
Qaeda
.
Amnesty
chief
spokesman
Mike
Blakemore
said
:
"
It
's
unbelievable
that
no
one
can
account
for
200,000
assault
rifles
.
If
these
weapons
have
gone
missing
it
's
a
terrifying
prospect
.
"
American
defence
chiefs
hired
a
US
firm
to
take
the
guns
,
from
the
90s
Bosnian
war
,
to
Iraq
.
But
air
traffic
controllers
in
Baghdad
have
no
record
of
the
flights
,
which
supposedly
took
off
between
July
2004
and
July
2005
.
A
coalition
forces
spokesman
confirmed
they
had
not
received
"
any
weapons
from
Bosnia
"
and
added
they
were
"
not
aware
of
any
purchases
for
Iraq
from
Bosnia
"
.
Nato
and
US
officials
have
already
voiced
fears
that
Bosnian
arms
-
sold
by
US
,
British
and
Swiss
firms
-
are
being
passed
to
insurgents
.
A
NATO
spokesman
said
:
"
There
's
no
tracking
mechanism
to
ensure
they
do
n't
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
.
There
are
concerns
that
some
may
have
been
siphoned
off
.
"
This
year
a
newspaper
claimed
two
UK
firms
were
involved
in
a
deal
in
which
thousands
of
guns
for
Iraqi
forces
were
re-routed
to
al
-
Qaeda
.
The
Moldovan
airline
is
Aerocom
,
and
yes
,
it
's
one
of
Victor
Bout
's
.
It
's
always
a
bang
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
,
reading
again
the
play
the
incompetence
theory
receives
,
even
from
some
of
the
Administration
's
harshest
mainstream
critics
.
But
then
,
even
to
talk
of
an
"
administration
"
may
be
misdirection
at
this
point
,
given
how
little
representative
government
means
in
the
United
States
these
days
,
and
how
much
of
"
national
security
"
has
been
privatized
into
a
global
gangland
of
drugs
and
guns
.
Like
the
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
that
have
been
"
lost
"
in
Iraq
,
planeloads
of
arms
do
n't
just
"
vanish
"
;
not
when
the
Pentagon
contracts
the
work
to
an
international
criminal
of
Bout
's
untouchable
stature
.
But
Bout
's
name
is
n't
likely
to
be
mentioned
in
whatever
coverage
this
story
receives
,
before
it
sinks
like
so
many
others
beneath
the
media
's
frothing
triviality
.
Meanwhile
,
a
decision
's
been
reached
in
the
trial
of
Toledo
priest
Gerald
Robinson
.
And
it
's
guilty
:
The
Rev.
Gerald
Robinson
appeared
stony
-
faced
as
the
jury
's
guilty
verdict
was
read
,
and
he
blinked
repeatedly
and
glanced
at
his
lawyers
before
being
led
away
in
handcuffs
.
...
The
crime
occurred
in
the
sacristy
adjoining
the
hospital
chapel
in
downtown
Toledo
on
the
Saturday
before
Easter
in
1980
.
Investigators
said
the
nun
,
Margaret
Ann
Pahl
,
71
,
was
strangled
and
then
stabbed
,
with
nine
wounds
on
her
chest
forming
the
shape
of
an
inverted
cross
,
a
well
-
recognized
Satanic
symbol
.
An
altar
cloth
was
draped
over
her
half
-
naked
body
,
which
was
posed
as
if
she
had
been
sexually
assaulted
.
It
was
about
how
he
could
humiliate
her
the
most
,
prosecutor
Dean
Mandros
said
in
closing
arguments
.
He
left
a
message
for
everyone
to
see
...
maybe
to
God
himself
.
After
the
sentencing
one
of
Robinson
's
tearful
supporters
"
turned
to
Claudia
Vercellotti
,
a
local
leader
of
the
Survivors
Network
for
Those
Abused
by
Priests
[
SNAP
]
,
who
had
helped
reopen
the
case
,
and
told
her
,
'
I
hope
you
rot
in
hell
!
'
"
From
SNAP
's
statement
on
the
Robinson
conviction
:
More
than
ever
,
police
and
prosecutors
have
the
tools
and
the
will
to
go
after
horrific
crimes
,
even
when
the
defendants
are
seemingly
powerful
individuals
or
institutions
.
When
victims
and
witnesses
stay
silent
,
nothing
changes
.
When
victims
and
witnesses
speak
up
,
at
least
sometimes
a
child
is
protected
,
the
truth
is
exposed
,
and
justice
is
done
.

Finally
,
from
an
email
,
a
follow
-
up
on
the
reopening
of
the
investigation
into
the
Atlanta
Child
Murders
:
Dekalb
County
Police
Chief
Louis
Graham
...
the
man
who
reopened
the
investigations
last
year
,
is
mysteriously
stepping
down
.
And
of
all
the
people
who
the
county
is
getting
to
find
a

is
none
other
than
Lee

,
the
original
supervisor
of
the
Atlanta

,
who
was
in

murders

CRACKDOWN
ON
POLYGAMY
GROUP
Small
polygamous
groups
have
existed
in
the
southwestern
US
under
the
watchful
yet
fairly
benign
eye
of
authorities
ever
since
a
sect
known
as
the
Fundamentalist
Latter
Day
Saints
(
FLDS
)
separated
itself
from
mainstream
Mormonism
in
1890
.
...
Now
,
FLDS
leader
Warren
Jeffs
has
been
added
to
the
FBI
's
list
of
"
Ten
Most
Wanted
Fugitives
,
"
a
move
that
caps
law
enforcement
's
dramatic
change
of
approach
toward
the
polygamous
group
in
recent
years
...
[
because
of
]
the
impact
that
the
group
's
practices
,
law
enforcement
officials
say
,
are
having
on
the
most
vulnerable
within
the
sect
,
particularly
children
and
women
.
When
the
FLDS
under
Mr.
Jeffs
(
and
his
father
before
him
)
grew
to
some
10,000
followers
in
several
southwestern
communities
with
estimated
assets
of
$
110
million
;
when
it
became
clear
that
government
officials
,
school
authorities
,
and
police
in
those
communities
had
become
intertwined
with
the
sect
;
when
ex-members
increasingly
reported
child
and
sexual
abuse
charges
(
mainly
involving
underage
girls
forced
to
marry
older
men
)
;
and
when
the
sect
began
to
use
secluded
compounds
,
state
and
federal
authorities
started
to
crack
down
more
vigorously
.
...
Specifically
,
Jeffs
is
charged
in
Utah
and
Arizona
with
sexual
assault
of
underage
girls
and
with
arranging
"
spiritual
"
marriages
for
girls
and
older
men
.
At
weekend
press
conferences
in
Salt
Lake
City
and
Phoenix
,
FBI
and
state
officials
said
Jeffs
"
is
considered
armed
and
dangerous
and
may
be
traveling
with
armed
bodyguards
.
"
In
the
past
,
he
has
talked
in
apocalyptic
terms
about
a
violent
end
to
the
world
,
according
to
former
members
.
...
As
with
Christian
Identity
and
other
hate
-
related
philosophies
tied
to
the
Aryan
Nations
and
the
neo-Nazi
Creativity
Movement
,
Jeffs
has
preached
racism
as
well
.
The
black
race
is
the
people
through
which
the
devil
has
always
been
able
to
bring
evil
unto
the
earth
,
Jeffs
has
said
as
cited
by
the
Southern
Poverty
Law
Center
's
"
Intelligence
Report
.
"
An
editorial
in
the
church
-
owned
Deseret
Morning
News
in
Salt
Lake
City
earlier
this
year
acknowledged
that
"
the
state
's
history
,
a
conservative
belief
in
free
choice
,
and
an
unwillingness
to
stir
up
a
hornet
's
nest
in
the
national
media
have
likely
all
contributed
to
the
kid
-
glove
approach
lawmakers
and
law
-
enforcement
officers
have
taken
when
dealing
with
polygamous
communities
.

Maybe
I
'm
missing
something
here
,
but
how
,
exactly
,
does
one
'
Loose
'
200,000
AK47's
?
There
's
no
tracking
mechanism
in
place
?!?!?
Never
mind
.
No
need
to
worry
.
I
'm
sure
this
kind
of
thing
goes
on
all
the
time
.
We
now
return
you
to
your
regularly
scheduled
programming
....
just
go
here
,
it
s
simply
amazing
The
Raw
Story
i
count
like
14
explosive
headlines
.
Then
,
of
course
,
there
is
the
evidence
the
jury
did
not
hear
about
in
the
Robinson
case
...
Funny
how
some
things
are
squirelled
away
by
well
-
meaning
prosecutors
...
Maybe
because
they
hint
at
a
larger
conspiracy
/
network
of
abusers
/
satanic
underground
?
I
read
of
a
case
not
long
ago
when
some
people
were
trying
to
get
a
polygamous
judge
taken
off
the
bench
for
not
obeying
state
law
.
Of
course
law
enforcement
has
dragged
it's
feet
when
members
are
taking
part
in
the
activity
themselves
.
Personally
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
what
adults
do
to
one
another
as
long
as
there
is
no
abuse
invovled
.
It
is
the
marrying
off
of
young
girls
to
older
men
often
close
relatives
that
enfurates
me
.
Also
these
cults
have
multimillions
yet
the
women
and
kids
live
in
poverty
so
the
leaders
can
live
the
high
life
.
In
the
Warren
Jeffs
cult
he
reassigns
wives
if
the
husband
displeases
him
or
to
reward
the
new
husband
.
Husbands
marry
mothers
and
teen
daughters
at
the
same
time
.
a
rare
form
of
retardation
is
showing
up
in
that
group
more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
It
is
genetic
and
the
child
needs
to
get
the
gene
from
both
parents
to
turn
into
a
vegetable
instead
of
a
thinking
child
.
The
doctor
begs
them
to
stop
intermarrying
but
they
say
they
have
to
keep
the
blood
pure
.
look
up
fumarase
deficiency
for
more
info
.
Also
look
up
the
kingston
family
.
One
member
actually
was
convicted
of
beating
his
teen
daughter
unconcious
when
she
ran
away
from
'
marriage
'
to
her
father
's
own
brother
.
no
one
was
charged
for
forced
marriage
,
only
the
beating
.
So
we
"
lost
"
some
weapon
?
It
's
a
good
thing
too
.
We
would
n't
want
those
terrorists
to
run
out
of
shit
to
shoot
at
us
.
Then
the
war
might
stop
&
all
those
juicy
profits
would
just
evaporate
.
What
's
a
few
dead
soldiers
in
comparison
to
keeping
all
those
defense
contractors
awash
in
all
that
tax
cash
?
They
really
are
milking
the
incompetence
angle
though
,
are
n't
they
?
Just
another
big
Iraq
whoopsie
daisy
,
huh
?
Christ
,
you
'd
think
America
would
get
a
bit
tired
of
these
guys
treating
her
like
she
was
populated
with
nothing
but
gullible
idiots
.
I
suppose
that
it
's
damn
lucky
for
the
GOP
that
she
is
populated
with
gullible
idiots

A

the
leaders
it
has
,
my
friends
...
And
MEK
--
the
Iranian
(
not
Iraqi
)
terror
group
in
question
--
is
itself
unquestionably
a
cult
:
As
the
leaders
like
to
boast
,
the
Mujahedeen
is
a
family
affair
.
(
''
We
have
three
generations
of
martyrs
:
grandmothers
,
mothers
,
daughters
.
''
)
Most
of
the
girls
I
was
meeting
had
grown
up
in
Mujahedeen
schools
in
Ashraf
,
where
they
lived
separated
from
their
parents
.
Family
visits
were
allowed
on
Thursday
nights
and
Fridays
.
When
Iraq
invaded
Kuwait
,
many
of
these
girls
were
transported
to
Jordan
and
then
smuggled
to
various
countries
--
Germany
,
France
,
Canada
,
Denmark
,
England
,
the
United
States
--
where
they
were
raised
by
guardians
who
were
usually
Mujahedeen
supporters
.
When
they
were
18
or
19
,
many
of
them
decided
to
come
back
to
Iraq
and
fill
the
ranks
of
the
youngest
Mujahedeen
generation
.
Though
''
decided
''
is
probably
not
the
right
word
,
since
from
the
day
they
were
born
,
these
girls
and
boys
were
not
taught
to
think
for
themselves
but
to
blindly
follow
their
leaders
.
''
Every
morning
and
night
,
the
kids
,
beginning
as
young
as
1
and
2
,
had
to
stand
before
a
poster
of
Massoud
and
Maryam
,
salute
them
and
shout
praises
to
them
,
''
Nadereh
Afshari
,
a
former
Mujahedeen
deep
-
believer
,
told
me
.
Afshari
,
who
was
posted
in
Germany
and
was
responsible
for
receiving
Mujahedeen
children
during
the
gulf
war
,
said
that
when
the
German
government
tried
to
absorb
Mujahedeen
children
into
their
education
system
,
the
Mujahedeen
refused
.
Many
of
the
children
were
sent
to
Mujahedeen
schools
,
particularly
in
France
.
The
Rajavis
,
Afshari
went
on
to
say
,
''
saw
these
kids
as
the
next
generation
's
soldiers
.
They
wanted
to
brainwash
them
and
control
them
.
''
Which
may
explain
the
pattern
to
their
stories
:
a
journey
to
self
-
empowerment
and
the
enlightenment
of
self
-
sacrifice
inspired
by
the
light
and
wisdom
of
Maryam
and
Massoud
.

One
has
to
wonder
whether
the
bright

in

who

n't
know
what
they

Richard
,
i
agree
,
Hmmmmmm
.
How
are
chants
of
death
and
suicide
...
morality
.
What
about
Manson
's
tees
bearing
the
message
,
"
Kill
your
parents
"
.
And
were
the
Columbine
killers
acting
out
this
"
real
morality
"
when
they
indescriminately
murdered
their
classmates
.
They
were
death
metal
brainwashed
fans
,
literally
fulfilling
the
death
metal
paradigm
,
er
...
morality
.
(
not
church
morality
,
no
that
is
phoney
,
love
thy
neighbor
...
hell
no
,
kill
thy
neighbor
-
now
that
is
REAL
MORALITY
?????
)
So
,
hmmmm
indeed
.
I
detect
the
hissing
lisp
of
the
lying
serpent
in
this
article
.
The
deathly
inversion
of
truth
,
ala
satanism
.
I
think
the
jury
's
still
out
on
exactly
who
did
the
brainwashing
when
in
regard
to
the
Columbine
killers
.
Perhaps
we
should
look
at
the
death
metal
phenomenon
less
as
an
invitation
to
violence
than
as
a
couter-cultural
response
to
the
over
hypocrisy
of
a
large
percentage
of
the
'
Church
-
Morality
'
crowd
,
which
gives
a
lot
of
lip
service
to
loving
thy
neighbor
,
but
does
n't
apply
that
love
very
far
beyond
their
own
congregation
.
The
last
I
checked
,
the
Satanists
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
catch
up
with
the
death
and
destruction
dealt
out
by
self
-
proclaimed
(
though
false
)
Christians
.
Irony
is
dead
...
Long
live
Irony
!
That
's
it
.
I
'm
firing
my
editor
.
Well
,
it
's
not
as
simple
and
clear
cut
as
all
that
.
We
're
entering
into
some
interesting
and
perhaps
previously
unexplored
socio-political
-
spiritual
territory
here
that
may
require
further
examination
and
serious
introspection
.
The
Kevin
Coogan
publication
posted
on
the
previous
thread
might
serve
as
a
good
launching
point
for
further
discussion
.
The
following
quote
is
from
that
Coogan
article
:
Imaginary
evil
is
romantic
and
varied
;
real
evil
is
gloomy
,
monotonous
,
barren
,
boring
.
Imaginary
good
is
boring
;
real
good
is
always
new
,
marvelous
,
intoxicating
.

Simone

:
I
would
n't
wonder
too
hard
.
The
answer
is
likely
D
:
all
of
the
above
,
due
to
this
being
a
complex
reality
we
live
in
.
But
to
me
,
without
question
,
they
often
know
perfectly
well
.
Here
is
a
thought
:
When
the
appartently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless
and
incompetent
,
it
is
a
most
certain
sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or
hidden
motives
.
They
trust
you
and
me
to
be
befuddled
by
their
actions
,
while
they
"

To
not
buying
the
BS

here
I
am
thinking
that
I
really
must
be
getting
old
.
Since
the
article
was
specifically
about
"
death
metal
"
I
guess
the
author
missed
this
little
tidbit
or
we
just
have
waaaaaaaaaaaaay
different
definitions
of
morality
:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/thisworld/4446342.stm
One
man
's
relentless
search
for
his
missing
son
led
him
to
uncover
one
of
the
most
shocking
crimes
in
post-war
Italy
-
a
tale
of
satanism
and
violence
that
has
gripped
the
country
for
more
than
a
year
.
In
January
1998
Fabio
Tollis
and
Chiara
Marino
,
both
just
16
,
disappeared
.
They
had
been
drinking
at
a
pub
called
the
Midnight
-
the
centre
of
the
heavy
metal
scene
in
Milan
-
and
they
never
came
home
.
The
police
and
many
of
their
friends
just
thought
they
had
run
off
together
.
But
their
parents
refused
to
accept
this
.
Michele
Tollis
,
Fabio
's
father
,
began
to
attend
metal
concerts
and
festivals
across
Europe
,
handing
out
leaflets
and
quizzing
Fabio
's
friends
.
Fabio
and
his
friends
were
into
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy
metal
music
-
death
metal
and
black
metal
,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and
satanism
-
and
the
role
of
this
music
is
central
to
the
story
.
No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I
say
that
heavy
metal
and
satanism
are
closely
linked
Michele
Tollis
It
emerged
that
Chiara
,
the
girl
who
disappeared
with
Fabio
,
had
a
collection
of
satanic
literature
and
paraphernalia
in
her
bedroom
.
During
this
search
,
Michele
Tollis
became
convinced
that
satanism
had
something
to
do
with
his
son
's
disappearance
.
They
're
inseparable
,
"
he
says
.
Yeah
,
I
think
Jeff
wrote
on
one
of
his
posts
here
in
the
past
several
months
:
"
To
hell
with
death
"
.
I
wholly
agree
,
and
would
expand
that
statement
to
include
:
"
To
hell
with
death
metal
"
.
The
freaky
thing
here
is
that
these
bozos
are
seriously
claiming
the
moral
high
ground
?
?
?
?
?
Talk
about
a
beat
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
!
And
for
'
Smartwolf
'
above
,
think
about
the
inversion
principle
being
employed
.
They
are
doing
it
deliberately
.
Do
you
really
think
GWB
,
and
neocons
in
general
are
representative
of
true
followers
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
?
(
I
know
,
ignorant
question
)
Then
why
call
them
,
or
any
other
phonies
'
Christians
'
,
even
if
they
themselves
claim
the
appellation
.
They
are
merely
imposters
.
Everything
they
claim
is
a
lie
,
and
this
above
all
.
So
why
even
credit
their
claims
?
This
only
serves
their
purposes
.
They
want
to
be
identified
as
'
Christians
'
,
and
I
fully
suspect
that
for
some
of
them
,
the
motivation
behind
their
subterfuge
is
more
than
mere
political
advantage
,
and
has
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
black
magician
's
practice
of
the
inversion
principle
.
We
need
to
be
more
'
rigorous
'
about
how
we
perceive
these
people
.
See
them
as
they
are
,
not
for
what
they
claim
to
be
.
...
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy
metal
music
-
death
metal
and
black
metal
,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and
satanism
-
and
the
role
of
this
music
is
central
to
the
story
.
Almost
all
of
the
avant
guard
art
movements
of
the
early
20th
Century
(
except
for
Italian
Futurism
)
were
labeled
'
degenerate
'
by
the
National
Socialists
.
Adolf
Hitler
even
held
an
exhibition
of
'
degenerate
art
'
in
1937
,
while
curating
a
parallel
show
of
'
Aryan
'
art
across
the
street
.
The
German
Expressionist
movement
was
destroyed
as
a
result
.
Here
's
a
quick
overview
of
the
Entartete
Kunst
(
Degenerate
Art
)
exhibit
of
1937
:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerateart
Ironically
(
or
perhaps
not
)
,
the
notion
of
the
'
degenerate
'
and
'
degenerate
art
'
was
appropriated
by
the
Nazis
and
its
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
Jewish
'
intellectual
'
Max
Nordau
and
a
1892
book
he
authored
called
Degeneration
.
.
Nordau
was
also
the
co
founder
of
the
World
Zionist
Organization
.
When
the
apparently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless
and
incompetent
,
it
is
a
most
certain
sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or
hidden
motives
.
They
trust
you
and
me
to
be
befuddled
by
their
actions
,
while
they
"
do
as
they
wilt
.
"
A
question
:
Are
the
adherent
of
'
Crowleyan
Thelema
'
and
others
of
similar
ilk
appropriating
or
appropriating
from
the
appropriators
to
redirect
'
energy
?
'
Does
this
reappropriation
lead
to
or
originate
from
the
same
place
?
Seems
as
if
there
is
a
clear
distinction
being
made
between
the
'
imaginary
'
Whore
of
Babalon
and
the
actually
Whore
of
Babylon
,
which
is
this
global
system
.
Is
the
distinction
accurate
and
valid
?
Does
the
distinction
actually
exist
?
This
is
where
the
socio
-
political
aspect
of
this
conundrum
comes
into
play
.
Confused
?
Good
.
so
,
enemy
,
what
's
your
point
?
Why
do
n't
you
state
it
?
My
point
is
that
these
are
all
just
questions
and
I
am
undecided
as
to
the
answers
.
Here
's
another
interesting
example
:
John
Balance
from
Coil
.
(
Do
n't
wish
to
use
Wikipedia
again
,
it
's
just
easier
than
spending
time
looking
up
more
obscure
and
detailed
information
.
)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JohnBalance
http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html
Balance
died
in
2004
after
a
'
fall
.
'
He
blended
belief
systems
such
as
Shamanism
,
Christianity
,
Buddhism
,
Paganism
,
Hermeticism
and
Gnosticism
and
imbued
Coil
's
vast
output
with
a
magickal
current
designed
to
have
a
functionally
transcendent
effect
on
listeners
.
Not
200,000
guns
-
the
numbers
do
nt
work
:
5
kg
per
gun
,
200,000
guns
means
1000
tonnes
,
impossible
for
4
containers
.
If
the
load
was
99
tonnes
there
were
probably
less
than
20,000
.
E@tG
:
Maybe
if
you
formulate
your
questions
a
little
more
specifically
it
will
help
you
in
acquiring
the
answers
.
I
am
,
therefore
I
think
:)
Reporting
from
the
town
where
Susan
Polk
's
trial
is
going
on
.
I
went
across
the
bay
last
night
to
attend
a
farmer
's
market
and
music
event
.
Lo
and
behold
,
the
Mormons
were
there
with
a
booth
.
Two
young
men
delivering
information
about
the
Mormon
genealogy
program
.
Just
give
your
email
and
/
or
phone
number
to
these
guys
and
they
'll
track
down
your
family
.
I
was
amazed
at
the
spiel
they
delivered
.
Kindly
young
men
,
but
utterly
programmed
and
brain
-
dead
.
I
resisted
asking
any
questions
that
would
have
required
either
of
them
to
think
.
It
would
have
been
too
painful
to
watch
.
Has
anyone
read
the
letter
purportedly
from
Ahmadinejad
to
George
Bush
?
http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?id=4503
I
do
n't
know
if
this
has
been
verified
.
But
succintly
making
point
after
succint
point
,
the
text
of
the
letter
stands
on
its
own
merit
,
regardless
.
I
like
to
imagine
the
thought
processes
going
on
in
W
's
head
if
he
were
to
actually
read
the
letter
,
but
it
is
hard
to
picture
him
actually
reading
this
letter
.
As
I
read
the
letter
,
I
considered
the
vast
contrast
between
mind
and
morality
of
whoever
wrote
it
,
vs.
that
of
the
mind
of
the
man
who
once
said
"

,
that
's
for
damn

.

TroubleFunk
.
Tronicus
:
Simply
,
the
questions
permeate
the
entire
'
Western
(
Mystery
)
Tradition
'
and
perhaps
'
Eastern
'
as
well
,
as
they
relate
to
the
confluence
of
politics
and
spirituality
.
For
example
,
is
the
system
of
Crowleyan
Thelema
a
failed
alchemical
process
?
Or
was
it
supposed
to
initially
be
a
process
of
alchemical
appropriation
?
Similarly
,
is
invoking
ancient
Egyptian
gods
and
goddesses
a
reaffirmation
of
an
oppressive
and
hierarchical
system
?
In
my
opinion
,
people
can
no
longer
afford
to
partition
out
and
compartmentalize
personal
spiritual
and
political
systems
.
The
'
high
weirdness
'
and
more
hardcore
political
'
factions
'
must
perhaps
integrate
and
arrive
at
a
synthesis
.
In
regards
to
death
metal
,
the
problem
is
,
once
again
,
a
question
of
education
,
history
and
the
vacuous
lack
of
perspective
in
American
culture
.
Shall
we
censor
the
works
of
poet
Charles
Baudelaire
as
well
?
Baudelaire
was
perhaps
one
of
the
first
'
death
metal
'
artists
.
Tronicus
,
if
you
're
still
checking
this
thread
:
A
bit
of
a
knee
-
jerk
reaction
from
me
there
,
and
I
apologize
for
my
over-generalizations
.
My
real
problem
is
with
literalist
fundamentalists
,
of
any
religion
.
True
believers
are
dangerous
animals
.
I
just
get
hung
up
on
'
Christians
'
,
as
they
're
the
dominant
form
where
I
come
from
.
Also
,
I
'm
quite
clear
on
the
fact
that
those
in
power
now
(
and
,
in
general
,
most
anyone
at
the
top
of
a
pyrimidal
power
structure
)
tend
to
use
the
dominant
religion
as
a
cloak
to
hide
their
true
motivations
and
as
a
tool
to
control
the
masses
.
It
boggles
the
mind
that
ANYONE
can
take
at
face
value
Bush
's
claims
to
be
a
christian
,
yet
many
seem
to
do
just
that
.
I
seem
to
remember
something
about
'
by
their
works
shall
ye
know
them
.
"
I
do
get
my
hackles
up
a
bit
when
people
haul
out
the
old
'
Rock
-
N
-
Roll
made
them
do
it
'
argument
.
Whie
I
do
n't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
the
things
we
watch
or
listen
to
have
no
effect
on
our
behavior
(
which
I
think
is
patently
rediculous
)
,
it
does
bother
me
when
people
single
out
a
specific
group
of
people
to
pin
the
blame
on
.
Sub-cultures
(
as
the
lable
implies
)
do
not
develope
in
a
vacuum
.
Again
,
I
think
the
problem
is
people
who
sink
to
far
into
their
own
egos
,
and
begin
to
take
their
personal
metaphors
a
bit
too
literaly
.
These
people
are
dangerous
wether
they
're
head
-
banging
to
'
Canibal
Corpse
'
or
humming
along
to
'
Onward
Christian
Soldiers
'
.
(
The
mixing
of
religion
and
militarism
is
a
whole
other
topic
....
)
I
have
nothing
but
respect
for
people
who
adhear
to
non-violence
,
forgiveness
,
and
charity
,
but
it
's
important
to
remember
that
Christians
(
or
'
Smartwolves
'
)
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
that
particular
lifestyle
.
Peace
.
The
fact
that
the
US
government
and
media
are
having
a
hissy
fit
over
Venezuela
wanting
to
buy
guns
,
and
then
200,000
of
the
guns
Chavez
wants
to
buy
go
missing
on
their
way
to
Iraq
is
definitely
sus
.
I
guess
those
guns
will
be
located
enroute
to
Venezuela
or
found
in
storage
there
by
one
of
the
US
's
local
stooges
and
they
then
have
a
pretext
to
ramp
the
spin
up
a
notch
or
two
.
Thanks
again
to
my
friend
Nick
Keck
for
passing
this
along
via
e-mail
.
It
is
the
text
of
a
speech
given
by
an
Arab
gentleman
before
the
advisory
board
of
a
large
multi-nation
corporation
.
It
's
a
long
but
very
worthwhile
read
.
A
View
from
the
Eye
of
the
Storm
Talk
delivered
by
Haim
Harari
at
a
meeting
of
the
International
Advisory
Board
of
a
large
multi-national
corporation
,
April
,
2004
:
As
you
know
,
I
usually
provide
the
scientific
and
technological
entertainment
"
in
our
meetings
,
but
,
on
this
occasion
,
our
Chairman
suggested
that
I
present
my
own
personal
view
on
events
in
the
part
of
the
world
from
which
I
come
.
I
have
never
been
and
I
will
never
be
a
Government
official
and
I
have
no
privileged
information
.
My
perspective
is
entirely
based
on
what
I
see
,
on
what
I
read
and
on
the
fact
that
my
family
has
lived
in
this
region
for
almost
200
years
.
You
may
regard
my
views
as
those
of
the
proverbial
taxi
driver
,
which
you
are
supposed
to
question
,
when
you
visit
a
country
.
I
could
have
shared
with
you
some
fascinating
facts
and
some
personal
thoughts
about
the
Israeli
-
Arab
conflict
.
However
,
I
will
touch
upon
it
only
in
passing
.
I
prefer
to
devote
most
of
my
remarks
to
the
broader
picture
of
the
region
and
its
place
in
world
events
.
I
refer
to
the
entire
area
between
Pakistan
and
Morocco
,
which
is
predominantly
Arab
,
predominantly
Moslem
,
but
includes
many
non-Arab
and
also
significant
non-Moslem
minorities
.
Why
do
I
put
aside
Israel
and
its
own
immediate
neighborhood
?
Because
Israel
and
any
problems
related
to
it
,
in
spite
of
what
you
might
read
or
hear
in
the
world
media
,
is
not
the
central
issue
,
and
has
never
been
the
central
issue
in
the
upheaval
in
the
region
.
Yes
,
there
is
a
100
year
-
old
Israeli
-
Arab
conflict
,
but
it
is
not
where
the
main
show
is
.
The
millions
who
died
in
the
Iran
-
Iraq
war
had
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
The
mass
murder
happening
right
now
in
Sudan
,
where
the
Arab
Moslem
regime
is
massacring
its
black
Christian
citizens
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
The
frequent
reports
from
Algeria
about
the
murders
of
hundreds
of
civilians
in
one
village
or
another
by
other
Algerians
have
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
Saddam
Hussein
did
not
invade
Kuwait
,
endanger
Saudi
Arabia
and
butcher
his
own
people
because
of
Israel
.
Egypt
did
not
use
poison
gas
against
Yemen
in
the
60's
because
of
Israel
.
Assad
the
Father
did
not
kill
tens
of
thousands
of
his
own
citizens
in
one
week
in
El
Hamma
in
Syria
because
of
Israel
.
The
Taliban
control
of
Afghanistan
and
the
civil
war
there
had
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
The
Libyan
blowing
up
of
the
Pan
-
Am
flight
had
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
,
and
I
could
go
on
and
on
and
on
.
The
root
of
the
trouble
is
that
this
entire
Moslem
region
is
totally
dysfunctional
,
by
any
standard
of
the
word
,
and
would
have
been
so
even
if
Israel
had
joined
the
Arab
league
and
an
independent
Palestine
had
existed
for
100
years
.
The
22
member
countries
of
the
Arab
league
,
from
Mauritania
to
the
Gulf
States
,
have
a
total
population
of
300
millions
,
larger
than
the
US
and
almost
as
large
as
the
EU
before
its
expansion
.
They
have
a
land
area
larger
than
either
the
US
or
all
of
Europe
.
These
22
countries
,
with
all
their
oil
and
natural
resources
,
have
a
combined
GDP
smaller
than
that
of
Netherlands
plus
Belgium
and
equal
to
half
of
the
GDP
of
California
alone
.
Within
this
meager
GDP
,
the
gaps
between
rich
and
poor
are
beyond
belief
and
too
many
of
the
rich
made
their
money
not
by
succeeding
in
business
,
but
by
being
corrupt
rulers
.
The
social
status
of
women
is
far
below
what
it
was
in
the
Western
World
150
years
ago
.
Human
rights
are
below
any
reasonable
standard
,
in
spite
of
the
grotesque
fact
that
Libya
was
elected
Chair
of
the
UN
Human
Rights
commission
.
According
to
a
report
prepared
by
a
committee
of
Arab
intellectuals
and
published
under
the
auspices
of
the
U.N.
,
the
number
of
books
translated
by
the
entire
Arab
world
is
much
smaller
than
what
little
Greece
alone
translates
.
The
total
number
of
scientific
publications
of
300
million
Arabs
is
less
than
that
of
6
million
Israelis
.
Birth
rates
in
the
region
are
very
high
,
increasing
the
poverty
,
the
social
gaps
and
the
cultural
decline
.
And
all
of
this
is
happening
in
a
region
,
which
only
30
years
ago
,
was
believed
to
be
the
next
wealthy
part
of
the
world
,
and
in
a
Moslem
area
,
which
developed
,
at
some
point
in
history
,
one
of
the
most
advanced
cultures
in
the
world
.
It
is
fair
to
say
that
this
creates
an
unprecedented
breeding
ground
for
cruel
dictators
,
terror
networks
,
fanaticism
,
incitement
,
suicide
murders
and
general
decline
.
It
is
also
a
fact
that
almost
everybody
in
the
region
blames
this
situation
on
the
United
States
,
on
Israel
,
on
Western
Civilization
,
on
Judaism
and
Christianity
,
on
anyone
and
anything
,
except
themselves
.
A
word
about
the
millions
of
decent
,
honest
,
good
people
who
are
either
devout
Moslems
or
are
not
very
religious
but
grew
up
in
Moslem
families
:
They
are
double
victims
of
an
outside
world
,
which
now
develops
Islamophobia
,
and
of
their
own
environment
which
breaks
their
heart
by
being
totally
dysfunctional
.
The
problem
is
that
the
vast
silent
majority
of
these
Moslems
are
not
part
of
the
terror
and
the
incitement
,
but
they
also
do
not
stand
up
against
it
.
They
become
accomplices
,
by
omission
,
and
this
applies
to
political
leaders
,
intellectuals
,
business
people
and
many
others
.
Many
of
them
can
certainly
tell
right
from
wrong
,
but
are
afraid
to
express
their
views
.
The
events
of
the
last
few
years
have
amplified
four
issues
,
which
have
always
existed
,
but
have
never
been
as
rampant
as
in
the
present
upheaval
in
the
region
.
A
few
more
years
may
pass
before
everybody
acknowledges
that
it
is
a
World
War
,
but
we
are
already
well
into
it
.
These
are
the
four
main
pillars
of
the
current
World
Conflict
,
or
perhaps
we
should
already
refer
to
it
as
"
the
undeclared
World
War
III
"
:
*
1
.
The
first
element
is
the
suicide
murder
.
*
Suicide
murders
are
not
a
new
invention
but
they
have
been
made
popular
,
if
I
may
use
this
expression
,
only
lately
.
Even
after
September
11
,
it
seems
that
most
of
the
Western
World
does
not
yet
understand
this
weapon
.
It
is
a
very
potent
psychological
weapon
.
Its
real
direct
impact
is
relatively
minor
.
The
total
number
of
casualties
from
hundreds
of
suicide
murders
within
Israel
in
the
last
three
years
is
much
smaller
than
those
due
to
car
accidents
.
September
11
was
quantitatively
much
less
lethal
than
many
earthquakes
More
people
die
from
AIDS
in
one
day
in
Africa
than
all
the
Russians
who
died
in
the
hands
of
Chechnya
-
based
Moslem
suicide
murderers
since
that
conflict
started
.
Saddam
killed
every
month
more
people
than
all
those
who
died
from
suicide
murders
since
the
Coalition
occupation
of
Iraq
.
So
what
is
all
the
fuss
about
suicide
killings
?
It
creates
headlines
.
It
is
spectacular
.
It
is
frightening
.
It
is
a
very
cruel
death
with
bodies
dismembered
and
horrible
severe
lifelong
injuries
to
many
of
the
wounded
.
It
is
always
shown
on
television
in
great
detail
.
One
such
murder
,
with
the
help
of
hysterical
media
coverage
,
can
destroy
the
tourism
industry
of
a
country
for
quite
a
while
,
as
it
did
in
Bali
and
in
Turkey
.
But
the
real
fear
comes
from
the
undisputed
fact
that
no
defense
and
no
preventive
measures
can
succeed
against
a
determined
suicide
murderer
.
This
has
not
yet
penetrated
the
thinking
of
the
Western
World
.
The
U.S.
and
Europe
are
constantly
improving
their
defense
against
the
last
murder
,
not
the
next
one
.
We
may
arrange
for
the
best
airport
security
in
the
world
.
But
if
you
want
to
murder
by
suicide
,
you
do
not
have
to
board
a
plane
in
order
to
explode
yourself
and
kill
many
people
.
Who
could
stop
a
suicide
murder
in
the
midst
of
the
crowded
line
waiting
to
be
checked
by
the
airport
metal
detector
?
How
about
the
lines
to
the
check
-
in
counters
in
a
busy
travel
period
?
Put
a
metal
detector
in
front
of
every
train
station
in
Spain
and
the
terrorists
will
get
the
buses
.
Protect
the
buses
and
they
will
explode
in
movie
theaters
,
concert
halls
,
supermarkets
,
shopping
malls
,
schools
and
hospitals
.
Put
guards
in
front
of
every
concert
hall
and
there
will
always
be
a
line
of
people
to
be
checked
by
the
guards
and
this
line
will
be
the
target
,
not
to
speak
of
killing
the
guards
themselves
.
You
can
somewhat
reduce
your
vulnerability
by
preventive
and
defensive
measures
and
by
strict
border
controls
but
not
eliminate
it
and
definitely
not
win
the
war
in
a
defensive
way
.
And
it
is
a
war
!
What
is
behind
the
suicide
murders
?
Money
is
,
money
and
power
and
cold
-
blooded
murderous
incitement
,
nothing
else
.
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
true
fanatic
religious
beliefs
.
No
Moslem
preacher
has
ever
blown
himself
up
.
No
son
of
an
Arab
politician
or
religious
leader
has
ever
blown
himself
up
.
No
relative
of
anyone
influential
has
done
it
.
Would
n't
you
expect
some
of
the
religious
leaders
to
do
it
themselves
,
or
to
talk
their
sons
into
doing
it
,
if
this
is
truly
a
supreme
act
of
religious
fervor
?
Are
n't
they
interested
in
the
benefits
of
going
to
Heaven
?
Instead
,
they
send
outcast
women
,
naive
children
,
retarded
people
and
young
incited
hotheads
.
They
promise
them
the
delights
,
mostly
sexual
,
of
the
next
world
,
and
pay
their
families
handsomely
after
the
supreme
act
is
performed
and
enough
innocent
people
are
dead
.
Suicide
murders
also
have
nothing
to
do
with
poverty
and
despair
.
The
poorest
region
in
the
world
,
by
far
,
is
Africa
.
It
never
happens
there
.
There
are
numerous
desperate
people
in
the
world
,
in
different
cultures
,
countries
and
continents
.
Desperation
does
not
provide
anyone
with
explosives
,
reconnaissance
and
transportation
.
There
was
certainly
more
despair
in
Saddam
's
Iraq
than
in
Paul
Bremmer
's
Iraq
,
and
no
one
exploded
himself
.
A
suicide
murder
is
simply
a
horrible
,
vicious
weapon
of
cruel
,
inhuman
,
cynical
,
well
-
funded
terrorists
,
with
no
regard
to
human
life
,
including
the
life
of
their
fellow
countrymen
,
but
with
very
high
regard
to
their
own
affluent
well
-
being
and
their
hunger
for
power
.
The
only
way
to
fight
this
new
"
popular
"
weapon
is
identical
to
the
only
way
in
which
you
fight
organized
crime
or
pirates
on
the
high
seas
:
the
offensive
way
.
Like
in
the
case
of
organized
crime
,
it
is
crucial
that
the
forces
on
the
offensive
be
united
and
it
is
crucial
to
reach
the
top
of
the
crime
pyramid
.
You
can
not
eliminate
organized
crime
by
arresting
the
little
drug
dealer
on
the
street
corner
.
You
must
go
after
the
head
of
the
"
Family
"
.
If
part
of
the
public
supports
it
,
others
tolerate
it
,
many
are
afraid
of
it
and
some
try
to
explain
it
away
by
poverty
or
by
a
miserable
childhood
,
organized
crime
will
thrive
and
so
will
terrorism
.
The
United
States
understands
this
now
,
after
September
11
.
Russia
is
beginning
to
understand
it
.
Turkey
understands
it
well
.
I
am
very
much
afraid
that
most
of
Europe
still
does
not
understand
it
.
Unfortunately
,
it
seems
that
Europe
will
understand
it
only
after
suicide
murders
arrive
in
Europe
in
a
big
way
.
In
my
humble
opinion
,
this
will
definitely
happen
.
The
Spanish
trains
and
the
Istanbul
bombings
are
only
the
beginning
.
The
unity
of
the
Civilized
World
in
fighting
this
horror
is
absolutely
indispensable
.
Until
Europe
wakes
up
,
this
unity
will
not
be
achieved
.
*
2
.
The
second
ingredient
is
words
,
more
precisely
lies
.
*
Words
can
be
lethal
.
They
kill
people
.
It
is
often
said
that
politicians
,
diplomats
and
perhaps
also
lawyers
and
business
people
must
sometimes
lie
,
as
part
of
their
professional
life
.
But
the
norms
of
politics
and
diplomacy
are
childish
,
in
comparison
with
the
level
of
incitement
and
total
absolute
deliberate
fabrications
,
which
have
reached
new
heights
in
the
region
we
are
talking
about
.
An
incredible
number
of
people
in
the
Arab
world
believe
that
September
11
never
happened
,
or
was
an
American
provocation
or
,
even
better
,
a
Jewish
plot
.
You
all
remember
the
Iraqi
Minister
of
Information
,
Mr.
Mouhamad
Said
al
-
Sahaf
and
his
press
conferences
when
the
US
forces
were
already
inside
Baghdad
.
Disinformation
at
time
of
war
is
an
accepted
tactic
.
But
to
stand
,
day
after
day
,
and
to
make
such
preposterous
statements
,
known
to
everybody
to
be
lies
,
without
even
being
ridiculed
in
your
own
milieu
,
can
only
happen
in
this
region
.
Mr.
Sahaf
eventually
became
a
popular
icon
as
a
court
jester
,
but
this
did
not
stop
some
allegedly
respectable
newspapers
from
giving
him
equal
time
.
It
also
does
not
prevent
the
Western
press
from
giving
credence
,
every
day
,
even
now
,
to
similar
liars
.
After
all
,
if
you
want
to
be
an
anti-Semite
,
there
are
subtle
ways
of
doing
it
.
You
do
not
have
to
claim
that
the
holocaust
never
happened
,
and
that
the
Jewish
temple
in
Jerusalem
never
existed
.
But
millions
of
Moslems
are
told
by
their
leaders
that
this
is
the
case
.
When
these
same
leaders
make
other
statements
,
the
Western
media
report
them
as
if
they
could
be
true
.
It
is
a
daily
occurrence
that
the
same
people
who
finance
,
arm
and
dispatch
suicide
murderers
,
condemn
the
act
in
English
in
front
of
western
TV
cameras
,
talking
to
a
world
audience
,
which
even
partly
believes
them
.
It
is
a
daily
routine
to
hear
the
same
leader
making
opposite
statements
in
Arabic
to
his
people
and
in
English
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Incitement
by
Arab
TV
,
accompanied
by
horror
pictures
of
mutilated
bodies
,
has
become
a
powerful
weapon
of
those
who
lie
,
distort
and
want
to
destroy
everything
.
Little
children
are
raised
on
deep
hatred
and
on
admiration
of
so
-
called
martyrs
,
and
the
Western
World
does
not
notice
it
because
its
own
TV
sets
are
mostly
tuned
to
soap
operas
and
game
shows
.
I
recommend
to
you
,
even
though
most
of
you
do
not
understand
Arabic
,
to
watch
Al
Jazeera
,
from
time
to
time
.
You
will
not
believe
your
own
eyes
.
But
words
also
work
in
other
ways
,
more
subtle
.
A
demonstration
in
Berlin
,
carrying
banners
supporting
Saddam
's
regime
and
featuring
three
-
year
old
babies
dressed
as
suicide
murderers
,
is
defined
by
the
press
and
by
political
leaders
as
a
"
peace
demonstration
"
.
You
may
support
or
oppose
the
Iraq
war
,
but
to
refer
to
fans
of
Saddam
,
Arafat
or
Bin
Laden
as
peace
activists
is
a
bit
too
much
.
A
woman
walks
into
an
Israeli
restaurant
in
mid-day
,
eats
,
observes
families
with
old
people
and
children
eating
their
lunch
in
the
adjacent
tables
and
pays
the
bill
.
She
then
blows
herself
up
,
killing
20
people
,
including
many
children
,
with
heads
and
arms
rolling
around
in
the
restaurant
.
She
is
called
"
martyr
"
by
several
Arab
leaders
and
"
activist
"
by
the
European
press
.
Dignitaries
condemn
the
act
but
visit
her
bereaved
family
and
the
money
flows
.
There
is
a
new
game
in
town
:
The
actual
murderer
is
called
"
the
military
wing
"
,
the
one
who
pays
him
,
equips
him
and
sends
him
is
now
called
"
the
political
wing
"
and
the
head
of
the
operation
is
called
the
"
spiritual
leader
"
.
There
are
numerous
other
examples
of
such
Orwellian
nomenclature
,
used
every
day
not
only
by
terror
chiefs
but
also
by
Western
media
.
These
words
are
much
more
dangerous
than
many
people
realize
.
They
provide
an
emotional
infrastructure
for
atrocities
.
It
was
Joseph
Goebbels
who
said
that
if
you
repeat
a
lie
often
enough
,
people
will
believe
it
.
He
is
now
being
outperformed
by
his
successors
.
*
3
.
The
third
aspect
is
money
.
*
Huge
amounts
of
money
,
which
could
have
solved
many
social
problems
in
this
dysfunctional
part
of
the
world
,
are
channeled
into
three
concentric
spheres
supporting
death
and
murder
.
In
the
inner
circle
are
the
terrorists
themselves
.
The
money
funds
their
travel
,
explosives
,
hideouts
and
permanent
search
for
soft
vulnerable
targets
.
The
inner
circles
are
primarily
financed
by
terrorist
states
like
Iran
and
Syria
,
until
recently
also
by
Iraq
and
Libya
and
earlier
also
by
some
of
the
Communist
regimes
.
These
states
,
as
well
as
the
Palestinian
Authority
,
are
the
safe
havens
of
the
wholesale
murder
vendors
.
They
are
surrounded
by
a
second
wider
circle
of
direct
supporters
,
planners
,
commanders
,
preachers
,
all
of
whom
make
a
living
,
usually
a
very
comfortable
living
,
by
serving
as
terror
infrastructure
.
Finally
,
we
find
the
third
circle
of
so
-
called
religious
,
educational
and
welfare
organizations
,
which
actually
do
some
good
,
feed
the
hungry
and
provide
some
schooling
,
but
brainwash
a
new
generation
with
hatred
,
lies
and
ignorance
.
This
circle
operates
mostly
through
mosques
,
madrasas
and
other
religious
establishments
but
also
through
inciting
electronic
and
printed
media
.
It
is
this
circle
that
makes
sure
that
women
remain
inferior
,
that
democracy
is
unthinkable
and
that
exposure
to
the
outside
world
is
minimal
.
It
is
also
that
circle
that
leads
the
way
in
blaming
everybody
outside
the
Moslem
world
,
for
the
miseries
of
the
region
.
The
outer
circle
is
largely
financed
by
Saudi
Arabia
,
but
also
by
donations
from
certain
Moslem
communities
in
the
United
States
and
Europe
and
,
to
a
smaller
extent
,
by
donations
of
European
Governments
to
various
NGO's
and
by
certain
United
Nations
organizations
,
whose
goals
may
be
noble
,
but
they
are
infested
and
exploited
by
agents
of
the
outer
circle
.
The
Saudi
regime
,
of
course
,
will
be
the
next
victim
of
major
terror
,
when
the
inner
circle
will
explode
into
the
outer
circle
.
The
Saudis
are
beginning
to
understand
it
,
but
they
fight
the
inner
circles
,
while
still
financing
the
infrastructure
at
the
outer
circle
.
Figuratively
speaking
,
this
outer
circle
is
the
guardian
,
which
makes
sure
that
the
people
look
and
listen
inwards
to
the
inner
circle
of
terror
and
incitement
,
rather
than
to
the
world
outside
.
Some
parts
of
this
same
outer
circle
actually
operate
as
a
result
of
fear
from
,
or
blackmail
by
,
the
inner
circles
.
The
horrifying
added
factor
is
the
high
birth
rate
.
Half
of
the
population
of
the
Arab
world
is
under
the
age
of
20
,
the
most
receptive
age
to
incitement
,
guaranteeing
two
more
generations
of
blind
hatred
.
Some
of
the
leaders
of
these
various
circles
live
very
comfortably
on
their
loot
.
You
meet
their
children
in
the
best
private
schools
in
Europe
,
not
in
the
training
camps
of
suicide
murderers
.
The
Jihad
"
soldiers
"
join
packaged
death
tours
to
Iraq
and
other
hotspots
,
while
some
of
their
leaders
ski
in
Switzerland
.
Mrs.
Arafat
,
who
lives
in
Paris
with
her
daughter
,
receives
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
per
month
from
the
allegedly
bankrupt
Palestinian
Authority
,
while
a
typical
local
ringleader
of
the
Al
-
Aksa
brigade
,
reporting
to
Arafat
,
receives
only
a
cash
payment
of
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
,
for
performing
murders
at
the
retail
level
.
*
4
.
The
fourth
element
of
the
current
world
conflict
is
the
total
breaking
of
all
laws
.
*
The
civilized
world
believes
in
democracy
,
the
rule
of
law
,
including
international
law
,
human
rights
,
free
speech
and
free
press
,
among
other
liberties
.
There
are
naive
old
-
fashioned
habits
such
as
respecting
religious
sites
and
symbols
,
not
using
ambulances
and
hospitals
for
acts
of
war
,
avoiding
the
mutilation
of
dead
bodies
and
not
using
children
as
human
shields
or
human
bombs
.
Never
in
history
,
not
even
in
the
Nazi
period
,
was
there
such
total
disregard
of
all
of
the
above
as
we
observe
now
.
Every
student
of
political
science
debates
how
you
prevent
an
anti-democratic
force
from
winning
a
democratic
election
and
abolishing
democracy
.
Other
aspects
of
a
civilized
society
must
also
have
limitations
.
Can
a
policeman
open
fire
on
someone
trying
to
kill
him
?
Can
a
government
listen
to
phone
conversations
of
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
?
Does
free
speech
protect
you
when
you
shout
"
fire
"
in
a
crowded
theater
?
Should
there
be
death
penalty
,
for
deliberate
multiple
murders
?
These
are
the
old
-
fashioned
dilemmas
.
But
now
we
have
an
entire
new
set
.
Do
you
raid
a
mosque
,
which
serves
as
a
terrorist
ammunition
storage
?
Do
you
return
fire
,
if
you
are
attacked
from
a
hospital
?
Do
you
storm
a
church
taken
over
by
terrorists
who
took
the
priests
hostages
?
Do
you
search
every
ambulance
after
a
few
suicide
murderers
use
ambulances
to
reach
their
targets
?
Do
you
strip
every
woman
because
one
pretended
to
be
pregnant
and
carried
a
suicide
bomb
on
her
belly
?
Do
you
shoot
back
at
someone
trying
to
kill
you
,
standing
deliberately
behind
a
group
of
children
?
Do
you
raid
terrorist
headquarters
,
hidden
in
a
mental
hospital
?
Do
you
shoot
an
arch-murderer
who
deliberately
moves
from
one
location
to
another
,
always
surrounded
by
children
?
All
of
these
happen
daily
in
Iraq
and
in
the
Palestinian
areas
.
What
do
you
do
?
Well
,
you
do
not
want
to
face
the
dilemma
.
But
it
can
not
be
avoided
.
Suppose
,
for
the
sake
of
discussion
,
that
someone
would
openly
stay
in
a
well
-
known
address
in
Teheran
,
hosted
by
the
Iranian
Government
and
financed
by
it
,
executing
one
atrocity
after
another
in
Spain
or
in
France
,
killing
hundreds
of
innocent
people
,
accepting
responsibility
for
the
crimes
,
promising
in
public
TV
interviews
to
do
more
of
the
same
,
while
the
Government
of
Iran
issues
public
condemnations
of
his
acts
but
continues
to
host
him
,
invite
him
to
official
functions
and
treat
him
as
a
great
dignitary
.
I
leave
it
to
you
as
homework
to
figure
out
what
Spain
or
France
would
have
done
,
in
such
a
situation
.
The
problem
is
that
the
civilized
world
is
still
having
illusions
about
the
rule
of
law
in
a
totally
lawless
environment
.
It
is
trying
to
play
ice
hockey
by
sending
a
ballerina
ice
-
skater
into
the
ring
or
to
knock
out
a
heavyweight
boxer
by
a
chess
player
.
In
the
same
way
that
no
country
has
a
law
against
cannibals
eating
its
prime
minister
,
because
such
an
act
is
unthinkable
,
international
law
does
not
address
killers
shooting
from
hospitals
,
mosques
and
ambulances
,
while
being
protected
by
their
Government
or
society
.
International
law
does
not
know
how
to
handle
someone
who
sends
children
to
throw
stones
,
stands
behind
them
and
shoots
with
immunity
and
can
not
be
arrested
because
he
is
sheltered
by
a
Government
.
International
law
does
not
know
how
to
deal
with
a
leader
of
murderers
who
is
royally
and
comfortably
hosted
by
a
country
,
which
pretends
to
condemn
his
acts
or
just
claims
to
be
too
weak
to
arrest
him
.
The
amazing
thing
is
that
all
of
these
crooks
demand
protection
under
international
law
,
and
define
all
those
who
attack
them
as
"
war
criminals
,
"
with
some
Western
media
repeating
the
allegations
.
The
good
news
is
that
all
of
this
is
temporary
,
because
the
evolution
of
international
law
has
always
adapted
itself
to
reality
.
The
punishment
for
suicide
murder
should
be
death
or
arrest
before
the
murder
,
not
during
and
not
after
.
After
every
world
war
,
the
rules
of
international
law
have
changed
,
and
the
same
will
happen
after
the
present
one
.
But
during
the
twilight
zone
,
a
lot
of
harm
can
be
done
.
The
picture
I
described
here
is
not
pretty
.
What
can
we
do
about
it
?
In
the
short
run
,
only
fight
and
win
.
In
the
long
run
,
only
educate
the
next
generation
and
open
it
to
the
world
.
The
inner
circles
can
and
must
be
destroyed
by
force
.
The
outer
circle
can
not
be
eliminated
by
force
.
Here
we
need
financial
starvation
of
the
organizing
elite
,
more
power
to
women
,
more
education
,
counter-propaganda
,
boycott
whenever
feasible
and
access
to
Western
media
,
internet
and
the
international
scene
.
Above
all
,
we
need
a
total
absolute
unity
and
determination
of
the
civilized
world
against
all
three
circles
of
evil
.
Allow
me
,
for
a
moment
,
to
depart
from
my
alleged
role
as
a
taxi
driver
and
return
to
science
.
When
you
have
a
malignant
tumor
,
you
may
remove
the
tumor
itself
surgically
.
You
may
also
starve
it
by
preventing
new
blood
from
reaching
it
from
other
parts
of
the
body
,
thereby
preventing
new
"
supplies
"
from
expanding
the
tumor
.
If
you
want
to
be
sure
,
it
is
best
to
do
both
.
But
before
you
fight
and
win
,
by
force
or
otherwise
,
you
have
to
realize
that
you
are
in
a
war
,
and
this
may
take
Europe
a
few
more
years
.
In
order
to
win
,
it
is
necessary
to
first
eliminate
the
terrorist
regimes
,
so
that
no
Government
in
the
world
will
serve
as
a
safe
haven
for
these
people
.
I
do
not
want
to
comment
here
on
whether
the
American
-
led
attack
on
Iraq
was
justified
from
the
point
of
view
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
or
any
other
pre-war
argument
,
but
I
can
look
at
the
post-war
map
of
Western
Asia
.
Now
that
Afghanistan
,
Iraq
and
Libya
are
out
,
two
and
a
half
terrorist
states
remain
:
Iran
,
Syria
and
Lebanon
,
the
latter
being
a
Syrian
colony
.
Perhaps
Sudan
should
be
added
to
the
list
.
As
a
result
of
the
conquest
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
,
both
Iran
and
Syria
are
now
totally
surrounded
by
territories
unfriendly
to
them
.
Iran
is
encircled
by
Afghanistan
,
by
the
Gulf
States
,
Iraq
and
the
Moslem
republics
of
the
former
Soviet
Union
.
Syria
is
surrounded
by
Turkey
,
Iraq
,
Jordan
and
Israel
.
This
is
a
significant
strategic
change
and
it
applies
strong
pressure
on
the
terrorist
countries
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
Iran
is
so
active
in
trying
to
incite
a
Shiite
uprising
in
Iraq
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
American
plan
was
actually
to
encircle
both
Iran
and
Syria
,
but
that
is
the
resulting
situation
.
In
my
humble
opinion
,
the
number
one
danger
to
the
world
today
is
Iran
and
its
regime
.
It
definitely
has
ambitions
to
rule
vast
areas
and
to
expand
in
all
directions
.
It
has
an
ideology
which
claims
supremacy
over
Western
culture
.
It
is
ruthless
.
It
has
proven
that
it
can
execute
elaborate
terrorist
acts
without
leaving
too
many
traces
,
using
Iranian
Embassies
.
It
is
clearly
trying
to
develop
nuclear
weapons
.
Its
so
-
called
moderates
and
conservatives
play
their
own
virtuoso
version
of
the
"
good
-
cop
versus
bad
-
cop
"
game
.
Iran
sponsors
Syrian
terrorism
,
it
is
certainly
behind
much
of
the
action
in
Iraq
,
it
is
fully
funding
the
Hezbollah
and
,
through
it
,
the
Palestinian
Hamas
and
Islamic
Jihad
;
it
performed
acts
of
terror
at
least
in
Europe
and
in
South
America
and
probably
also
in
Uzbekistan
and
Saudi
Arabia
and
it
truly
leads
a
multi-national
terror
consortium
,
which
includes
,
as
minor
players
,
Syria
,
Lebanon
and
certain
Shiite
elements
in
Iraq
.
Nevertheless
,
most
European
countries
still
trade
with
Iran
,
try
to
appease
it
and
refuse
to
read
the
clear
signals
.
In
order
to
win
the
war
it
is
also
necessary
to
dry
the
financial
resources
of
the
terror
conglomerate
.
It
is
pointless
to
try
to
understand
the
subtle
differences
between
the
Sunni
terror
of
Al
Qaeda
and
Hamas
and
the
Shiite
terror
of
Hezbollah
,
Sadr
and
other
Iranian
-
inspired
enterprises
.
When
it
serves
their
business
needs
,
all
of
them
collaborate
beautifully
.
It
is
crucial
to
stop
Saudi
and
other
financial
support
of
the
outer
circle
,
which
is
the
fertile
breeding
ground
of
terror
.
It
is
important
to
monitor
all
donations
from
the
Western
World
to
Islamic
organizations
,
to
monitor
the
finances
of
international
relief
organizations
and
to
react
with
forceful
economic
measures
to
any
small
sign
of
financial
aid
to
any
of
the
three
circles
of
terrorism
.
It
is
also
important
to
act
decisively
against
the
campaign
of
lies
and
fabrications
and
to
monitor
those
Western
media
who
collaborate
with
it
out
of
naivety
,
financial
interests
or
ignorance
.
Above
all
,
never
surrender
to
terror
.
No
one
will
ever
know
whether
the
recent
elections
in
Spain
would
have
yielded
a
different
result
,
if
not
for
the
train
bombings
a
few
days
earlier
.
But
it
really
does
not
matter
.
What
matters
is
that
the
terrorists
believe
that
they
caused
the
result
and
that
they
won
by
driving
Spain
out
of
Iraq
.
The
Spanish
story
will
surely
end
up
being
extremely
costly
to
other
European
countries
,
including
France
,
who
is
now
expelling
inciting
preachers
and
forbidding
veils
and
including
others
who
sent
troops
to
Iraq
.
In
the
long
run
,
Spain
itself
will
pay
even
more
.
Is
the
solution
a
democratic
Arab
world
?
If
by
democracy
we
mean
free
elections
but
also
free
press

If

On

,
may
be

I
have
no

But
the

Zawahiri
was
associated
with
a
faction
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
known
as
the
Vanguards
of
Conquest
.
Zawahiri
and
the
Vanguards
of
Conquest
were
seeking
to
recreate
Mohammed
's
taking
of
mecca
by
a
small
band
through
violent
attacks
on
Egyptian
leaders
.
By
1998
,
Zawahiri
had
determined
that
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
should
focus
on
its
struggle
against
the
United
States
and
hold
off
on
further
attacks
against
the
Egyptian
regime
.
A
key
question
is
how
they
acquired
the
anthrax
strain
first
isolated
by
the
Texas
Veterinary
Medical
Diagnostic
Lab
in
1980
.
According
to
senior
counter
terrorism
officials
,
both
here
and
abroad
,
among
the
supporters
of
these
militant
islamists
were
people
who
blended
into
society
and
were
available
to
act
when
another
part
of
the
network
requested
it
.

and

:

and
Opportunity
Homeland
Security
In
early
June
2003
,
a
Central
Intelligence
Agency
(
"
CIA
"
)
report
publicly
disclosed
that
the
reason
for
Mohammed
Atta
's
and
Zacarias
Moussaoui
's
inquiries
into
cropdusters
was
for
the
contemplated
use
in
dispersing
biological
agents
such
as
anthrax
.
An
early
September
2003
Newsweek
article
included
a
rumor
by
a
Taliban
source
that
at
a
meeting
in
April
2003
Bin
Laden
was
planning
an
"
unbelievable
"
biological
attack
,
the
plans
for
which
had
suffered
a
setback
upon
the
arrest
of
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammed
(
"
KSM
"
)
.
He
had
been
captured
the
previous
month
in
Rawalpindi
,
Pakistan
.
In
November
2003
,
a
report
by
a
UN
Panel
of
experts
concluded
that
Al
Qaeda
is
determined
to
use
chemical
and
biological
weapons
and
is
restrained
only
by
technical
difficulties
.
In
a
statement
issued
June
16
,
2004
,
the
9/11
Commission
Staff
concluded
that
"
Al
Qaeda
had
an
ambitious
biological
weapons
program
and
was
making
advances
in
its
ability
to
produce
anthrax
prior
to
September
11
.
According
to
Director
of
Central
Intelligence
George
Tenet
,
al
Qaeda
’s
ability
to
conduct
an
anthrax
attack
is
one
of
the
most
immediate
threats
the
United
States
is
likely
to
face
.
"
On
August
9
,
2004
,
it
was
announced
that
in
the
Spring
of
2001
,
a
man
named
El
-
Shukrijumah
,
also
known
as
Jafar
the
Pilot
,
who
was
part
of
a
"
second
wave
,
"
had
been
casing
New
York
City
helicopters
.
Photographs
from
a
seized
computer
disc
included
the
controls
and
the
locks
on
the
door
between
the
passengers
and
pilot
.
In
a
bulletin
,
the
FBI
noted
that
the
surveillance
might
relate
to
a
plot
to
disperse
a
chemical
or
biological
weapon
.
The
CIA
reportedly
has
been
quietly
building
a
case
that
the
anthrax
mailings
were
an
international
plot
.
This
is
old
news
.
It
's
just
no
longer
bureaucratically
impolite
to
openly
contest
the
FBI
's
(
former
)
theory
about
a
lone
,
American
scientist
.
Many
people
have
argued
that
a
US
-
based
Al
Qaeda
operative
is
behind
the
earlier
Fall
2001
anthrax
mailings
in
the
US
,
and
that
the
mailings
served
as
a
threat
and
warning
.
Princeton
islamist
scholar
Bernard
Lewis
has
explained
that
while
islamists
may
disagree
about
whether
killing
innocents
is
sanctioned
by
the
laws
of
jihad
,
extremists
like
Zawahiri
agree
that
notice
must
be
given
before
biochemical
weapons
are
used
.
The
Prophet
's
guidance
,
says
Michael
Scheuer
,
an
al
-
Qaeda
analyst
who
recently
retired
from
the
CIA
and
once
headed
its
Bin
Laden
unit
,
"
was
always
,
Before
you
attack
someone
,
warn
them
very
clearly
...
"
The
anthrax
mailings
followed
the
pattern
of
letters
they
sent
in
January
1997
to
newspaper
branches
in
Washington
,
D.C.
and
New
York
City
,
as
well
as
symbolic
targets
.
The
letter
bombs
were
sent
in
connection
with
the
detention
of
the
blind
sheik
Abdel
Rahman
and
those
responsible
for
the
earlier
World
Trade
Center
bombing
in
1993
.
Handwritten
notes
and
files
on
a
laptop
seized
upon
the
capture
of
KSM
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
3
,
included
a
feasible
anthrax
production
plan
using
a
spray
dryer
and
addressed
the
recruitment
of
necessary
expertise
.
What
your
morning
paper
did
not
tell
you
,
however
,
was
that
the
CIA
seized
a
similar
disc
from
Ayman
Zawahiri
's
right
-
hand
,
Ahmed
Salama
Mabruk
,
5
years
earlier
.
The
computer
disk
was
confiscated
from
him
during
his
arrest
by
the
CIA
in
Azerbaijan
and
handed
over
to
the
Egyptian
authorities
.
Mabruk
,
at
the
time
,
was
the
head
of
Jihad
's
military
operations
.
There
is
a
risk
that
observers
underestimate
the
time
that
Al
Qaeda
has
had
to
make
progress
in
such
recruitment
and
research
and
development
.
Some
may
still
think
that
even
in
the
final
stages
of
the
9/11
plot
,
Zacarias
Moussaoui
was
going
to
fly
a
5th
plane
into
the
Capitol
or
White
House
.
Others
argue
that
he
was
to
be
part
of
a
second
wave
of
airliners
directed
to
targets
on
the
West
Coast
.
There
is
an
e-mail
by
Moussaoui
,
however
,
dated
July
31
,
2001
indicating
that
he
sought
to
take
a
crop
dusting
course
that
was
to
last
up
to
6
months
.
In
March
2003
,
Mohammed
reportedly
said
that
Moussaoui
was
not
going
to
be
part
of
9/11
but
was
to
be
part
of
a
"
second
wave
.
"
Although
Ramzi
Binalshibh
provided
him
$
14,000
in
July
,
accused
September
11
conspirator
Zacarias
Moussaoui
told
his
trial
judge
that
he
had
an
al
Qaeda
mission
that
would
have
come
after
the
terrorist
attacks
.
KSM
explained
that
Moussaoui
's
inquiries
about
crop
dusters
may
have
been
related
to
the
anthrax
work
being
done
by
US
-
trained
biochemist
and
Al
Qaeda
operative
,
Malaysian
Yazid
Sufaat
.
Zacarias
Moussaoui
,
never
the
sharpest
tool
in
the
shed
and
thought
by
his
superiors
to
be
unreliable
,
has
told
the
judge
at
his
trial
in
a
filing
that
he
wants
"
anthrax
for
Jew
sympathizer
only
.
"
Al
Qaeda
's
regional
operative
,
Hambali
,
who
was
at
a
key
January
2000
meeting
and
supervised
Sufaat
,
has
been
captured
.
Hambali
reportedly
is
cooperating
to
some
degree
.
KSM
and
Hambali
sent
al
-
Hindi
(
al
-
Britani
)
,
along
with
Jafar
the
Pilot
,
to
case
NYC
targets
for
a
second
wave
.
It
was
as
part
of
that
surveillance
in
early
2001
that
Jafar
the
Pilot
studied
tourist
helicopters
in
the
NYC
area
.
Sufaat
,
according
to
both
KSM
and
Hambali
,
did
not
have
the
virulent
US
Army
Ames
strain
that
would
be
used
.
That
would
require
someone
who
had
access
to
the
strain
.
But
if
experience
is
any
guide
,
nothing
would
stand
in
the
way
of
Dr.
Ayman
Zawahiri
's
decade
-
long
quest
to
weaponize
and
use
anthrax
against
US
targets
that
was
described
by
one
confidante
to
an
Egyptian
newspaper
reporter
.
The
islamist
had
been
released
from
Egyptian
prison
and
had
known
Zawahiri
well
for
many
years
.
Emails
from
Zawahiri
to
Atef
in
the
Spring
of
1999
indicate
that
Ayman
was
a
close
student
of
the
USAMRIID
anthrax
program
.
He
believed
that
the
koran
instructed
that
a
jihadist
should
use
the
weapons
used
by
the
crusader
.
What
we
know
is
that
he
's
always
said
it
was
a
religious
obligation
to
have
the
same
weapons
as
their
enemies
,
former
CIA
OBL
unit
counter
terrorism
chief
Michael
Scheuer
has
said
.
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reported
that
a
computer
used
by
Zawahiri
contains
a
June
1999
memo
that
"
said
the
program
should
seek
cover
and
talent
in
educational
institutions
,
which
it
said
were
'
more
beneficial
to
us
and
allow
easy
access
to
specialists
,
which
will
greatly
benefit
us
in
the
first
stage
,
God
willing
.

.
A
few
days
before
Christmas
2003
,
after
a
renewed
audiotape
threat
by
Zawahiri
of
attacks
,
to
include
in
the
US
homeland
,
the
threat
level
was
raised
to
orange
or
"
high
.
"
After
the
alert
condition
had
long
since
returned
to
yellow
,
Zawahiri
in
late
February
issued
another
audiotape
.
He
urged
the
President
that
brigades
and
brigades
would
be
coming
under
the
banner
of
jihad
carrying
death
and
seeking
paradise
.
Zawahiri
said
that
the
US
should
expect
another
9/11
on
US
soil
.
According
to
some
reports
,
Zawahiri
is
thought
by
intelligence
to
be
somewhere
near
the
border
of
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
.
At
one
time
,
some
thought
he
had
been
spotted
in
Iran
.
Wherever
he
is
,
authorities
need
to
focus
on
the
traceable
connection
between
him
and
those
he
or
Atef
recruited
.
In
October
2001
,
did
the
FBI
profilers
know
of
the
draft
message
Khalid
Mohammed
had
on
the
seized
laptop
(
from
1995
)
that
was
signed
"
Khalid
Sheik
Bojinka
"
?
The
letter
threatened
to
use
biochemical
weapons
if
the
blind
sheik
was
not
released
.
(
Khalid
Mohammed
's
involvement
dates
back
to
Bojinka
,
as
does
Hambali
's
)
.
Use
of
biochemical
weapons
as
blackmail
and
threatened
retaliation
for
such
detentions
was
an
alternative
scenario
in
the
Bojinka
planning
.
In
May
2004
,
Patrick
Hughes
,
Lieutenant
General
(
Retired
)
,
Assistant
Secretary
for
Information
Analysis
,
Homeland
Security
Department
testified
before
the
9/11
Commission
.
He
explained
that
interrogations
and
other
evidence
revealed
that
Al
Qaeda
wanted
to
strike
the
US
with
a
nonconventional
weapon
,
most
notably
anthrax
.
The
same
week
,
the
WTC
head
testified
that
while
they
had
not
received
any
briefing
on
the
use
of
planes
,
they
had
taken
steps
to
prepare
for
an
attack
using
anthrax
based
on
intelligence
that
had
been
received
.
Al
Qaeda
has
had
anthrax
,
the
raw
seed
product
in
its
unweaponized
form
,
since
at
least
1997
,
when
it
was
purchased
by
Bin
Laden
through
the
Moro
Islamic
Liberation
Front
(
"
Moro
Front
"
or
"
MILF
"
)
.
Zawahiri
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
2
,
is
head
of
Al
Qaeda
's
biochemical
program
.
The
CIA
has
known
of
Zawahiri
's
plans
to
use
anthrax
for
a
half
decade
.
The
confidante
and
right
-
hand
man
of
Dr.
Ayman
Zawahiri
admitted
that
Zawahiri
succeeded
in
obtaining
anthrax
and
intended
to
use
it
against
US
targets
.
Another
senior
Al
Qaeda
member
(
a
shura
or
policy
-
making
council
member
no
less
)
was
working
for
the
Egyptian
intelligence
services
and
he
confirmed
the
report
in
a
sworn
lengthy
confession
.
Even
Zawahiri
's
attorney
in
1999
said
that
Bin
Laden
and
Zawahiri
were
likely
to
resort
to
the
biological
and
chemical
agents
they
possessed
given
the
extradition
pressure
senior
Al
Qaeda
leaders
faced
.
A
recently
released
islamist
who
had
been
a
close
associate
of
Zawahiri
said
that
Zawahiri
spent
a
decade
and
had
made
15
separate
attempts
to
recruit
the
necessary
expertise
to
weaponize
anthrax
in
Russia
and
the
Middle
East
.
The
US
Army
recipe
was
not
used
,
and
obtaining
the
unprocessed
Ames
strain
of
anthrax
used
does
not
warrant
the
weight
given
it
by
some
press
accounts
.
There
was
lax
control
over
the
distribution
of
the
Ames
strain
that
was
used
,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
transfers
were
not
even
required
to
be
recorded
prior
to
1997
.
Significantly
,
the
individual
who
isolated
it
nearly
a
quarter
century
ago
(
now
retired
)
,
upon
being
contacted
,
does
not
even
report
that
he
necessarily
sent
the
only
copy
of
the
strain
to
Ft.
Detrick
.
Senator
Patrick
Leahy
at
a
Congressional
hearing
in
the
Spring
of
2002
noted
that
the
FBI
had
collected
the
Ames
strain
from
20
sources
.
In
Fall
2004
,
MSNBC
,
relying
on
an
unnamed
FBI
spokesperson
,
reports
that
the
FBI
has
narrowed
the
pool
of
labs
known
to
have
had
Ames
that
was
a
match
from
16
to
4
but
can
not
rule
out
that
it
was
made
overseas
.
Al
Qaeda
's
anthrax
production
plans
on
Khalid
Mohammed
's
computer
did
not
evidence
knowledge
of
advanced
techniques
in
the
most
efficient
biological
weapons
.
At
least
according
to
the
public
comments
by
bioweaponeer
experts
William
Patrick
and
Kenneth
Alibek
,
under
the
optimal
method
,
there
is
no
electrostatic
charge
.
In
the
case
of
the
anthrax
used
in
the
mailings
,
there
was
an
electrostatic
charge
.
Although
there
was
a
dominance
of
single
spores
and
a
trillion
spore
concentration
,
there
were
clumps
as
large
as
40
-
100
microns
.
(
Spores
must
be
no
bigger
than
5
microns
to
be
inhalable
.
)
Many
point
to
the
trillion
spore
concentration
as
extraordinary
.
It
is
far
simpler
,
however
,
to
achieve
a
trillion
spore
concentration
in
the
production
of
a
few
grams
than
in
industrial
processing
typical
of
a
state
sponsored
lab
.
The
"
trillion
spore
"
issue
was
at
the
heart
of
a
lot
of
mistaken
theories
of
the
matter
concluding
that
state
sponsorship
was
necessarily
indicated
.
The
reported
finding
at
Dugway
undermines
the
argument
of
both
the
"
bomb
Iraq
"
crowd
and
the
liberals
focused
on
Dr.
Steve
Hatfill
who
object
to
US
biodefense
research
because
they
view
it
as
being
useful
for
offensive
purposes
.
USDA
employee
Johnelle
Bryant
first
told
us
,
in
sensational
detail
,
of
Atta
's
inquiries
about
purchasing
and
retrofitting
a
cropduster
.
Khalid
Mohammed
then
told
interrogators
that
Zacarias
Moussaoui
's
inquiries
about
crop
dusting
may
have
related
to
Yazid
Sufaat
's
anthrax
manufacturing
plans
.
Although
the
details
of
the
documents
on
Mohammed
's
computer
may
(
or
may
not
)
point
to
possible
difficulties
in
aerial
dispersal
,
they
are
fully
consistent
with
the
product
used
in
the
anthrax
mailings
.
Al
Qaeda
had
both
the
means
and
opportunity
.
US
-
trained
Malaysian
biochemist
Yazid
Sufaat
met
with
9/11
plotters
and
two
hijackers
in
January
2000
.
Sufaat
was
a
member
of
Al
Qaeda
and
a
member
of
Jemaah
Islamiah
(
"
JI
"
)
.
JI
has
ties
with
the
Moro
Front
.
Sufaat
used
his
company
called
Green
Laboratory
Medicine
to
buy
items
useful
to
Al
Qaeda
.
(
Green
symbolizes
"
Islam
"
and
Prophet
Mohammed
's
holy
war
)
.
Zacarias
Moussaoui
,
who
had
a
crop
dusting
manual
when
he
was
arrested
,
stayed
at
Sufaat
's
condominium
in
2000
when
he
was
trying
to
arrange
for
flight
lessons
in
Malaysia
.
Yazid
Sufaat
provided
Moussaoui
with
a
letter
indicating
that
he
was
a
marketing
representative
for
Infocus
Technologies
and
allegedly
provided
him
$
35,000
.
The
crop
dusters
were
to
be
part
of
a
"
second
wave
.
"
After
9/11
,
Yazid
Sufaat
traveled
to
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
to
work
for
the
Taliban
Medical
Brigade
and
to
continue
his
work
with
anthrax
.
As
described
in
US
News
,
a
former
reporter
from
the
Kabul
Times
actually
may
have
met
Sufaat
,
without
realizing
it
,
while
traveling
near
Kabul
in
October
2001
,
perceiving
him
as
Filipino
.
The
fellow
was
carrying
papers
from
Zawahiri
and
bragging
about
his
ability
to
manipulate
anthrax
.
Sufaat
was
arrested
in
December
2001
upon
his
return
to
Malaysia
.
Newsweek
reported
that
a
"
second
wave
"
involving
biological
attacks
had
been
thwarted
upon
the
arrest
of
Al
Qaeda
members
who
had
been
intended
to
provide
logistical
support
.
Various
doctors
,
both
foreign
and
American
,
are
associated
with
Al
Qaeda
leaders
or
operatives
,
to
include
the
doctors
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
,
a
bacteriologist
from
Rawalpindi
and
Aafia
Siddiqui
,
PhD
,
from
Karachi
.
Microbiologist
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
was
charged
along
with
his
son
,
Ahmed
,
for
harboring
the
fugitives
.
As
of
March
28
,
2003
,
he
was
in
a
hospital
for
a
cardiac
problem
and
had
been
granted
"
pre-arrest
bail
.
"
Yet
all
you
read
about
at
the
time
was
the
arrest
of
the
son
Ahmed
Abdul
Qadoos
,
who
receives
a
stipend
from
the
UN
for
being
officially
low
-
IQ
due
to
lead
poisoning
.
It
was
Khalid
Mohammed
who
told
authorities
about
Aafia
Siddiqui
,
who
has
a
PhD
from
Brandeis
in
neurology
.
The
Pakistani
press
reported
that
she
was
nabbed
in
Karachi
after
being
spotted
at
the
airport
in
late
March
or
early
April
2003
.
If
mistaken
,
how
did
those
reports
first
come
about
?
Understandably
,
Amerithrax
is
a
confidential
investigation
.
The
Pakistan
ISI
and
CIA
rarely
grant
press
interviews
in
connection
with
an
ongoing
manhunt
.
The
CIA
did
not
even
allow
the
FBI
access
to
KSM
for
10
days
after
his
arrest
.
As
agent
Van
Harp
,
then
head
of
the
Amerithrax
investigation
said
,
the
information
coming
from
Khalid
Mohammed
is
classified
with
the
authorities
releasing
only
certain
limited
information
.
While
it
's
not
easy
to
separate
fact
from
fiction
,
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
and
Director
Mueller
have
publicly
confirmed
Aafia
is
still
being
sought
.
They
would
know
.
Her
mother
Ismat
last
saw
Aafia
and
her
grandchildren
before
they
left
in
a
minicab
at
the
end
of
March
.
Aafia
was
on
her
way
with
her
children
to
visit
and
uncle
and
a
friend
in
Islamabad
.
According
to
the
Pakistan
reports
,
Aafia
Siddiqui
was
detained
after
being
spotted
at
Karachi
International
airport
(
after
she
was
followed
to
a
relative
's
house
)
.
(
Karachi
is
in
the
south
)
.
The
reports
say
she
is
suspected
of
having
been
a
member
of
Al
Qaeda
's
"
Chemical
Wire
Group
.
"
The
family
's
lawyer
advises
me
that
Aafia
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
airfare
tickets
for
herself
and
the
kids
and
called
Ismat
from
the
train
station
.
That
was
the
last
Ismat
heard
from
her
.
Aafia
never
reached
the
uncle
's
house
.
Perhaps
something
got
lost
in
the
translation
,
but
the
phrase
"
Chemical
Wire
Group
"
has
appeared
in
all
the
english
Pakistan
and
India
papers
.
The
family
's
attorney
advises
me
that
Aafia
had
no
knowledge
of
chemicals
(
and
that
would
not
appear
to
be
her
training
)
.
There
still
is
a
very
hot
pursuit
of
the
"
Atta
-
level
"
Floridian
,
Adnan
El
Shukrijumah
,
who
Siddiqui
is
thought
to
have
known
and
been
assisting
.
His
nickname
is
"
Jafar
the
Pilot
.
"
A
senior
DOJ
official
reports
that
Adnan
has
experience
as
a
commercial
pilot
.
He
is
said
by
one
FBI
agent
to
be
"
very
,
very
,
very
"
dangerous
.
He
allegedly
was
at
one
or
more
meetings
in
the
Summer
of
2001
in
Pakistan
at
which
KSM
and
Sufaat
were
present
.
He
may
have
been
seen
in
Hamilton
,
Canada
--
along
with
Egyptian
al
-
Maati
,
who
apparently
also
has
received
pilot
training
.
The
United
States
truly
no
longer
has
time
for
faulty
analysis
or
politically
-
based
preconceptions
.
In
early
June
2003
,
a
CIA
report
concluded
that
the
reason
for
Atta
's
and
Zacarias
Moussaoui
's
inquiries
into
cropdusters
was
in
fact
for
the
contemplated
use
in
dispersing
biological
agents
such
as
anthrax
.
It
has
long
been
known
Osama
Bin
Laden
was
interested
in
using
cropdusters
to
disperse
biological
agents
(
since
the
testimony
of
millennium
bomber
Ahmed
Ressam
)
.
The
hijacker
Ahmed
Alhaznawi
appears
to
have
contracted
cutaneous
anthrax
in
Afghanistan
.
It
is
reasonable
to
credit
his
statement
that
he
got
the
lesion
after
bumping
into
a
suitcase
he
was
carrying
at
a
camp
in
Afghanistan
.
The
lesion
is
further
evidence
of
Al
Qaeda
's
anthrax
production
program
at
Kandahar
.
The
present
evidence
relating
to
Atta
's
alleged
travel
to
Prague
does
not
warrant
a
conclusion
that
Al
Qaeda
obtained
the
Ames
strain
from
Iraq
.
Iraq
,
however
,
remains
a
possible
source
of
the
Ames
.
Former
Russian
bioweaponeer
Ken
Alibek
has
said
that
a
key
Russian
scientist
assisted
Iraq
and
that
Russia
had
the
Ames
strain
.
(
His
conclusion
may
have
been
based
on
the
fake
mobile
biolab
plans
foisted
upon
the
US
by
the
Chalabi
associate
"
Curveball
"
,
which
Alibek
divined
to
be
identical
to
Russian
mobile
lab
design
)
.
Zawahiri
did
travel
to
Baghdad
in
1998
with
an
entourage
to
attend
the
birthday
party
of
Saddam
's
son
.
The
papers
found
at
headquarters
of
the
Mukhabarat
,
Iraq
's
secret
police
,
show
that
an
entourage
from
Al
Qaeda
group
was
sent
to
the
Iraqi
capital
in
March
1998
from
Sudan
.
According
to
at
least
some
reports
,
Bin
Laden
rejected
the
suggestion
of
a
closer
alliance
--
preferring
to
pursue
his
own
concept
of
jihad
.
Two
top
Iraqi
scientists
,
code
named
Charlie
and
Alpha
,
are
helping
the
coalition
to
learn
more
about
Iraqi
's
anthrax
program
,
according
to
Dr.
David
Kay
,
head
of
the
Iraq
survey
group
in
charge
of
the
hunt
for
WMD
.
He
has
said
that
the
Iraqis
made
surprising
innovations
in
the
milling
and
drying
processes
needed
to
weaponize
anthrax
.
The
media
coverage
has
been
seriously
confused
on
the
issue
of
motive
and
the
reason
Senators
Daschle
and
Leahy
would
have
been
targeted
--
tending
to
simplistically
view
them
as
"
liberals
.
"
Zawahiri
likely
targeted
Senators
Daschle
and
Leahy
to
receive
anthrax
letters
,
in
addition
to
various
media
outlets
,
because
of
the
appropriations
made
pursuant
to
the
"
Leahy
Law
"
to
military
and
security
forces
.
That
money
has
prevented
the
militant
islamists
from
achieving
their
goals
.
Al
Qaeda
members
and
sympathizers
feel
that
the
FBI
's
involvement
in
countries
like
Egypt
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
Pakistan
,
Indonesia
,
and
the
Philippines
interferes
with
the
sovereignty
of
those
countries
.
According
to
a
post
she
made
on
the
internet
,
Aafia
Siddiqui
expressed
the
same
sentiment
in
connection
with
US
appropriations
sought
in
exchange
for
the
extradition
of
WTC
1993
plotter
Ramzi
Yousef
from
Pakistan
.
Senator
Leahy
was
Chairman
of
both
the
Judiciary
Committee
overseeing
the
FBI
and
Appropriations
Subcommittee
in
charge
of
foreign
aid
to
these
countries
.
In
late
September
2001
,
it
was
announced
that
the
President
was
seeking
a
blanket
waiver
that
would
lift
all
restrictions
on
aid
to
military
and
security
units
in
connection
with
pursuing
the
militant
islamists
.
This
extradition
and
imprisonment
of
Al
Qaeda
leaders
,
along
with
US
support
for
Israel
and
the
Mubarak
government
in
Egypt
,
remains
foremost
in
the
mind
of
Dr.
Zawahiri
.
At
the
height
of
the
development
of
his
biological
weapons
program
,
his
brother
was
extradited
pursuant
to
a
death
sentence
in
the
"
Albanian
returnees
"
case
(
now
he
faces
retrial
)
.
It
's
hard
to
keep
up
with
the
stories
about
billion
dollar
appropriations
,
debt
forgiveness
,
and
loan
guarantees
to
countries
like
Egypt
and
Israel
and
now
even
Pakistan
.
Those
appropriations
pale
in
comparison
to
the
many
tens
of
billions
in
appropriations
relating
to
the
invasion
of
Iraq
.
Al
Qaeda
had
a
motive
in
mind
.
In
his
Fall
2001
book
titled
Knights
under
the
Banner
of
the
Prophet
,
Zawahiri
argued
that
the
secular
press
was
telling
"
lies
"
about
the
militant
islamists
--
to
include
the
suggestion
that
the
militant
islamists
were
somehow
the
creation
of
the
United
States
in
connection
with
expelling
the
Russians
from
Afghanistan
.
Zawahiri
argued
instead
that
they
have
been
active
since
the
assassination
of
Anwar
Sadat
in
Egypt
because
of
the
Camp
David
Accord
and
the
resulting
peace
treaty
between
Egypt
and
Israel
.
The
anthrax
letters
were
sent
on
the
date
of
the
Camp
David
Accord
and
then
the
date
Anwar
Sadat
was
assassinated
as
if
to
underscore
the
point
to
anyone
paying
attention
.
Most
of
the
"
talking
heads
"
on
television
,
however
,
knew
only
that
Daschle
and
Leahy
were
liberal
democrats
and
did
not
know
anything
of
Al
Qaeda
beyond
what
they
read
in
the
US
newspapers
.
The
FBI
's
profile
includes
a
US
-
based
supporter
of
the
militant
islamists
.
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
explained
that
an
"
either
-
or
"
approach
is
not
useful
.
The
media
has
tended
to
overlook
the
fact
that
when
the
FBI
uses
the
word
"
domestic
"
the
word
includes
a
US
-
based
,
highly
-
educated
supporter
of
the
militant
islamists
.
There
is
an
emerging
consensus
that
anthrax
was
contained
in
a
letter
to
AMI
,
the
publisher
of
the
National
Enquirer
--
in
a
goofy
love
letter
to
Jennifer
Lopez
enclosing
a
Star
of
David
and
proposing
marriage
.
A
report
by
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
of
interviews
with
AMI
employees
(
as
well
as
detailed
interviews
by
author
Leonard
Cole
)
supports
the
conclusion
that
there
were
not
one
,
but
two
,
such
mailings
containing
anthrax
.
(
The
letters
were
to
different
AMI
publications
--
one
to
the
National
Enquirer
and
another
to
The
Sun
)
.
(
News
assistant
Bobby
Bender
recalls
the
letter
containing
the
items
to
have
been
addressed
to
The
Sun
.
)
This
tactic
of
letters
is
not
merely
the
modus
operandi
of
these
militant
islamists
inspired
by
Zawahiri
,
it
is
their
signature
.
The
islamists
sent
letter
bombs
in
January
1997
to
newspaper
offices
in
New
York
City
and
Washington
,
D.C.
.
They
were
sent
in
connection
with
the
earlier
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
blind
sheik
,
Sheik
Abdel
Rahman
.
The
former
leader
of
the
Egyptian
Al
-
Gamaa
al
-
Islamiya
(
"
Islamic
Group
"
)
,
he
was
also
a
spiritual
leader
of
Al
Qaeda
.
The
letter
bombs
were
sent
in
connection
with
the
treatment
of
the
Egyptian
islamists
imprisoned
for
the
earlier
attack
on
the
WTC
and
a
related
plot
.
The
purpose
of
the
letter
bombs
--
which
resulted
in
minimal
casualty
--
was
to
send
a
message
.
(
There
initially
was
an
outstanding
$
2
million
reward
--
under
the
rewards
for
justice
program
,
the
reward
now
is
up
to
$
5
million
.
)
.
There
was
no
claim
of
responsibility
.
There
was
no
explanation
.
Once
one
had
been
received
,
the
next
ten
,
mailed
on
two
separate
dates
,
were
easily
collected
.
Sound
familiar
?
Two
bombs
were
also
sent
to
Leavenworth
,
where
a
key
WTC
1993
defendant
was
imprisoned
,
addressed
to
"
Parole
Officer
.
"
(
The
position
does
not
exist
)
.
Abdel
Rahman
's
son
was
captured
in
Quetta
,
Pakistan
in
mid-February
2003
.
That
arrest
in
turn
led
to
the
dramatic
capture
of
Khalid
Mohammed
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
3
.
Mohammed
allegedly
was
hiding
in
the
home
of
the
Pakistani
bacteriologist
Dr.
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
.
Along
with
Zawahiri
,
Abdel
Rahman
and
his
two
sons
have
had
considerable
influence
over
Bin
Laden
.
He
reportedly
treated
them
like
sons
.
Although
while
in
jail
in
the
early
1980s
,
Zawahiri
caused
considerable
tension
by
challenging
the
blind
sheik
's
ability
to
lead
a
coalition
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
and
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
,
Zawahiri
and
OBL
are
Rahman
's
friends
.
The
imprisoned
WTC
1993
plotter
Yousef
was
KSM
's
nephew
.
Thus
,
the
leaders
in
charge
of
Al
Qaeda
's
anthrax
production
program
had
a
close
connection
to
those
imprisoned
in
connection
with
the
earlier
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
.
According
to
the
controversial
"
Feith
memo
,
"
which
summarized
purported
intelligence
showing
an
Iraqi
/
Al
Qaeda
connection
,
Osama
Bin
Laden
had
asked
Iraqi
intelligence
for
technical
assistance
in
sending
letter
bombs
a
half
year
before
the
Al
Hayat
letters
were
sent
.
Just
because
Al
Qaeda
likes
its
truck
bombs
and
the
like
to
be
effective
does
not
mean
they
do
not
see
the
value
in
a
deadly
missive
.
As
Brian
Jenkins
once
said
,
"
terrorism
is
theater
.
"
A
sender
purporting
to
be
islamist
sent
cyanide
in
both
early
2002
and
early
2003
in
New
Zealand
and
ingredients
of
nerve
gas
in
Belgium
in
2003
.
There
's
even
a
chapter
titled
"
Poisonous
Letter
"
in
the
Al
Qaeda
manual
.
The
"
Federal
Eagle
"
stamp
used
in
the
anthrax
mailings
was
a
blue
-
green
.
It
was
widely
published
among
the
militant
islamists
that
martyrs
go
to
paradise
"
in
the
hearts
of
green
birds
.
"
In
the
very
interview
in
which
they
admitted
9/11
,
and
described
the
codes
used
for
the
four
targets
for
the
planes
,
the
masterminds
admitted
to
the
Jenny
code
,
the
code
for
representing
the
date
9/11
,
and
used
the
symbolism
of
the
"
Green
Birds
.
"
Osama
Bin
Laden
later
invoked
the
symbolism
in
his
video
"
The
19
Martyrs
.
"
A
FAQ
on
the
Azzam
Publications
website
explained
that
"
In
the
Hearts
of
Green
Birds
"
refers
to
what
is
inside
.
The
mailer
's
use
of
"
Greendale
School
"
as
the
return
address
for
the
letters
to
the
Senators
is
also
revealing
.
A
May
2001
letter
that
Zawahiri
sent
to
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
members
abroad
establish
that
Zawahiri
used
"
school
"
as
a
code
word
for
the
Egyptian
militant
islamists
in
his
correspondence
.
Green
symbolizes
Islam
and
was
the
Prophet
Mohammed
's
color
.
By
Greendale
School
,
the
anthrax
perp
was
being
cute
,
just
as
Yazid
Sufaat
was
being
cute
in
naming
his
lab
Green
Laboratory
Medicine
.
Dale
means
"
river
valley
.
"
Greendale
likely
refers
to
green
river
valley
--
i.e.
,
Cairo
's
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
or
the
Islamic
Group
.
The
sender
probably
is
announcing
that
he
is
of
either
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
,
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
or
Jihad
-
al
Qaeda
,
which
is
actually
the
full
name
of
the
group
after
the
merger
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
and
al
Qaeda
.
At
the
Darunta
complex
where
jihadis
trained
,
recruits
would
wear
green
uniforms
,
except
for
Friday
when
they
were
washed
.
In
a
Hadith
the
Messenger
of
Allah
explains
that
the
souls
of
the
martyrs
are
in
the
hearts
of
green
birds
that
fly
wherever
they
please
in
the
Paradise
.
As
to
opportunity
,
though
seldom
reported
,
there
is
a
wealth
of
"
open
source
"
information
about
possible
Al
Qaeda
or
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
or
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
.
The
public
information
mostly
relates
to
those
suspected
sleepers
who
have
been
detained
or
who
are
at
large
and
are
being
sought
.
Zawahiri
's
mission
in
the
United
States
in
1995
was
to
do
spadework
for
terrorism
,
not
fundraising
for
charitable
causes
.
He
traveled
under
an
alias
and
was
accompanied
by
a
former
US
Army
sergeant
named
Ali
Mohammed
.
What
mosques
exactly
did
they
visit
and
who
did
they
meet
?
Whatever
your
political
persuasion
,
the
FBI
and
CIA
deserve
our
support
.
We
are
,
after
all
,
in
this
together
.
First
,
the
nature
of
such
an
investigation
is
that
we
lack
sufficient
information
to
second
-
guess
(
or
even
know
)
what
the
FBI
is
doing
.
Media
reports
are
a
poor
approximation
of
reality
because
of
the
lack
of
good
sources
.
Second
,
hindsight
is
20
/
20
.
Third
,
with
the
"
new
age
"
Efrem
Zimbalist
,
Jr.
in
charge
of
the
investigation
,
it
is
not
likely
we
could
do
better
in
striking
the
appropriate
balance
between
due
process
and
national
security
.
Finally
,
the
"
Hatfill
theory
"
seems
to
have
been
exhausted
or
at
least
lost
public
favor
.
The
"
Hatfill
theory
"
accusing
Dr.
Stephen
Hatfill
was
always
highly
dubious
.
The
suspicion
was
founded
on
many
false
premises
,
and
there
was
no
reliable
publicly
known
evidence
indicating
his
guilt
.
The
FBI
's
fixation
on
Hatfill
(
at
least
as
rumored
by
some
reporters
)
may
have
stemmed
from
a
warning
by
one
Senator
that
careers
hung
in
the
balance
.
Leahy
's
chief
of
staff
apparently
started
with
the
strong
predisposition
that
some
right
-
winger
was
involved
because
two
liberal
democrats
had
been
targeted
.
The
Hatfill
theory
--
to
include
ongoing
interviews
and
ongoing
7
/
24
surveillance
by
8
surveillance
specialists
--
is
now
the
subject
of
pending
civil
rights
and
libel
claims
of
uncertain
merit
.
A
suit
against
the
New
York
Times
and
columnist
Nicholas
Kristof
was
dismissed
in
late
November
2004
.
The
judge
had
agreed
to
delay
the
civil
rights
matter
from
proceeding
until
at
least
October
2004
.
The
judge
,
frustrated
by
the
apparent
lack
of
progress
,
encouraged
that
the
parties
reach
a
negotiated
compromise
that
would
permit
some
limited
discovery
to
proceed
(
and
the
judge
has
directed
that
the
government
to
file
an
Answer
to
the
Complaint
)
.
The
Hatfill
Theory
ironically
might
best
be
understood
as
an
Al
Qaeda
theory
,
with
a
coincidental
Malaysian
connection
adding
to
the
other
circumstances
.
Given
the
regrettable
leaks
that
he
was
under
suspicion
,
it
is
only
fair
that
the
FBI
leak
with
equal
enthusiasm
the
fact
that
Dr.
Hatfill
has
now
been
dropped
as
a
suspect
if
and
when
that
proves
to
be
the
case
.
A
search
of
Dr.
Ken
Berry
's
residences
likely
will
prove
just
about
the
last
gasp
of
a
biodefense
insider
theory
.
Senior
officials
have
been
quoted
in
the
press
as
saying
that
the
searches
were
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
him
as
much
as
including
him
.
Maureen
,
Andre
is
going
to
look
over
the
list
of
curves
needed
for
the
global
assets
(
August
Board
meeting
)
one
more
time
before
I
forward
it
to
you
.
He
will
make
sure
that
we
do
not
request
FX
and
inflation
(
CPI
,
PPI
,
etc.
)
curves
when
only
one
of
the
curves
will
actually
be
used
in
the
valuation
process
and
to
determine
which
inflation
index
is
needed
.
Typically
,
we
receive
both
FX
and
inflation
from
you
,
but
both
curves
may
not
always
be
used
.
I
hope
that
we
can
give
you
some
time
savings
by
eliminating
any
nonessential
requests
.
For
now
,
this
is
the
list
of
countries
for
which
we
will
probably
need
the
FX
and
/
or
inflation
curves
.
I
will
send
the
specifics
per
Andre
later
today
.
India
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto
Rico
CPI
only
(
I
need
historical
inflation
data
,
as
well
)
Panama
Brazil
we
have
current
data
already
China
we
have
current
data
already
Euro
inflation
only
I
am
not
certain
about
the
needs
for
the
London
Underwriting
/
IV
group
but
will
request
the
information
from
them
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
.
Thanks
!
Cindy
David
and
Cindy
,
Please
send
us
the
list
of
the
curves
that
you
will
need
to
revalue
our
international
assets
for
the
August
Board
meeting
.
Thanks
,
Maureen
Philip
,
I
have
to
decline
the
invitation
with
regrets
.
I

too
many

We
are
aiming
to
have
the
programme
printed

at
this
year
's

.
I

for
the
Round
Table
Friday
night
(

.
See

all
there
-
this

Paula
FYI
Vince
Anne
,
Mike
will
call
you
regarding
Sarah
.
Vince
,
As
I
mentioned
in
my
voice
mail
,
Mike
Roberts
going
to
hire
Sara
Woody
,
a
recent
MBA
grad
from
Rice
,
into
his
group
.
However
,
when
we
were
talking
about
this
position
,
Mike
compared
Sara
to
Elena
.
Elena
's
title
is
admin
coordinator
,
and
I
know
that
Sara
should
not
have
this
title
,
and
honestly
do
not
think
that
Elena
should
also
.
Admin
coordinator's
do
primarily
administrative
work
.
I
suggest
that
you
compare
Elena
and
Sarah
's
duties
/
level
to
other
Sr.
Spec.
in
your
group
such
as
Kenneth
Parkhill
and
Sevil
to
determine
if
they
are
equivalent
,
or
if
their
scope
of
responsibilities
and
experience
is
not
as
broad
.
If
the
latter
is
the
case
,
we
could
place
both
Sara
and
Elena
in
a
specialist
job
group
(
the
salary
range
is
33
-
66
K
)
.
Please
advise
.
Thanks
,
Anne
Clayton
,
Thanks
a
lot
.
I
appreciate
all
your
help
.
Vince
Vince

Good
news

Martin
's
box
is
working
wonderfully
-
I
'll
have
everything
transferred
to
it
and
give
him
the
keys
by
Friday
.
This
was
(
another
)
nice
deal
for
Enron
.
We
save
$
21,000
in
real
money
this
way
,
the
cash
refund
Sun
is
giving
Enron
for
our
other
server
,
using
a
box
that
was
n't
being
used
by
anyone
.
I
'm
happy
about
this
.
Clayton
Iris

Congratulations

Anne
,
please
,

Vince
Michael
:
Thanks
for
putting
the
paperwork
together
.
I
would
have
interest
in
meeting
if
you
can
present
unique
investment
opportunities
that
I
do
n't
have
access
to
now
.
Most
of
my
contact
with
financial
advisors
in
the
past
has
consisted
of
them
suggesting
a
mutual
fund
,
telling
me
to
invest
in
Home
Depot
,
Sun
,
and
Coke
,
or
trying
to
pass
off
their
banks
'
biased
research
reports
as
something
valuable
.
The
above
services
provide
no
value
to
me
personally
.
If
you
can
present
opportunities
such
as
access
to
private
equity
or
hedge
funds
,
or
other
ideas
with
strong
growth
potential
and
low
correlation
to
the
S@P
,
I
'd
listen
.
John
John
-
We
'll
get
the
paperwork
together
and
sent
to
you
for
naked
options
.
At
some
point
,
I
'd
like
to
talk
about
the
diversification
strategy
in
more
detail
--
perhaps
over
dinner
or
a
quick
meeting
after
the
markets
close
?

Michael

Appreciate
the
idea
.
However
,
with
my
natural
long
,
I
'm
not
looking
to
really
trade
around
the
position
.
I
believe
ENE
will
continue
to
be
range
bound
,
but
in
case
it
is
not
,
I
do
n't
want
to
forgo
50
%
of
my
option
premium
.
I
have
price
targets
of
where
I
would
like
to
lighten
up
exposure
to
ENE
and
will
use
calls
to
implement
the
stategy
.
To
that
regards
,
I
noticed
I
was
not
approved
to
sell
naked
calls
.
I
would
like
that
ability
in
order
to
hedge
some
exposure
I
have
of
unexercised
vested
options
.
Please
look
into
that
for
me
.
John
.
John
-
I
was
looking
at
the
recent
pullback
in
ENE
and
thinking
it
might
be
an
opportunity
to
buy
back
the
calls
you
sold
.
Of
course
,
you
would
then
be
in
a
position
to
sell
calls
again
if
the
stock
makes
a
bounce
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
ENE
@
75
is
the
place
,
but
maybe
@
73
.
Call
me
if
you
're
interested
.

and
everything
.
My
only
concern
is
that
we
take
the
boys
away
from
their
overwhelming
task
.
What
do
you
guys
think

Did

Thanks

John
Lavorato
has
requested
the
attached
report
.
He
is
concerned
about
the
allocation
amongst
categories
-
in
particular
,
Real
Time
Traders
.
If
you
would
,
please
review
the
entire
list
and
let
me
know
if
you
are
in
agreement
with
the
presentation
by
tomorrow
evening
,
if
possible
.
I
'm
at
x
if
you
have
any
questions
.
Thanks
!
I
understand
all
of
those
comparisons
,
however
,
the
reality
is
if
we
lose
Dean
(
which
we
will
if
we
do
n't
pay
65
k
+
10
k
)
,
we
will
end
up
hiring
a
replacement
at
75
-
80
k
.
This
is
pretty
easy
math
for
me
.
I
know
it
seems
like
a
stretch
,
but
the
market
for
hourly
traders
is
very
strong
right
now
.
I
would
like
to
get
this
done
ASAP
.
Thanks
.
I
am
reviewing
the
request
for
an
employment
agreement
renewal
on
Mark
Dean
Laurent
.
Juan
communicated
some
numbers
to
me
and
when
reviewing
this

would
like
to
ask
you
to
consider
the
following
:
Current

Original

signing
Revised
Proposal
:

Salary
:

k
1
Year
agreement
$
5,000
signing
Business
Case
:
If
we
offered
Dean
55
k
or
60
k
it
would
still
constitute
a
over
a
$
10,000
increase
(
approximately
25
%
)
and
taking
into
consideration
he
was
rated
as
satisfactory
at
the
specialist
level
.
Also
,
the
top
of
the
salary
range
for
a
specialist
is
66
k
.
It
would
still
give
him
room
to
progress
in
the
current
job
group
should
he
not
be
promoted
.
Secondly
,
he
will
still
out
price
performers
that
you
have
in
the

that
are
excellent

a

SAP
,
nor
Hyperion
.
The
2000

has
no
income
,
assets
,
or
liabilities
.
There
is
a
corporate
data
sheet
for
this
company
,
but
this
entity
seems
to
have
been
inactive
since
it
's
creation
.
86M
-
Enron
Net
Works
LLC
Despite
the
name
,
this
entity
appears
to
be
a
MTM
company
.
Per
September
financials
,
this
company
has
about
$
3
M
of
MTM
and
about
$
8
K
of
expenses
,
nothing
else
.
The
next
5
companies
were
my
responsibility
while
in

,
and
did
not
get
assigned

the

.

was
created
in

for
the
acquistion

(
now
Enron

,
Inc.
83N
)
,
and
then
dissolved
upon
completion
of
merger
.
Company
is
around
with
a
small
amount
of
assets
and
liabilities
,
but
no
I/S
items
.
83N
is
my
responsibility
.
I
think
this
entity
should
stay
with
83N
.
So
I
suggest
it
be
assigned
to
Leon
.
It
should
be
4

1579
-
EBS
Network

This
one
should
possibly
be
assigned

Not
currently
on
our
list
of
companies
.
I
think
this
could
go
to
either
Holding

Administrative
Companies
(
Same
as
17H
)
or
Network

(

(
1179
)
was
assigned
to
Commodity

Maybe
this
one
should
also
go

would
be

Virginia

Hello
.
I
was
originally
inquiring
about
purchasing
a
Cross
or
Signac
impressionist
lithograph
.
I
found
them
and
purchased
both
from
a
gallery
in
London
,
William
Weston
.
They
should
be
delivered
this
week
.
They
are
beautiful
and
will
add
a
lot
to
our
collection
.
By
the
way
the
Lichtenstein
is
up
and
hanging
in
our
formal
living
room
and
it
is
magnificent
.
I
have
also
purchased
an
Appel
in
the
last
month
.
I
am
interested
in
several
artists
.
Actually
,
a
lot
.
I
will
be
looking
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
.
My
concept
is
that
over
time
I
would
like
to
own
one
of
all
the
following
artists
and
they
are
all
depending
when
I
find
something
that
we
really
like
.
I
listed
all
of
our
(
sometimes
mine
vs.
my
wife
's
favorites
and
priorities
)
.
They
are
kind
of
in
rank
order
but
as
I
stated
if
I
find
the
piece
that
I
like
we
will
purchase
it
.
I
want
signed
and
numbered
.
I
realize
that
some
were
not
signed
by
the
artist
but
it
is
an
important
fact
in
my
buying
decision
.
I
also
realize
that
some
may
not
have
done
any
works
on
paper
or
they
are
outrageously
expensive
.
For
example
,
I
would
like
to
know
if
Rothko
or
Kline
did
any
work
on
paper
.
At
least
that
is
what
I
am
thinking
now
.
Bonnard
(
colorful
only
)
Lautrec
Suerat
(
any
works
on
paper
?
-
I
do
n't
know
that
he
did
any
)
Other
impressionist
or
post
impressionist
lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell
By
the
way
,
I
am
interested
in
re-looking
at
a
Picasso
(
although
we
have
2
)
that
your
gallery
had
a
couple
of
years
ago
.
It
was
a
cubist
piece
from
the
1920s
and
I
believe
you
called
the
technique
a
"
push
wa
"
(
pronunciation
Vs
an
attempt
at
the
proper
spelling
)
.
It
was
for
sale
in
a
couple
of
galleries
in
SF
and
was
about
$
20,000
.
Is
there
1
available
?
Also
I
am
still
thinking
about
the
Matisse
we
discussed
before
but
as
you
can
see
,
I
have
a
lot
of
other
artists
I
am
interested
in
and
it
may
remain
on
the
back
burner
because
we
already
have
one
.

I
'll

I

I

I
will
probably
be
doing
lunch
but
just
do
n't
be

It
is

I
have
a
couple
of
questions
so
I
can
wrap
up
the
LOI
:
We
refer
to
licensed
Fuel
Cell
Energy
equipment
.
Do
we
intend
to
reference
a
particular
manufacturer
,
or
should
this
be
more
generic
?
Do
we
want
to
attach
a
draft
of
the
Development
Agreement
,
and
condition
the
final
deal
on
agreeing
to
terms
substantially
the
same
as
what
's
in

draft
?
I
have
a
concern
that
the
Enron
optionality
bug
could
bite
us
on
the
backside
with
that
one

Do
we
expect
to
have
ONE
EPC
contract
,
or
several
?
I
'm
looking
for
the
confidentiality
agreement
,
which
may
be
in

Forget
the
ONE
or
more
contract
questions
.
I
see
we
expect
to
have
separate
contracts
for
each
project
.
I
have
a
couple
of
questions
so
I
can
wrap
up
the
LOI
:
We
refer
to
licensed
Fuel
Cell
Energy
equipment
.
Do
we
intend
to
reference
a
particular
manufacturer
,
or
should
this
be
more
generic
?
Do
we
want
to
attach
a
draft
of
the
Development
Agreement
,
and
condition
the
final
deal
on
agreeing
to
terms
substantially
the
same
as
what
's
in
the
draft
?

On
the
issue
of
the
contracts
,
the
draft
says
that
the
$
170
m
is
paid
when
the
EPC
contract
is
signed
.
Are
we
expecting
that
the
portion
attributable
to
each
project
will
be
paid
as
the
individual
EPC
contracts
are
signed
?
Thanks

Kay

.
The
pricing
that
we
have
given
CRRA
is
specific
to
FuelCell
Energy
and
would
not
be
meaningful
without
listing
the
manufacturer
(
i.e.
,
ONSI
would
be
a
lot
more
money
)
.
Hence
,
I
think
that
we
have
to
reference
the
manufacturer
.

.
The
attachment
of
the
Development
Agreement
is
a
Jeff
question
.
In
order
to
mark
any
2000
income
,
we
will
need
to
get
CRRA
to
execute
the
Development
Agreement
in
2000
.
In
my
opinion
,
we
should
show
CRRA
a
copy
of
the
LOI
with
the
assumption
that
the
Development
Agreement
is
attached
.
I
would
actually
send
them
the
draft
Development
Agreement
a
couple
days
after
the
LOI
.
Based
on
how
CRRA
reacts
,
I
would
make
an
ultimate
determination
if
the
agreement
needs
to
be
attached
to
the
LOI
.
3
.
I
expect
at
least
one
EPC
contract
per
project
.
We
do
n't
want
to
condition
the
acceptance
of
one
project
on
the
performance
of
another
project
.
Performance
tests
will
either
be
performed
on
a
project
basis
or
a
unit
by
unit
basis
in
a
given
project
.
Remarkably
clear
explanation

Yo

Your

is
so
fat
:
When
she
hauls
ass
she
has
to
make
two
trips
.
When
she
dances
she
makes
the
band
skip
.
When
she
was
diagnosed
with
the
flesh
eating
disease
the
doctor
gave
her
13
years
to
live
.
She
puts
mayonnaise
on
aspirin
.
(
<-
clearly
the
winner
)
Her
cereal
bowl
came
with
a
lifeguard
.
When
she
goes
to
the
zoo
the
elephants
throw
her
peanuts
.
Her
high
school
graduation
picture
was
an
aerial
photograph
.
Her
driver
`s
license
says
"
Picture
continued
on
other
side
.
"
She
has
to
iron
her
pants
on
the
driveway
.
The
back
of
her
neck
looks
like
a
pack
of
hot
dogs
.
Yo

all
the
restaurants
in

have

that
say
:
"

Yo

they
had
to

all
four
sides
of
the

Yo

instead
of
Levis
501

,
she
wears
Levi`s
1002`s
.
Yo
mama

,
when
she

,
it

Yo

,
she
was
born
with
a
silver
shovel
in
her

.
Yo

Off
and
on
(
with
Jackie
Gentle
's
help
)
I
have
pulled
together
a
one
page
communication
note
on
our
fundamental
operating
standards
(
itself
a
one
page
summary
)
.
We
are
in
the
final
stages
of
this
process
-
where
we
draft
a
cover
letter
for
John
which
will
introduce
this
for
inclusion
within
Globalflash
(
the
Enron
Europe
newsletter
)
Have
you
any
thoughts
on
draft
or
cover
note
?
Mike
Late
Jan
sounds
great
.
Meagan
does
have
a
couple
of
big
things
on
the
weekend
in
January
--
National
Charity
League
Senior
Presentation
(
big
dance
that
she
and
I
are
committed
to
help
with
)
,
the
Bearkadette
Ball
and
a
winter
party
for
Cotillion
.
I
believe
that
these
are
three
weekends
in
a
row
,
January
6
,
13
and
20th
.
So
the
last
weekend
in
January
would
work
well
(
and
I
will
need
a
rest
from
formal
affairs
!
)
.
Does
that
work
for
you
?
And
do
you
want
to
do
it
on
a
Saturday
or
Sunday
?
Saturday
probably
works
better
for
me
,
just
so
that
I
am
back
in
Houston
and
doing
laundry
by
Sunday
afternoon
!!
Hi
...
Talked
to
the
little
mother
-
to
-
be
.
She
said
a
shower
would
be
grand
.
She
has
some
big
presentation
mid-January
.
How
does
late
January
sound
to
you
.
Should
we
set
a
date
now
?
Am
I
turning
into
Mother
?
Cindy
I
think
that
it
is
a
great
idea
to
get
some
press
regarding
our
fundamental
operating
standards
,
but
I
wonder
about
the
most
appropriate
timing
,
enough
of
a
global
message
and
the
means
of
delivery
.
On
the
means
of
delivery
,
I
am
not
sure
from
your
note
whether
or
not
I
fully
understand
the
intent
.
Is
there
an
article
to
be
included
in
an
Enron
publication
and
in
addition
a
letter
to
be
sent
under
John
's
name
(
if
so
,
to
whom
will
the
letter
be
sent
)
?
Or
is
the
letter
from
John
an
introduction
to
be
included
as
a
lead
in
to
the
article
?
With
regard
to
a
global
message
,
I
think
that
one
of
the
key
points
around
fundamental
operating
standards
are
that
they
are
intended
to
be
global
in
nature
,
applied
to
every
commodity
and
every
location
where
we
engage
in
trading
activities
.
With
these
operating
standards
implemented
worldwide
,
we
will
know
as
operations
professionals
that
risk
is
being
mitigated
and
we
will
be
able
to
ensure
Enron
top
management
that
there
is
consistency
in
operating
standards
worldwide
.
These
global
standards
also
should
enable
Enron
to
expand
its
business
reach
more
quickly
,
with
well
defined
requirements
with
regard
to
trading
operations
.
I
am
not
sure
from
the
article
as
written
that
the
global
nature
of
this
effort
comes
across
.
Finally
,
a
question
regarding
timing
.
The
last
I
knew
after
you
and
Brent
drafted
this
starting
point
for
fundamental
operating
standards
was
that
this
was
being
circulated
(
Shona
took
this
to
do
after
Brent
's
return
to
Houston
)
for
comments
to
all
business
controllers
.
I
do
n't
believe
that
we
are
quite
at
the
point
that
we
can
say
that
all
business
controllers
worldwide
have
reviewed
,
understand
and
have
implemented
these
standards
.
And
not
to
belittle
the
process
of
creating
the
standards
,
the
tough
part
(
and
the
real
meat
behind
this
)
will
be
an
effective
exception
report
on
a
global
basis
against
these
standards
.
My
commitment
to
Rick
Causey
is
that
I
will
have
that
global
report
in
production
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
There
is
much
work
to
do
in
defining
the
content
and
regularity
of
the
report
and
even
more
work
to
do
to
identify
reliable
sources
of
data
for
compiling
the
report
.
Shona
has
commissioned
Mike
Moscoso
to
work
on
this
,
and
I
believe
that
Mike
has
already
been
working
with
James
New
.
So
I
question
whether
or
not
you
want
to
publish
info
about
fundamental
standards
that
we
can
not
yet
report
against
.
Would
a
more
appropriate
time
be
after
the
Global
Operations
Controller
meeting
in
October
when
we
should
have
worldwide
buy
-
in
and
commitment
to
these
standards
and
(
hopefully
)
our
first
draft
of
a
meaningful
exception
report
?
Sorry
that
this
response
looks
so
long
.
I
have
been
interrupted
20
times
while
responding
,
so
I
hope
that
it
makes
sense
.
Thanks
for
sharing
this
with
me
.
Since
you
asked
for
input
,
I
hope
that
you
do
n't
mind
that
I
gave
you
some
.

Steve
:
At
this
point
,
our
IT
contacts
are
backpedalling
a
bit
and
suggesting
they
can
overcome
the
TIBCO
and
Terminal
Server
problems
.
There
are
still
four
important
issues
,
however
:
IT
still
can
not
commit
to
transferring
messages
across
domains
.
This
means
that
messages
initiated
at
Corp
and
intended
for
the
entire
Enron
organization
will
not
reach
any
business
units
outside
the
Corp
domain
.
No
messages
will
reach
the
EES
organization
unless
IBM
agrees
not
to
use
their
proprietary
message
delivery
tool
,
WebSphere
,
and
will
use
WebLogic
instead
.
WebLogic
is
required
by
BackWeb
,
although
it
is
designed
by
a
separate
company
.
HR
,
intended
to
be
a
key
user
of
this
tool
,
will
not
use
BackWeb
because
survey
responses
can
not
be
made
anonymous
.
HR
has
already
purchased
a
tool
called
CONFIRMIT
that
can
execute
anonymous
surveys
.
Messages
will
not
be
delivered
simultaneously
to
all
users
in
the
same
domain
,
nor
will
they
be
delivered
for
two
to
five
hours
after
they
are
sent
by
the
message
administrator
.
Another
thing
to
consider
is
that
these
messages
will
be
set
to
expire
and
disappear
within
a
set
period
of
time
,
meaning
users
can
not
retrieve
them
and
read
them
later
(
as
they
can
with
e-mail
)
.
This
means
that
I
could
be
away
from
the
office
for
several
days
and
miss
a
message
entirely
,
because
it
would
have
expired
and
disappeared
by
the
time
I
returned
.
The
plain
fact
is
that
a
few
members
of
IT
are
pushing
this
initiative
,
but
they
lack
commercial
sponsorship
.
They
are
hoping
Corp
will
foot
the
bill
for
a
pilot
which
will
allow
them
to
fully
test
this
tool
before
implementing
it
company
-
wide
.
Please
let
us
know
if
you
have
additional
questions
.

Do
we
have
a
sense
for
how
many
we
can
reach
,
how
many
we
ca
n't
and
where
they
are
?
Are
whole

(
eg
Tokyo
)
unreachable
or
is
it
only
those
who
have
home

?

A
heartwarming
story
of
the
advances
of
women
in
achieving
equality
throughout
the
world
.
Barbara
Walters
did
a
story
on
gender
roles
in
Kuwait
several
years
before
the
Gulf
War
.
She
noted
then
that
women
customarily
walked
about
10
feet
behind
their
husbands
.
She
returned
to
Kuwait
recently
and
observed
that
the
men
now
walked
several
yards
behind
their
wives
.
Ms.
Walters
approached
one
of
the
women
and
said
,
"
This
is
marvelous
.
Can
you
tell
the
free
world
just
what
enabled
women
here
to
achieve
this
reversal
of
roles
?
"
Land
mines
,
said
the
Kuwaiti
woman
.
Cullen
and
Dykman

all
of
our
changes
on
the
agreement
to
release
the
Tenn

it

.
Maybe
we

That
would

There

Those

should
be
somewhat

to
meet

scheduling

Good
to
hear
from
you
and
I
'm
glad
you
're
available
.
How
is
Wednesday
at
2:30
?
I
did
look
at
EOL
and
am
not
surprised
to
see
its
quality
.
I
was
unable
to
say
much
about
it
in
my
Risk
Electricity
Hedging
and
Trading
report
because
of
deadline
pressures
.
How
is
the
site
doing
?
I
am
intrigued
by
the
competition
for
trading
platforms
and
was
astonished
to
hear
that
Goldman
,
Morgan
,
BP
and
Shell
were
going
to
launch
a
site
to
compete
with
yours
.
Talk
about
a
shotgun
marriage
!
If
we
have
time
next
week
,
I
could
step
you
through
our
website
--
www.weathereffects.com
.
I
'm
very
proud
of
what
we
've
done
.
I
ca
n't
give
out
a
password
yet
but
would
be
happy
to
walk
through
the
site
with
you
over
the
phone
using
my
password
.
It
's
a
very
ambitious
site
--
with
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
WSI
weather
(
seasonal
,
6
-
10
,
and
day
to
day
)
driving
a
good
load
model
for
PJM
and
NEPOOL
.
ESAI
contributes
oil
and
gas
input
price
forecasts
,
capacity
judgments
,
and
"
herding
"
ideas
to
develop
power
price
forecasts
for
same
time
periods
.
After
one
month
's
full
-
bore
effort
,
I
'm
pleased
with
the
results
(
e.g.
,
we
forecast
Nepool
onpeak
to
be
$
43
and
it
turned
out
$
46
)
.
Have
a
great
weekend
.
Ed
Ed
,
I
shall
be
available
on
both
days
.
What
about
Wednesday
,
July
12
,
between
1:30
and
4:00
.
Please
,
let
me
know
what
time
would
work
for
you
.
It
will
be
nice
to
see
you
again

what
do
you
think
?
JoeLardy@cargill.com
on
03/02/2001
10:39:03
AM
Currently
Cargill
and
Enron
have
a
15
MM
collateral
threshold
.
If
possible
,
I
think
the
cleanest
way
to
run
this
biz
would
be
to
put
a
box
around
the
prime
broker
biz
.
We
would
still
operate
under
the
master
isda
but
could
set
up
a
mutually
agreeable
credit
support
annex
for
this
biz
.
We
would
still
keep
the
20,000,000
line
referenced
in
Schedule
B
of
the
POA
agreement
.
The
line
in
the
POA
is
a
seperate
and
distinct
measure
from
the
daily
collateral
.
The
20
mill
reflects
gross
exposure
.
Let
me
know
if
you
think
this
is
reasonable
and
workable
.
We
too
,
are
open
to
suggestion
as
the
Global
and
Enron
relationships
are
very
important
and
a
high
priority
to
us
.
Thanks
Joe
Joe
-
a
few
things
regading
the
POA
/
Cargill
line
..
I
am
going
to
find
out
how
much
line
we
currently
have
available
...
you
probably
already
have
this
.
We
should
allocate
a
piece
to
Global
which
would
solve
the
problem
of
other
Cargill
people
using
the
line
,
putting
us
over
the
limit
,
without
me
knowing
...
We
could
change
the
language
of
the
POA
to
this
...
we
will
not
go
over
Global
's
piece
of
the
Cargill
line
...
I
think
this
would
solve
our
main
concern
...
Please
let
me
know
...
we
are
eager
to
keep
trading
with
Global
and
yourselves
...

,

Please

the

It

I
do
not
think
the
prior
e-mail
got
through
to
Kay
.
Are
either
of
you
familiar
with
this
project
?
We
have
had
no
contact
with
the
ENA
/
Enron
Mexico
commercial
or
legal
people
and
I
do
n't
want
to
bust
any
structuring
goals
.
Our
project
manager
(
Scott
Laidlaw
)
and
engineer
(
Harry
Okabayashi
)
want
to
issue
a
tasking
letter
to
procure
engineering
services
on
this
project
to
support
the
ENA
work
.
I
now
understand
that
someone
at
ENA
/
Enron
Mexico
/
Enron
Wholesale
has
signed
an
EPC
contract
with
ABB
for
this
project
.
I
am
not
in
the
office
today
,
so
please
include
Renee
Alfaro
on
your
response

Hello
Janice
:
I
enjoyed
your
recent
e-mail
but
was
sorry
to
hear
about
your
dad
.
It
sounds
as
though
his
health
has
deteriorated
significantly
.
These
are
always
difficult
times
.
As
I
watched
my
mother
and
father
's
health
deteriorate
and
ultimately
watched
them
die
,
it
is
a
very
defining
time
in
our
lives
.
But
we
can
be
very
thankful
to
have
such
great
parents
and
to
have
had
the
privilege
to
have
been
raised
in
such
loving
homes
.
Sounds
as
though
Eric
has
done
very
well
as
SMSU
.
He
is
joining
an
excellent
company
.
I
am
also
delighted
to
hear
that
he
will
continue
his
education
working
toward
an
MBA
.
As
we
are
living
in
an
age
where
intellectual
capital
is
so
valuable
,
it
is
important
for
every
young
person
to
obtain
the
very
best
possible
education
they
can
.
As
to
our
family
,
within
the
last
ten
days
our
youngest
daughter
Elizabeth
was
married
to
a
young
man
from
Buenos
Aires
,
Argentina
.
They
met
while
they
were
both
working
on
a
project
as
lawyers
in
Buenos
Aires
.
They
're
currently
on
their
honeymoon
but
shortly
after
returning
will
be
moving
from
Buenos
Aires
to
Miami
,
Florida
.
This
past
Thursday
night
our
sixth
grandchild
was
born
.
It
was
born
to
our
son
David
and
his
wife
Courtney
.
It
was
a
7
lb.
,
10
oz.
,
20
inch
little
boy
.
So
we
now
have
three
grandsons
and
three
granddaughters
ranging
from
about
2
years
-
4
months
down
to
a
few
days
.
They
are
a
great
deal
of
fun
.
We
are
doing
quite
well
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
Ginger
"
Rees
"
Copeland
when
she
comes
to
Houston
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
arrange
tickets
for
you
and
your
family
should
you
ever
have
occasion
to
visit
Houston
.
I
hope
you
have
a
great
summer
.
Thank
you
for
your
recent
request
for
Mr.
Lay
to
speak
at
your
conference
.
Unfortunately
,
do
to
Mr.
Lay
's
schedule
he
will
not
be
able
to
participate
.
Thank
you
again
,
Tori
L.
Wells
Executive
Secretary
Hi
-
Just
to
let
you
know
that
it
looks
like
one
day
will
work
.
I
want
to
check
with
Mr.
Lay
before
confirming
.
Thanks
.

Dear
Ken
,
As
you
know
,
our
next
meeting
is
on
Wednesday
,
July
12
from
3:00
-
5:30
p.m
.
In
the
next
week
or
so
,
we
'll
be
sending
around
a
discussion
paper
which
we
hope
crystallizes
the
issues
,
and
we
will
try
to
talk
to
as
many
of
you
as
possible
before
the
meeting
to
go
through
it
.
Meanwhile
,
Arthur
Levitt
has
agreed
to
meet
with
us
in
September
to
brainstorm
on
the
ideas
we
've
generated
and
also
to
give
us
a
sense
of
some
of
the
issues
as
he
sees
them
.
There
are
three
possible
dates
for
the
meeting
,
which
I
suggest
be
in
two
parts
--
first
,
a
meeting
among
the
panel
only
from
5:00
-
6:30
p.m.
,
and
then
a
dinner
with
Chairman
Levitt
from
6:30
-
8:30
p.m
.
Here
are
the
dates
:
Could
you
please
let
us
know
which
of
these
would
be
possible
for
you
:
Thursday
,
September

5:00

.
Ken
said
to
go
ahead
and
equip
it
with
what
you
think
it
should
have
.
Please
let
me
know
when
he
can

I
will
follow
up
with
the

The
M300
series
are
the
lightest
and
the
E500's
are
the
all
in
one
but
much
heavier

Hi
Mr.

I
believe
someone
called
about
this
today
,
but
Mr.

these

do
n't
work
for
him
,
either
.
Sorry
.
Rosalee
let

Makes

I

will

as
well
.
Now
,
Debbie
wants
it
.
I
gave
$
16,900
+
tax
.
It
is
very
clean
and
is
Sandalwood

Driftwood
or
something
of

.
Almost
silver
.
I
have
to
pick
up

over
at
Jerry

.
Debbie
said
,
it
is
going
to
be
hard
on
me
to
sale
my
old
dodge
truck
.
I
said
Yep
,
had
that
truck
longer
than
I
have
had
most
of
my
women
.
I
really
need
to
engage
brain
before
articulating
!
I
am
doing
dirt
work
and
hope
to
plant
ST

by
Friday
before
rain

One
thing
is
for
sure
,
the
economy
is
not
faltering
on
my
account
.
Dow
Stock
is
back
up
over
$
33
.
Hooray
,
hoorah
!
Needs
to
go
to
$
41
and
then
I
will
be
happy
.
I
spoke
with
Gerald
and
he
said
there
are
a
bunch
of
folks
hanging
around
Dad
's
place
.
We
need
to
change
the
lock
and
place
posted
signs
at
the
gate
.
I
may
want
to
put
some
steers
or
heifers
up
there
.
I
am
going
up
soon
and
having
the
tractor
fixed
.
Reggie
said
he
will
pay
us
soon
.
He
also
still
wants
the
tractor
if
we
can
hold
on
to
it
.
First
come
,
first
serve
.
When
is
the
wedding
?
We
're
set
for
11/01/01
.
Be
sure
to
take
your
sweety
out
on
the
balcony
tonight
and
gaze
at
the
full
moon
.
It
was
sure
beautiful
coming
up
last
night
.
We
used
to
go
out
and
lay
in
the
pasture
on
a
blanket
and
watch
for
the
space
shuttle
.
I
had
a
couple
of
hickies
on
my
neck
the
day
after
and
the
guys
all
wanted
to
know
if
those
were
shuttle
burns
.
Just
jealous
.
My
kid
is
making
wonderful
grades
and
has
reassured
me
she
will
graduate
within
the
four
year
period
.
She
still
has
some
sort
of
scholarship
but
I
am
not
for
sure
how
much
it
pays
.
She
is
going
to
be
a
kinesiologist
,
sports
injury
therapist
.
I
think
she
just
wants
to
be
able
to
touch
football
players
legs
.
She
will
be
20
on
11/03
.
I
am
really
proud
of
her
.
Cindy
said
Jaime
has
grown
up
very
much
.
You
should
e
mail
her
sometimes
.
I
am
sure
she
would
like
to
hear
from
you
.
Jgerma5@aol.com
.
At
any
rate
,
be
careful
and
be
safe
.
You
should
have
listened
to
Maw
,
as
long
as
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
pants
zipped
,
you
will
be
alright
.
Shucks
,
guess
none
of
us
three
paid
much
attention
to
that
.
Oh
,
Jeff
Sherrar
has
a
new
book
out
.
Rise

.
There
were
some
pretty
cool
dudes
back
around
1774
/
76
.
There
will
be
two
volumes
to
this
saga
.
I
am
half
way
through
the
first
and
you
can
borrow
it
when
I
am
through
.
I
sure
like
his
style
of
writing
.
His
books
are
always
hard
to
put
down
.

What
's
happening
?
I
understand
you
have
a
brand
new
truck
.
Must
be
nice
having
money
!!
I
need
2
things
from
you
.
1
.
I
found
the
title
to
the
4
wheeler
and
I
was
going
to
change
it
over
to
you
name
.
What
do
you
think
?
If
that
's
ok
,
how
do
you
want
your
name
to
show
up
on
the
title
and
what
address
should
I
use
?
2
.
I
'm
getting
ready
to
divy
up
the
Dow
stock
.
How
many
of
Dad
's
shares
do
you
have
?
Last
thing
,
send
me
a
million
dollars
,
I
'm
tired
of
working
.
I
thought
we
only
had
cashout
,
at
most
3
times
,
before
this
June
.
I
ca
n't
remember
.
I
do
know
that
most
of
the
time
this
plant
was
not
buring
like
it
did
in
July
and
August
of
this
year
.
I
say
we
just
keep
the
dough
and
go
to
Mexico
.
Hey
guys
,
Would
you
please
ck
the
Oglethorpe
deal
from
July
2000
-
Dec
2000
?
Is
there
supposed
to
be
a
cashout
booked
in
Sitara
for
these
months
?
Oglethorpe
over
paid
their
invoice
every
month
.
I
believe
that
Doug
told
me
the
extra
was
for
the
cashout
that
was
not
invoiced
.
Thanks
Darla
I
ca
n't
get
through
on
the
phones
.
Please

Hello
-
I
spoke
with
Jeff
Hodge
yesterday
regarding
the
additional
language
from
Peoples
regarding
Audit
Rights
.
His
initial
reaction
was
that
their
request
was
probably
reasonable
and
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
a
jointly
owned
L.L.C
.
However
,
he
did
suggest
a
couple
slight
revisions
to
protect
Enron
's
interests
.
1
)
Highlighting
that
information
will
only
be
provided
that
is
related
to
enovate
and
2
)
that
each
designated
representative
should
sign
an
appropriate
confidentiality
agreement
.
This
language
has
been
included
in
the
attached
draft
.
My
goal
,
however
optimistic
,
is
to
execute
the
risk
policy
by
the
end
of
today
.
Activity
is
picking
up
dramatically
and
the
fine
line
is
getting
further
blurred
each
passing
day
.
Therefore
,
I
need
to
know
ASAP
if
there
are
any
problems
with
the
draft
as
written
.
Otherwise
,
I
will
be
sending
it
to
Peoples
as
our
final
revision
by
mid
morning
.
Thanks
for
your
prompt
attention
to
this
.

It
is
less
complicated
for
me
to
initial
and
fax
than
to
track
down
someone
who
does
n't
know
anything
about
it
and
get
them
to
initial
it
.
I
can
print
it
here
,
initial
it
,
and
fax
it
to
whomever
you
want
.
Plus
,
I
work
with
Janet
a
lot
so
she
may
get
some
comfort
from
that
,
instead
of
having
a
lawyer
she
has
n't
dealt
with
initial
it
.
She
is
very
conscientious
about
what
she
signs
,
and
who
initials
what
.
Is
the
attached
form
the
final
final
form
?
Where
and
to
whom
do
you
want
it
faxed
?
Thanks
,
Kay
Since
it
will
be
Janet
signing
,
it
will
probably
be
better
to
have
the
initials
on
the
pages
first
.
Either
fax
or
someone
else
works
fine
.
Let
me
know
which
is
easier
and
we
can
coordinate
.

I
'm
working
on
it
now
.
Maybe
we
(
Enron
)
could
review
it
tomorrow
morning
,
then
send
it
to
FCE
.
I
can
meet
around
10:00
.
That
way
,
we
can
get
it
to
them
in
time
for
weekend
review
.
Does
that
work
?
Kay
It
was
good
to
hear
from
you
!
We
had
a
nice
Thanksgiving
here
too
.
It
's
funny
,
because
usually
it
's
just
me
,
Mom
,
Craig
and
Danelia
,
and
Danelia
does
n't
really
like
roasted
turkey
or
roast
beef
(
not
that
she
would
say
it
to
me
!
)
,
so
there
is
not
just
the
same
joy
in
cooking
it
would
be
elsewise
.
It
was
good
having
the
girls
down
.
We
played
a
new
version
of
Uno
called
"
African
Uno
"
that
was
complex
,
fast
and
at
times
,
physically
challenging
.
It
's
not
for
the
meek
.
It
was
incredible
what
a
good
player
Alena
was
.
She
had
her
cards
memorized
as
well
as
everyone
else
s
(
when
you
play
you
'll
see
why
you
can
know
everyone
else
s
hands
!
)
.
I
expect
Craig
did
n't
want
Mom
to
see
his
place
because
it
was
messy
.
I
think
compared
to
my
house
,
he
's
embarrased
about
his
apartment
.
Then
,
also
,
he
's
got
so
much
stuff
in
there
right
now
,
that
I
do
n't
know
how
he
's
going
to
fit
baby
stuff
.
They
would
only
give
him
a
6
month
lease
when
he
renewed
his
lease
last
month
because
they
do
n't
want
3
people
in
that
small
apartment
.
So
he
's
going
to
have
to
start
looking
for
another
place
.
And
his
apartment
is
so
run
down
down
I
'm
afraid
roaches
might
be
crawling
over
the
baby
.
I
guess
Mom
is
going
to
come
back
down
sometime
in
March
or
April
to
see
the
new
baby
.
You
'll
have
to
come
visit
to
check
out
my
new
house
.
The
upstairs
"
guest
suite
"
is
pretty
neat
.
It
's
got
its
own
bathroom
and
tv
,
and
is
pretty
cozy
.
As
far
as
the
call
with
Uncle
Ben
goes
,
if
he
was
thrilled
to
hear
from
me
I
could
n't
tell
by
his
voice
.
It
was
a
pretty
stilted
conversation
for
both
of
us
.
But
,
I
guess
,
it
's
a
start
...
I
've
already
made
my
XMAS
plans
.
I
leave
the
evening
of
the
21st
,
my
flight
comes
in
about
10
pm
,
and
leave
the
morning
of
the
27th
at
6
am
.
It
's
good
chatting
with
you
.
Keep
in
touch
!

thing
(
although
I
had
already

Chris
and
Ben
did
a
marvelous

for

,
I
can
testify
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
Thanksgiv8ing
Dinners
I
've
ever
had
(
I
not
gon
na
tell
them
that
,
I
do
n't
want
them
getting
swell
heads
)
.
Ma
said
she
had
a
great
time
in
Houston
,
She
was
happy
to
see
yourself
,
as
well
as
C
&
D
.
I
think
she
likes
her
special
room
in
your
house
.
You
r
gon
na
be
the
first
to
see
the
new
baby
(
woud
n't
it
be
wierd
if
the
baby
gets
botn
on
Jan
5th
?
)
Why
did
n't
Craig
show
Ma
his
appartment
?
What
do
you
think
about
your
phone
ocnversation
with
Unlce
Ben
(
he
was
almost
shocked
)
?
Are
you
coming
for
Xmas
?
Got
ta
go
for
now

Attached
is
the
referenced
agreement
.
Let
me
know
if
the
notice
information
is
OK
with
you
.
If
so
,
I
'll
get
it
signed
by
Craig
Breslau
today
,
then
bring
it
to
you
for
countersignature
.
Thinking
about
that
,
what
's
your
title
?
I
'm
not
sure
you
have
the
authority
to
sign
documents
w/o
special
authority
...
No
,
it
does
not
mean
that
.
Adding
all
the
Enron
"
Specified
Entities
"
would
only
make
a
default
under
a
financial
transaction
with
those
other
Enron
entities
a
default
under
this
agreement
.
Our
concern
is
that
we
do
n't
want
any
trading
related
defaults
to
ever
trigger
a
default
under
a
loan
transaction
which
has
a
swap
as
a
component
.

If
you
do
add
all
the
entities
,
does
that
mean
that
we
would
not
need
to
put
in
place
a
separate
agreement
for
ECCL
?
With
respect
to
Deutsche
Bank
(
""
DB
"
)
,
we
have
one
credit
issue
remaining
,
DB
would
like
us
to
add
all
the
Enron
trading
entities
DB
trades
with
as
Specified
Entities
under
the
ISDA
Master
Agreement
and
we
are
somewhat
hesitant
to
do
so
,
as
this
could
potentially
roll
up
swaps
under
structured
loan
transactions
into
a
default
under
the
ISDA
Agreement
.
Sara
and
Bill
Bradford
in
Credit
are
supposed
to
talk
to
the
DB
Credit
people
about
this
remaining
issue
.
With
respect
to
First
Union
National
Bank
,
the
draft
we
were
working
from
was
so
old
that
they
agreed
to
look
at
our
current
form
of
agreement
which
was
sent
to
them
on
11/8/00
for
review
.
Sara
is
working

that
with

'
,
can
you
please
let
me
know
what
counterparty
this
is
so
we
can
correctly
assess
the
counterparty
exposure
.
Thank
you
,
Russell
Hey
there
yourself
,
Sorry
I
have
n't
written
you
guys
in
a
while
to
keep
you
properly
updated
.
I
am
indeed
checking
on
flights
to
Seoul
and
do
n't
think
I
'm
going
to
go
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
my
parents
.
As
much
fun
as
they
are
,
I
figured
we
would
probably
do
some
different
things
than
what
you
have
planned
for
them
.
As
for
Ted
,
things
are
still
going
well
although
I
have
n't
see
him
at
all
this
week
(
we
are
two
very
busy
people
)
.
But
,
we
had
a
great
laid
back
day
last
Saturday
and
I
think
have
hit
that
comfortable
stage
...
you
know
,
not
quite
so
formal
about
dates
etc
.
In
one
sense
it
's
great
,
but
it
also
makes
things
a
lot
harder
to
read
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
sure
my
Mom
told
you
guys
but
Travis
and
Kathy
got
to
meet
him
and
I
think
it
went
well
.
Hopefully
,
if
we
're
still
dating
come
December
,
you
and
Chuck
can
meet
him
when
you
come
back
to
visit
.
I
'm
planning
on
dragging
him
to
at
least
one
of
the
U.T.
games
,
I
just
have
to
find
out
when
he
wants
to
go
(
as
well
as
properly
prepare
him
for
the
Scott
/
Kelley
/
Parks
/
Wild
Card
gang
and
the
full
-
day
affair
that
is
a
U.T.
game
)
.
Things
in
Houston
are
good
and
definitely
warm
.
I
went
with
Emily
and
her
Mom
last
night
to
see
the
musical
"
Rent
"
and
it
was
wonderful
.
Also
,
I
'm
going
out
to
San
Diego
for
the
Labor
Day
weekend
to
visit
Hoot
's
daughter
Julie
.
Needless
to
say
I
am
very
excited
.
Talk
to
you
guys
soon
,
Susan
Hey
girlie
,
How
are
you
doing
?
Have
n't
heard
from
you
in
a
while
.
A
little
birdie
told
me
that
you
were
checking
into
tickets
for
Seoul
.
Are
you
really
?
Would
you
come
with
your
parents
or
separately
?
In
any
case
,
we
have
had
some
more
time
to
do
some
exploring
(
and
shopping
)
,
so
we
have
some
good
ideas
about
what
to
do
if
you
come
.
I
think
that
we
will
stay
in
Korea
when
your
parents
come
and
do
the
whole
base
thing
(
which
will
take
only
a
few
minutes
,
actually
)
,
but
are
considering
going
to
China
or
somewhere
during
part
of
Thanksgiving
.
We
'll
do
whatever
you
want
want
if
you
still
are
coming
!
Let
us
know
the
latest
with
Ted
and
also
with
what
's
going
on
in
Houston
.
Take
care

Hey
Tonto
(
a.k.a
-
the
trusty
,
but
silent
,
side
-
kick
to
the
Lone
Ranger
or
in
this
case
the
Big
D
)
The
play
was
very
good
and
I
think
well
received
.
I
'd
forgotten
how
blown
away
I
was
by
some
of
the
songs
the
first
time
I
saw
it
in
NY
.
The
cast
members
really
have
to
have
incredibly
powerful
voices
to
pull
off
a
few
of
the
most
poignant
numbers
(
I
think
this
could
be
your
true
calling
)
.
I
caught
the
third
day
of
Corey
's
Jeopardy
run
last
night
here
at
the
office
(
yes
,
I
had
to
come
back
after
the
play
...
I
love
my
job
!
)
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
sure
I
'd
mentioned
it
before
but
yes
she
is
a
very
smart
girl
.
As
a
result
of
that
,
she
has
managed
on
several
occasions
over
the
years
to
detract
from
my
enjoyment
of
playing
Trivial
Pursuit
or
watching
Jeopardy
by
absolutely
obliterating
me
(
The
girl
actually
did
her
senior
thesis
on
Trivia
)
.
Kori
told
me
she
saw
you
last
night
at
Steak
Night
and
introduced
herself
since
I
failed
to
do
so
the
last
time
we
went
.
I
should
let
you
know
though
that
she
was
very
offended
this
morning
that
you
did
n't
spell
her
name
right
in
the
email
-
I
mean
it
's
such
a
common
spelling
.
So
was
Darren
there
last
night
to
meet
her
or
do
you
just
think
they
'd
make
a
good
match
?
She
's
a
very
fun
girl
.
Hope
you
day
is
going
well
and
that
the
move
to
30
went
off
without
a
hitch
.
Good
luck
with
all
of
the
"
fun
"
meetings
.
Shorty
--
Due
to
the
lack
of
response
yesterday
,
I
'm
beginning
to
worry
about
your
success
with
the
road
test
...
I
'm
going
to
assume
that
you
did
n't
get
around
to
it
.

How
was
the
play
?
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
I
saw
your
friend
on
a
re-run
Jeopardy
the
other
night
and
I
almost
called
you
but
it
came
on
at
11:30
.
Smart
girl
.
I
ran
into
Corey
last
night
at
LW
s
and
I
am
thinking
this
is
a
girl
for
Darren
.
Anyway
,
lots
of
fun
meetings
today
.
I
'll
talk
to
you
later
.
Maybe
you
should
ignore
the
sentiment
of
the
quote
I
sent
earlier
...
I
think
you
may
be
adhering
to
it
too
faithfully
.
At
this
rate
we
may
have
to
start
pinning
notes
to
your
shirt
to
remind
you
to
do
things
.
However
,
having
driven
with
you
on
several
occasions
I
feel
confident
you
will
be
able
to
pass
the
test
with
flying
colors
.
Keep
in
mind
though
that
if
you
end
up
failing
I
will
not
let
you
forget
it
(
and
,
as
we
have
established
,
I
have
the
memory
of
an
elephant
)
.
I
'll
keep
discussion
of
me
to
a
minimum
and
just
say
that
things
are
well
on
32
.
Now
back
to
what
's
really
important
...
you
.
Thought
you
'd
like
to
know
that
the
Dixie
Chicks
are
coming
back
to
Houston
Dec.
12
and
will
performing
just
down
the
street
from
you
at
the
Compaq
Center
...
it
's
all
about
you
and
your
needs
.

AAAAAGGGHHHHHH
...
I
just
found
out
that
I
need
to
take
the
TX
driver
s
exam
both
written
and
on
the
rode
.
This
is
a
two
day
process
and
all
because
I
let
my
CA
license
expire
.
I
know
I
need
some
of
your
organizational
skills
.
I
may
try
to
run
out
and
take
the
test
this
afternoon
while
I
get
moved
to
30
(
I
better
not
fail
it
)
.
How
's
life
on
32
today
--
well
that
's
enough
about
you
let
's
talk
more
about
me
.
There
is
no
pleasure
in
having
nothing
to
do
;
the
fun
is
in
having
lots
to
do
and
not
doing
it
.

it

Thanks

Sharon
I
think
they
'll
send
us
another
update
once
he
's
out
of
emergency
and
into
a

Then
it
's
real
easy
to
call
Ben

to
find
out
a

number
.?
The

is
below
.?
It
does
n't
sound
like
he
can
receive

yet
.
A
.
Thanks
for
the

up

Do
you
know
the
address
to
send

??
Do
you
know

Some
of

I
think
it
's
a
good
idea
since
the
provisional
application
is
on
file
-
Travis
is
the
internal
lawyer
who
has
taken
care
of
the
patent
application
so
he
will
have
better
ideas
for
where
the
words
should
be
placed
and
appropriate
look
and
feel
(
I
would
guess
near
the
copyright
notice
and
roughly
equivalent
size
)

,
We
are
thinking
of
adding

key

pages
(
like
the

.
Can
you
offer
comments

?
Dave
Does
it
make
sense
for
us
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
you
participating
from
Buenos
Aires
?
I
'm
not
sure
we
have
much
to
tell
them
at
this
stage
-
actually
,
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
have
anything
new
to
report

if
you
do
that
would
be
fine

We

We
will
meet
Dave

his

We
would
like
to
fit
a
meeting
with
you
as
a

individually

Please
let

know
about
your

one
of
you
in
one

Further
background
:
Argentina
intend
to
press
ahead
even
given
the
concern
about
taxes
,
etc
.
They
wish
to
launch
on
Sept.
1
-
meaning
we
will
need
to
be
sending
mailings
sometime
around
mid-August
.

If
you
need
more
,
there
is
a
proposal
from
the
documentation
committee
for
a
new
alternative
for
calculating
termination
amounts
(
we
heard
about
it
in
Amsterdam
)
that
I
think
will
be
particularly
attractive
to
the
energy
markets
.
I
do
n't
know
where
this
stands
officially
(
I
have
n't
heard
any
developments
since
Amsterdam
)
but
I
can
find
out
from
Bob
Pickle
if
you
want
.

ISDA
energy
definitions

CFTC
matters
re
energy
and
an
overview
of
power
deregulation
developments
in
North
America
.
I
might
also
add
a
few
items
about
international
developments
and
the
EEI
physical
power

form

I
am
thinking
4

there

belongs

the

(
based
in

)
.
Unfortunately
,
I
ca
n't
forward
your
message
to
him
directly
(
there
seems
to
be
a
problem
with
the
attachment
)
.
If
you
still
have
it
,
can
you
send
it
to
him
at
"

"
?
I
will
take
care
of
it
.
Thanks

I
left
you
a
voice
mail
on
Friday

I
looked
at
the
UEComm
Master
and
had
some
comments
--
such
as
our
name
is
wrong
,
the
cross
default
threshold
for
us
should
be
US
$
and
not
AUD
,
and
there
were
a
few
other
questions
I
had
.

CONGRATULATIONS
!!!!!!!
We
've
been
asking
everyday
if
anyone
had
heard
if
the
"
Babies
Elliott
"
had
arrived
.
Glad
to
hear
that
they
are
all
healthy
and
were
a
good
size
,
and
that
Mom
is
doing
well
.
Look
forward
to
seeing
pictures
of
the
little
ones
.
I
know
you
all
are
going
to
have
so
much
fun
with
them
.
Hope
you
've
been
storing
up
sleep
,
cause
it
looks
like
you
wo
n't
be
getting
much
for
a
while
.
Again
,
congratulations
.
These
three
little
ones
do
n't
realize
how
lucky
they
are
to
have
such
a
nice
Dad
,
but
I
'm
sure
they
'll
find
out
soon
.
Take
care
Marie
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
This
is
just
to
let
you
know
that
Emma
gave
birth
at
week
34
on
Friday
,
6th
July
,
to
our
triplets
:
Benjamin
James
-
at
12.45
pm
-
3
lbs
4
ozs
Toby
William
-
12.46
pm
-
4
lbs
Hannah
May
-
12.48
pm
-
3
lbs
15
ozs
.
Although
small
,
they
are
all
"
fully
functioning
"
and
very
well
-
they
are
in
the
lowest
level
of
special
care
(
and
they
will
probably
be
in
there
for
another
two
to
four
weeks
)
until
they
can
feed
properly
and
maintain
their
weights
.
Emma
is
fine
,
too
-
very
well
!!
All
the
best
and
kind
regards
Mark

:
I
am
attaching
a
clean
and
blacklined
version
of
the
proposed
resolutions
authorizing
the
opening
of
brokerage
accounts
.
I
have
attempted
to
revise
them
to
make
them
clearer
.
Perhaps
Jim
Armogida
can
assist
in
revising
them
as
I
am
sure
he
is
more
familiar
with
the
way
Enron
Corp.
likes
their
resolutions
drafted
than
we
are
.
Let

if
you

place

the
sum
of
$
8

one
by
Niagara

am
told
that
our
respective
credit
departments
want
to
raise
the
credit
lines
to
$
10
M
for
each
party
,
but
to
effect
that
we
will
have
to
modify
the
existing
Guaranties
accordingly
.
Let
me
know

this
is
your
understanding
,
as
well

After
you

had
the
chance

review
the

a
marked

Hi
everyone
,
I
just
got
of
the
phone
with
Hai
and
he
told
me
how
to
make
an
adjustment
on
a
day
to
day
basis
in
regards
to
incorrect
liquidations
but
he
also
explained
this
is
just
to
make
the
daily
P&L
#'s
right
,
if
nothing
were
done
the
month
end
P&L
would
still
somehow
work
out
because
adjustments
would
be
made
.
Does
this
mean
that
for
June
and
for
a
certain
portion
of
July
we
should
not
do
anything
and
just
make
adjustments
on
a
going
forward
basis
(
and
assume
everything
will
work
out
at
month
end
)
?
If
this
is
the
case
I
would
like
someone
to
walk
me
through
June
to
see
if
the
numbers
did
really
work
themselves
out
as
there
was
a
large
swing
in
second
order
on
June
29
that
was
not
adjusted
for
.
Let
me
know
if
one
of
you
could
help
me
do
this
.
Karim

Evidently
,
this
a
problem
that
Stacey
White
has
been
aware
of
for
a
couple
of
months
now
.
There
was
a
change
made
in
the
coding
for
the
delta
position
and
this
has
somehow
messed
up
the
liq
value
.
John
John

I

problems

there

a
sign

flipping
problem
for

that
's
causing
this
whole

I
'll
keep
you

thirty
signatories
to
the
Comprehensive
Settlement
,
the
Comprehensive
Settlement
document
itself
,
and
the
various
appendices
to
the
settlement
.?
Because
a
number
of
the

are
not
yet
available
electronically
,
they
have
not
been
included
with
this

Hard

including
all
declarations
and
signature
pages
,
are
being
shipped
tonight
via
US
mail
to
all
parties
on
the
service
list
.?
Additional
printed
copies
should
be
available
within
the
next
day
or
so
and
I
will
make
them
available
to
all
of
you
-
just
let
me
know
how
many
copies
you
need
.
I
would
like
to
thank
all
of
the
parties
who
participated
in
this
settlement
process
.?
You
have
all
devoted
considerable
time
,
resources
and
spirit
in
the
preparation
of
this
document
-
and
it
shows
.?
We
now
have
a
settlement
before
the
Commission

includes
ratepayer
advocates
,
commercial
and
industrial
customers
,
electric
generators
,
marketers
,
shippers

,
utilities
,
aggregators
,
pipeline
companies
,
wholesale
customers
,
municipalities
,
and
retail
mass
marketers
,
among
others
.?
While
we
should
be
proud
of
our
accomplishment
,
we
now
must
turn
to
the
task
of
getting
our
testimony
ready
by
May
5
deadline
.?
Assignments
have
already
been
made
and
I
will
schedule
a
conference
call
later
this
week
to
discuss
related
details
.?
So
much
for
resting
on
our
laurels
.?
Once

Attached
is
a
rough
draft
of
my
talking
points
for
a
panel
I
'll
be
on
at
a
CEM
conference
in
SF
on
Thursday
afternoon
.
Have
distributed
to
Western
GA
team
(
plus
Steffes
)
for
comment
and
thought
you
may
have
some
,
too
.
Topic
for
panel
,
"
PUC
Priorities
.
"
Goal
is
to
(
politely
?
)
refute
Loretta
Lynch
's
and
Carl
Woods
'
continued
assertions
that
1
)
California
's
move
to
deregulate
was
based
solely
on
ideology
with
no
basis
in
fact
and
2
)
the
solution
is
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
command
-
and
-
control
regulation
.
The
FERC
order
tomorrow
is
likely
to
alter
the
points
somewhat
.
Comments
are
much
appreciated
.
Best
,
Jeff
Chris
:
As
we
discussed
yesterday
,
Laird
and
I
spoke
and
we
think
that
the
presentation
is
good
to
go
for
Thursday
.
We
'll
need
to
update
the
numbers
for
the
offer
we
made
to
S.D.
last
week
.
You
had
mentioned
that
you
might
want
to
include
a
shaped
product
.
You
still
considering
it
?
Let
us
know
and
we
can
add
it
,
and
make
any
other
changes
you
'd
like
to
make
at
this
end
.
My
flight
gets
into
S.D.
at
at
8:35
on
southwest
.
Best
,
Jeff
Sandi
sez
it
's
actually
happening
at
10
AM
and
it
's
renewable
-
focused
.

Dear
Justin
Marly
asked
me
to
respond
to
you
.
As
you
know
,
the
suffix
ONLINE
is
purely
descriptive
and
now
used
by
many
companies
.
Therefore
,
any
trade
mark
registration
that
incorporates
the
word
ONLINE
as
a
suffix
in
the
way
that
you
use
it
will
not
enable
its
owner
to
prevent
others
from
using
the
word
ONLINE
.
Given
the
above
,
if
you
have
adequate
protection
for
the
word
ENRON
(
which
covers
the
services
that
you
offer
on
-
line
as
well
as
your
core
activities
)
,
I
'd
say
that
another
application
for
the
words
ENRON
ONLINE
is
probably
unnecessary
.
However
,
if
you
use
a
particular
logo
for
the
on
-
line
service
,
that
should
be
registered
.
I
hope
the
above
is
clear
.
Jonathan
Day
Marly

If
you
could
respond
to
me
on
this
request
,
thanks

Can
one
of
you
give
me
a
quick
call
to
discuss
.
I
'm
@
X37047
.
Thanks
.
I
believe
we
are
to
some
extent
already
protected
with
"
Enron
"
proceeded
with
anything
,
but
EnronOnline
(
TM
)
,
etc.
just
affords
us
more
protection
.
I
assume
this
is
akin
to
why
McDonald
's
trademarks
"
Mc
"
Everything
?
David

Paul
,
Can
you
please
give
me
a
call
to
discuss
trademarking
?
i.e.
Are
we
covered
if
we
proceed
a
word
with
"
Enron
"
?
e.g.
:
EnronEAuction
.
If
we
are
covered
,
then
was
it
necessary
to
register
EnronOnline
?
Thanks
,
Dave

Per
my
conversation
with
Edmund
this
morning
,
we
are
moving
the
following
countries
to
the
non-approved
list
:
Austria
,
Belgium
,
Croatia
,
Czech
Republic
,
Denmark
,
Poland
,
Portugal
,
Romania
,
Singapore
,
and
Slovenia
.
Below
is
the
list
,
now
updated
to
reflect
this
change
.
Jurisdictions
which
are
are
approved
to
trade
credit
derivatives
:
Finland
,
Germany
,
Norway
,
Sweden
,
Switzerland
,
the
U.K
,
and
the
U.S.
.
Jurisdictions
which
are
not
approved
to
trade
credit
derivatives
include
:
Austria
,
Belgium
,
Canada
,
Croatia
,
Czech
Republic
,
Denmark
,
France
,
Gibraltar
,
Ireland
,
Italy
,
Poland
,
Portugal
,
Romania
,
Scotland
,
Singapore
,
Slovenia
,
Spain
,
and
The
Netherlands
.
For
banks
incorporated
in
a
non-approved
jurisdiction
,
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
trade
out
of
a
branch
located
in
an
approved
jurisdiction
(
i.e.
U.S.
and
U.K.
branches
)
.
This
would
have
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
.
Please
let
me
know
if
there
are
any
changes
to
this
list
.

With
regard
to
our
annual
review
of
this
list
of
laws
we
need

do
we

provinces
new
"

You

Why
does
it
always
have
to
be
my
deals
...?!!!
We
've
received
a
personal
invitation
to
a
NYMEX
Crawfish
Boil
on
April
3
at
5:00
at
Garden
in
the
Heights
at
3926
Feagan
.
The
cause
of
this
celebration
is
the
10th
anniversary
of
the
Nat
Gas
futures
contract
.
It
would
be
nice
if
Shankman
and
John
Arnold
could
attend
.
Perhaps
you
can
give
them
a
personal
invitation
...
We
have
received
the
amendment
to
the
BC
Gas
ISDA
Master
executed
by
BC
Gas
,
which
adds
the
Canadian
Securities
Representation
,
so
we
do
n't
have
to
add
the
rep
into
every
confirm
.
BC
Gas
wo
n't
sign
the
confirms
with
the
rep
in
,
and
this
has
caused
much
difficulties
.
I
am
going
to
count
it
as
signed
,
since
BC
Gas
has
signed
,
but
we
still
need
it
to
be
signed
by
ECC
.
Can
you
get
it
signed
ASAP
and
back
to
me
.
Much
thanks
.
We
have
received
the
executed
Amendment
to
the
Subscription
Agreement
with
WeatherTrade
,
Inc.
dated
March
2
,
2000
.
This
Amendment
amends
the
Transaction
Fee
referenced
in
subparagraph
(
c
)
of
the
Fee
Schedule
to
the
Subscription
Agreement
.
Copies
will
be
distributed
.
Updating
another
blue
file
because
Susan
B.
,
this
time
,
has
not
updated
it
to
reference
mergers
&
name
changes
!
It
appears
you
missed
some
cpys
on
the
referenced
list
because
Tom
had
the
freeze
panel
button
on
,
and
you
probably
did
n't
see
them
at
first
.
I
did
n't
either
until
I
clicked
on
the
down
button
and
they
popped
up
.
When
you
have
a
minute
,
I
'll
give
me
a
call
and
I
'll
come
around
and
show
you
how
to
unfreeze
the
panel
.
I
spoke
to
Edmund
to
get
the
scoop
on
what
we
are
going
to
be
doing
on
the
confirms
for
Credit
Derivatives
,
and
he
said
that
his
current
understanding
is
that
all
of
the
confirms
will
be
done
out
of
London
.
I
communicated
that
to
Bob
Bowen
.
He
also
said
that
London
was
going
to
be
hiring
120
people
to
deal
with
the
Credit
Derivatives
business
.
Wow
!
Carol
,
will
you
handle
this

The
intention
of
the
efforts
and
actions
documented
in
my
earlier
update
(
see
attached
email
)
was
to
provide
a
robust
position
signoff
process
for
total
metal
tonnage
,
spread
and
brand
and
location
a
timely
substantiation
of
stock
on
balance
sheet
forward
MTM
debtors
and
creditor
balances
OBSF
transactional
values
and
a
reconciliation
of
the
barclays
intercompany
account
Despite
the
best
efforts
of
IT
,
continuing
problems
with
the
AS400
application
,
a
better
understanding
of
the
inconsistency
between
stock
reconciliation
reports
,
and
concerns
over
the
useability
of
the
outright
stock
screen
enquiry
are
such
that
I
am
currently
not
confident
of
delivering
sufficient
accurate
information
to
AA
to
satisfy
their
audit
requirements
-
which
at
a
macro
level
is
the
transparent
audit
trail
between
stock
and
forward
positions
to
full
accounting
values
.
Consequently
I
need
to
inform
you
of
,
and
/
or
require
your
approval
for
,
the
following
:
I
will
discuss
with
AA
the
following
that
OBSF
values
within
the
extended
trial
balance
may
be
misstated
due
to
data
issues
(
above
and
beyond
existing
conversations
with
AA
on
model
simplifications
)
that
there
are
reconciling
differences
between
trader
position
analyses
,
AS400
on
screen
enquiries
and
the
formal
global
position
report
(
these
differences
are
at
present
not
understood
but
would
need
to
be
provided
to
AA
within
the
audit
timetable
)
an
outline
of
the
internal
balance
sheet
review
process
described
in
my
earlier
note
which
must
now
be
reprioritised
and
rescoped
(
see
MO
work
)
The
creation
of
an
incentive
payment
pool
(
possibly
via
personal
best
awards
)
for
key
Metals
staff
who
continue
to
work
exceptionally
unsociable
hours
to
meet
the
above
stated
objectives
The
signoff
for
additional
permanent
'
Enron
'
headcount
who
will
'
duplicate
'
certain
key
position
control
processes
ultimately
replacing
some
existing
Traffic
staff
A
reconciling
difference
of
$
15
mm
exists
between
the
reported
DPR
and
the
final
accounting
p&l
as
generated
on
the
AS400
.
We
will
continue
to
investigate
potential
misstatements
in
the
system
p&l
,
as
a
result
of
data
or
system
valuation
problems
,
within
the
month
end
reporting
timeframe
.
However
,
this
difference
may
need
to
be
adjusted
for
following
a
final
review
and
signoff
of
system
p&l
values
with
traders
.
The
recall
of
all
OBSF
stock
in
early
April
and
retention
on
balance
sheet
(
reduced
where
economically
viable
)
until
positions
are
fully
reconciled
and
repeatable
daily
signoff
process
can
be
instigated
.
Middle
Office
work
being
prioritised
is
as
follows
the
stock
circularisation
initiated
for
close
of
business
23rd
-
with
full
reconciliation
of

to
current

by

the
stock
and
forward

report
for
the

to

issues
)
,
requiring

for

Several
related
issues
have
resulted
in
an
increase
in
the
level
of
operating
risk
for
the
Merchanting
Metals
business
.
Complexities
surrounding
the
operation
of
the
Off
Balance
Sheet
Facility
(
"
OBSF
"
)
which
commenced
two
weeks
before
the
year
end
.
The
uncertainty
generated
by
the
revocation
of
AA
's
signoff
for
the
facility
late
in
the
year
end
audit
.
The
discovery
of
a
number
of
'
bugs
'
within
the
AS400
Merchanting
code
,
arising
from
the
release
of
OBSF
designed
functionality
,
which
compounded
the
operational
burden
of
supporting
the
OBSF
.
The
requirement
to
amend
the
operational
process
and
OBSF
IT
code
as
a
result
of
the
current
renegotiation
of
the
OBSF
with
Barclays
(
and
AA
)
.
The
senior
IT
developer
for
Merchanting
has
resigned
and
been
sent
on
gardening
leave
.
The
Corporate
requirement
to
lower
working
capital
usage
for
the
Merchanting
business
irrespective
of
the
above
parochial
business
issues
.
Various
mitigating
actions
have
been
and
will
be
taken
to
provide
focus
,
gain
comfort
over
control
levels
and
to
provide
assurance
to
senior
management
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
Q1
DPR
and
business
balance
sheet
.
The
implementation
for
SAP
for
the
Merchanting
business
has
been
delayed
and
effectively
decoupled
from
the
higher
risk
(
higher
benefit
)
Brokerage
implementation
-
benefit
is
to
provide
sole
focus
on
OBSF
for
IT
Merchanting
developers
.
The
AR
/
AP
SAP
data
quality
reviews
for
both
businesses
are
continuing
so
as
to
provide
a
detailed
analysis
as
at
end
Q1
.
Middle
Office
have
instigated
a
new
daily
working
capital
report
process
tracking
cash
settlement
/
funding
data
to
working
capital
components
for
all
Metals
businesses
.
An
enhanced
position
signoff
process
will
be
implemented
prior
to
end
Q1
covering
gross
tonnage
,
spread
positions
and
summarised
analyses
for
brand
and
locations
.
The
necessary
report
functionality
should
be
available
within
the
AS400
,
however
contingencies
have
been
initiated
to
build
tactical
VBA
/
excel
reports
outside
of
the
AS400
but
using
AS400
data
downloads
.
User
requests
for
additional
AS400
functionality
and
reports
have
been
aggressively
prioritised
and
a
code
freeze
will
commence
prior
to
the
end
of
Q1
following
the
delivery
of
three
reports
determined
as
minimum
requirements
for
the
support
of
OBSF
.
A
resubstantiation
of
the
full
Q1
DPR
will
be
completed
by
the
Risk
control
staff
reconciling
the
full
trial
balances
between
Q1
open
and
Q1
close
A
full
internal
balance
sheet
review
will
be
completed
within
the
Q1
audit
timetable
which
incorporates
A
full
circularisation
of
inventory
balances
,
and
matching
to
source
documentation
within
Enron
Inspection
of
certain
of
the
above
inventory
balances
,
by
third
party
inspectors
,
where
there
is
an
expectation
that
circularisation
replies
will
not
be
received
on
a
timely
basis
Substantive
checks
back
to
source
contract
documentation
for
the
forward
priced
and
unpriced
positions
report
(
spot
checking
the
key
position
report
signed
off
by
the
traders
)
Full
reconciliation
and
recalculation
of
OBSF
option
premium
values
Full
reconciliation
of
contracts
within
the
OBSF
to
Barclays
documentation
(
thereby
substantiating
existence
of
stock
that
we
have
option
to
purchase
)
and
to
AS400
Barclays
account
A
risk
based
debtors
review
-
matching
to
source
documentation
,
where
applicable
,
and
any
subsequent
post
quarter
end
cash
movements
A
full
substantiation
of
creditors
to
internal
(
contract
commitments
)
or
external
documentation
(
invoices
/
request
for
payment
)
A
full
reconciliation
of
intercompany
accounts
A
full
substantive
reconciliation
of
cash
and
funding
accounts
I
intend
to
provide
weekly
updates
on
the
status
of
the
above
actions
during
April

Dr.
Harris
:
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
personally
taking
the
time
to
closely
review
my
application
.
Though
I
am
disappointed
with
the
results
I
am
still
determined
to
attend
The
TEXAS
Graduate
School
of
Business
next
year
.
I
understand
how
competitive
the
process
has
become
,
but
I
felt
that
with
my
work
experiences
,
recommendations
,
personality
,
extracurricular
activities
,
etc.
that
this
would
compensate
for
my
disability
.
After
talking
with
Professors
Titman
,
Ronn
,
Brown
and
Jemison
,
I
was
sure
that
the
School
was
the
right
place
to
get
the
education
I
was
looking
for
.
I
am
still
certain
that
the
School
is
the
best
place
for
getting
a
great
graduate
-
level
education
,
so
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
am
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
in
next

.
I
plan
on
taking
two
or
three
graduate
level
finance
courses
at
the
University
of
Houston
this
Summer
and
Fall
to
demonstrate
to
the
Admissions
committee
that
I
can
compete
at
the
graduate
level
.
I
also
plan
on
retaking
the
GMAT
test
.
Due
to
my
disability
,
this
will
be
a
monumental
task
;
but
I
am
determined
to
prove
to
the
Committee
that
I
can
be
successful
at
The
TEXAS
Graduate
School
of
Business
.
I
would
like
to
come
down
to
Austin
this
spring
to
meet
with
you
to
further
discuss
my
application
file
and
to
personally
meet
you
.

of
anything
else
I
can
do
to
strengthen
my
overall

for
next

In
the
end
,
the

were
not
favorable

I
understand

Sorry
about
that
,
I

working
on
the
Teco
O&M
costs
.
Thanks
Ben
Please
send
me
an
excel
spreadsheet
which
depicts
the
value
that
you
see
associated
with
the
heat
rate
spread
option
.
I
want
to
make
sure
that
I
understand
exactly
how
you
propose
valuing
the
transaction
and
how
this
value
would
be
booked
.
As
such
,
please
provide
the
following
detail
:
Will
we
be
valuing
/
booking
a
series
of
monthly
call
options
or
a
series
of
daily
call
options
?
What
power
curve
are
we
valuing
the
deal
against
-
PJM
East
or
West
Hub
?
Please
send
me
the
current
fuel
curve
that
you
are
converting
to
$
/
MWh
to
value
the
deal
?
What
volatilities
are
you
using
to
value
the
options
-
monthly
volatilities
or
intra-day
volatilities
or
a
blend
of
the
two
(
if
blending
please
show
me
what
formula
you
using
to
blend
the
two
vols
)
?
What
expiration
date
are
you
using
,
i.e.
:
for
monthly
call
options
the
15th
of
the
relevant
month
,
and
for
daily
options
?
What
correlation
are
you
assuming
,
15
%
flat
for
twenty
years
?
Are
you
deducting
all
operating
expenses
from
the
value
of
the
option
?
Are
you
using
the
"
SPRDOPT
"
Exotic
Options
function
to
value
the
option
?
Are
you
using
the
$
/
MWh
VOM
dollar
amount
as
your
strike
?
Has
Don
provided
the
fixed
payment
stream
?
This
stream
should
be
covering
both
P&I
and
not
just
principal
.
Yvan
,
and
Ben
,
please
provide
answers
to
these
question
via
written
correspondence
so
that
their
is
limited
probability
of
misunderstanding
.
Thank
you
both
very
much
for
your
time
and
help
thus
far
.
Furthermore
,
I
would
like
to
reiterate
that
RAC
's
goal
,
prior
to
quoting
any
credit
reserve
,
is
to
be
100
%
confident
that
:
(
i
)
the
methodology
that
is
being
employed
is
consistent
among
the
internal
groups
;
and
(
ii
)
the
inherent
value
of
the
price
risk
management
contracts
matches
.
This
enables
RAC
to
manage
the
associated
risk
during
the
life
of
the
transaction
both
effectively
and
appropriately
.

Randy

this

automatically
have
alerted
us
to
peak
loading
conditions
on
CDEC
's
system
.
We
had
a
pretty
good
idea
when
we
signed
the
contract
that
ECS
would
not
be
able
to
complete
that
by
the
contract
start
date
,
so
we
negotiated
a
fall
back
plan
under
which
ECS
is
obligated
to
"
assist
[
Transwestern
]
in
developing
a
manual
system
to
accomplish
the
same
result
and
will
hold
harmless
and
keep
[
Transwestern
]
whole
for
all
cost
and
expenses
"
associated
with
the
manual
system
.
We
will
fight
with
them
about
who
owes
the
$
200
k
that
James
mentions
below
based
on
their
failure
to
"
assist
"
us
in
managing
the
cost
.
In
the
mean
time
,
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
get
a
handle
on
the
situation
to
mitigate
future
costs
.
Do
we
have
someone
who
is
watching
this
out
there
?
We
are
running
so
full
tilt
on
TW
that
we
may
not
have
as
much
flexibiltiy
to
manage
this
situation
as
we
expected
,
but
let
me
know
what
we
can
do
.
James
had
heard
that
one
hold
up
was
the
absence
of
a
confidentiality
agreement
--
I
guess
between
ECS
and
Transwestern
--
that
would
permit
ECS
to
communicate
to
us
the
details
on
how
to
access
teh
key
info.
from
CDEC
.
That
sounds
like
a
BS
excuse
from
ECS
,
but
it
that
's
what
they
are
saying
,
let
me
know
and
we
can
figure
out
a
solution
.
Thanks
.

Would
you
please
contact
Gerald
Nemec
and
review
the
Gallup
Compression
Service
Contract
in
respect
to
the
Load
Control
Management
.
My
understanding
was
that
ECS
was
to
provide
a
means
to
access
CDEC
's
online
profile
in
order
for
us
to
make
a
decision
to
avoid
running
the
compressor
during
CDEC
's
peak
load
periods
.
We
have
not
received
access
to
this
information
which
has
resulted
so
far
in
additional
electric
cost
of
$
200,987.33
for
the
period
of
July
through
September
.
Additional
cost
will
be
incurred
for
the
remainder
of
this
year
,
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
review
yet
.
This
cost
is
averaging
$
79,000
per
month
if
we
continue
to
run
the
compressor
as
we
have
in
August
and
September
.
Good
point
,
but
I
'm
comfortable
we
're
covered
because
our
bidders
were
all
bidding
on
a
chunk
of
capacity
and
primary
points
.
They
are
deemed
to
be
on
notice
that
they
had
alternate
point
rights
(
it
s
in
the
tariff
)
and
if
they
wanted
to
submit
a
bid
that
had
a
different
rate
for
primaries
and
alternates
,
they
could
have
done
so
.
None
of
them
did
,
and
most
importantly
,
the
winning
bidders
did
not
.
Our
letter
agreement
simply
memorializes
that
we
will
charge
the
same
negotiated
rate
whether
the
gas
flows
on
primaries
or
alternates
.
I
assume
from
your
message
you
are
OK
with
this
and
they
can
get
it
nailed
down
?
DF
I
just
got
done
looking
at
the
underlying
contract
language
as
set
forth
in
the
pro
forma
service
agreement
in
the
tariff
and
it
specifically
says
that
the
max
rate
would
apply
unless
a
discount
or
negotiated
rate
has
been
agreed
to
.
My
concern
with
adding
the
language
below
is
,
could
it
be
argued
that
not
everyone
knew
the
rate
would
or
could
apply
at
any
point
,
since
we
just
stated
Topack
and
Needles
and
if
they
knew
they
might
have
bid
a
different
rate
??

After

I

that
redlined
language
be
added
to
the

Dynegy
agreement
and
to
the
4
other
negotiated
rate
agreements
we

done

In
discussion
with
Dave

we
thought
it
would
be
good
to
put
this
together
in
a
format
of
questions
and
answers
.
However
,
as
you
will
see
,
the
questions
I
thought
of
got
kinda
long
-
but
I
think
we
need
answers
for
all
of
them
.
One
thought
is
to
have
just
the
agenda
as
a
couple
topics
and
then
lead
in
with
the
first
two
questions
as
I

listed

I
believe
you
got
a
copy
of
the
John
Sommer
letter
to
producers
dated
Jan
6
that
MKM
's
spies
intercepted
.
She
forwarded
the
Sommer
letter
to
Stan
and
discussed
it
with
him
.
Dari
and
I
vented
our
aggravation
by
drafting
the
attached
letter
to
Gibson
and
Kyle
complaining
of
Sommer
's
duplicity
,
but
after
tempers
cooled
,
MKM
and
I
decided
not
to
send
it
to
Stan
or
urge
him
to
send
a
written
response
.
As
it
stands
,
MKM
and
I
will
probably
bring
it
up
with
Sommer
in
OK
City
and
strongly
suggest
the
importance
of
coordinated
communication
to
the
producers
.
Stan
may
also
bring
the
letter
up
orally
next
time
he
's
on
the
phonne
with
Gibson
or
Kyle
as
an
example
of
how
not

handle
this

Jean
&
Thane
--
Can
we
have
a
meeting
this
week
(
maybe
Thursday
at
3:30
)
to
discuss
this
?
Jim
We
do
need
a
formal
plan
.
We
have
been
working
closely
together
to
identify
the
issues
as
they
develop
and
propose
solutions
.
Doug
has
been
providing
us
with
the
necessary
specific
market
information
.
We
have
been
successful
in
communicating
that
information
to
the
new
commissioners
and
Ercot
and
seeking
resolution
.
The
commission
is
definitely
more
responsive
to
market
participants
that
are
articulating
the
issue
,
providing
specific
examples
and
proposing
the
solution
.
Grand
-
standing
is
ignored
.
Those
who
show
up
with
complaints
but
can
not
point
to
specifics
are
virtually
ignored
.
Those
who
show
up
and
complain
,
but
are
not
participating
in
the
working
groups
and
the
daily
Ercot
phone
calls
,
board
meetings
,
etc.
are
ignored
.
Doug
and
I
met
with
the
Chairman
of
PUCT
and
have
had
subsequent
conversations
.
Thane
and
I
also
visited
with
him
.
Pat
Wood
made
a
phone
call
to
Tom
Noel
and
told
him
to
get
the
Texas
market
fixed
.
(
Even
though
he
has
bigger
things
to
do
in
D.C.
,
this
is
his
legacy
and
he
recognizes
that
if
deregulation
does
not
work
in
Texas
,
the
repercussions
could
be
global
.
)
Chairman
Sibley
and
Chairman
Wolens
(
of
the
Texas
legislature
)
are
also
engaged
in
market
developments
.
We
have
been
working
with
the
State
Affairs
legislative
committee
and
keeping
them
apprised
.
There
is
an
Electric
Restructuring
Committee
hearing
scheduled
for
September
6th
or
7th
.
The
forum
is
expected
to
be
invited
testimony
only
.
Those
currently
listed
as
invitees
are
PUCT
Commissioners
and
Ercot
's
Sam
Jones
and
Tom
Noel
.
The
hearing
is
focused
on
the
pilot
and
we
have
an
opportunity
to
provide
some
probing
questions
for
Wolens
to
direct
to
Sam
and
Tom
.
Now
that
Sibley
is
not
a
candidate
for
Lt.
Governor
,
there
is
more
freedom
to
open
up
and
ask
some
difficult
questions
.
Thane
is
in
Austin
on
Friday
,
but
is
available
by
phone
.
I
will
be
on
a
plane
to
Houston
at
8:00
a.m
.
Can
we
find
another
time
that
works
for
us
to
meet
?
Thane
is
in
an
Ercot
PRS
meeting
Friday
from
9:30
until
3:00
.
I
am
available
after
Rick
's
Friday
budget
meeting
...
are
you
available
then
?
You
are
right
,
we
do
need
a
formal
plan
,
Thane
has
started
an
initial
draft
.
Thanks
,
Jean
Jean
&
Thane
--
Walking
out
last
night
,
Kevin
Presto
indicated
that
there
were
games
being
played
in
ERCOT
with
the
new
market
rules
and
prices
in
certain
markets
were
not
reflective
of
working
markets
.
Enron
needs
to
use
this
situation
to
quickly
get
our
viewpoints
up
into
the
PUCT
and
ERCOT
ISO
on
what
is
driving
these
problems
and
our
proposed
fixes
.
If
ERCOT
goes
the
way
of
California
-
either
due
to
market
power
or
poor
market
design
rules
-
it
will
be
a
bad
day
for
deregulation
and
for
Pat
Wood
.
As
important
,
the
new
PUCT
Commissioners
need
some
help
right
now
in
messaging
the
market
.
Let
's
get
them
to
support
constructive
solutions
that
will
make
a
real
difference
.
Jean
and
Thane
,
I
think
that
we
need
a
FORMAL
PLAN
on
what
to
do
over
the
next
3
-
6
months
to
leverage
this
situation
.
I
would
like
to
discuss
this
with
you
on
Friday
am
.
I
am
free
at
8
am
on
Friday
before
Rick
's
budget
meeting
.
Jim
FYI
.
You
may
want
to
discuss
with
Becky
.

As

of
the
meeting
Leslie
and
I
had
with
Scott
and
Hunter
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
we
have
begun
work
to
develop
an
electronic
tool
that
would
allow
us
to
provide
ongoing
summaries
of
FERC
gas
activities
,
and
possibly
electric
activities
,
in
a
format
that
can
be
linked
to
the
Fundamentals
intranet
site
used
by
the
traders
.
We
envision
a
format
that
would
provide
a
brief
summary
and
analysis
of
the
order
,
filing
,
etc.
with
a
link
to
the
source
document
as
well
for
those
who
would
like
more
detailed
information
.
This
would
replace
the
paper
copies
you
and
your
people
are
currently
getting
.
Many
details
remain
to
be
worked
out
,
but
we
will
keep
you
advised
.
In
the
meantime
,
could
you
please
provide
a
contact
on
your
side
with
whom
we
could
discuss
technical
issues
?
What
do
I
need
to
do
?

I
am
forwarding
for
your
attention
the
resume
of
Peter
Percell
who
has
an
extensive
experience
in
modeling
physical
flows
of
natural
gas
in
pipeline
systems
.
Peter
is
looking
currently
for
a
job
.
I
met
him
last
week
at
the
meeting
of
the
Science
and
Industry
Advance
with
Mathematics
society
at
the
University
of
Houston
.
The
application
of
recent
developments
in
optimization
theory
and
numerical
methods
can
help
Enron
to
improve
further
efficiency
of
our
pipeline
system
and
reduce
the
consumption
of
compressor
fuel
.
Please
,
let
me
know
if
you
interested
in
introducing
Peter
to
executives
in
your
organization
.
I
shall
be
glad
to
make
arrangements
for
an
interview
.

I
enjoyed
your
presentation
,
and
meeting
you
briefly
afterwards
,
at
the
SIAM
Workshop
last
Friday
.
I
have
extensive
experience
as
a
technical
leader
in
the
design
and
development
of
modeling
and
simulation
software
products
,
mostly
for
the
oil
and
gas
pipeline
industry
.
I
am
looking
for
a
position
that
can
utilize
my
software
development
and
mathematical
skills
.
Getting
out
of
the
narrow
confines
of
the
pipeline
simulation
industry
would
be
a
plus
.
Please
consider
whether
I
might
fit
in
your
group
.
Your
answer
to
a
question
indicated
that
I
have
several
of
the
skills
you
look
for
.
Also
,
please
let
me
know
,
by
email
,
the
names
and
contact
information
of
other
managers
within
Enron
who
might
benefit
from
having
someone
with
my
qualifications
in
their
group
.
Attached
are
my
resume
and
an
addendum
covering
academic
&
consulting
experience
.
Publications
are
available
on
request

I
will
call
you
in

of

you
for

,
Please
review
the

With

,
EOL
does
request
a
new
Password
Application
for
the
applicant
reflecting
the
name
as
you
noted
below
.
When
the
company
is
set
up
in
the
EOL
database
we
link
the
company
to
the
Parent
and
reference
the
CP
ID
.
Sam
,
please
confirm
,
Global
Counterparty
also
provides
the
links
to
establish
correlation
between
the
parent
and

for
our

this

Re

It
was
my
understanding
with
the
EOL
Team
that
all
divisions
would
have
the
legal
incorporated
entity
as
part
of
the
name
.
Stephanie
,
I
my
preference
is
to
kick
their
Password
Application
back
and
get
them
to
change
it
to
read
something
like
"
Cargill
Ferrous
International
,
a
division
of

"
or
"
Cargill

We
informed
Tana
that
we
made
the
change
in
Global
Counterparty
to
include
,
"
a
division
of
Cargill
Incorporated
"
.
We
will
meet
in
the
near
future
to
discuss
the
issues
surrounding
division
and
trade
name
setups
in
Global
Counterparty
.
Bill
Bill

If
Sam
's
description
below
of
the
GCP
procedure
is
correct
,
it
looks
to
me
like
something
needs
to
be
changed
.
The
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
confirmation
system
reads
the
counterparty
's
name
from
Global
Counterparty
.
Since
divisions
of
companies
are
not
legal
entities
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
contract
in
their
own
names
.
If
the
correct
legal
name
is
not
in
Global
Counterparty
,
the
confirmation
goes
out
with
the
wrong
legal
name
on
it
seriously
compromising
the
contract
itself
.
That
is
the
source
of
Tana
's
concern
regarding
the
correct
entering
of
divisions
in
the
system
.
My
suggestion
is
that
Global
Counterparty
use
the
same
name
that
the
customer
has
signed
on
the
EnronOnline
Password
Application
--
my
understanding
is
that
the
EnronOnline
team
returns
inappropriate
Applications
to
the
customer
until
they
are
correctly
completed
.
In
this
particular
case
since
the
counterparty
is
still
not
allowed
to
transact
on
EnronOnline
almost
a
month
after
sending
in
their
application
they
are
understandably
upset
and
are
now
complaining
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
get

FYI
...
Cargill
Ferrous
International
is
set
up
correctly
in
the
Global
Counterparty
System
as
a
Division
of
Cargill
,
Inc
.
Cargill
Ferrous
International
is
the
full
name
of
this
division
and
set
up
as
such
in
GCP
with
a
Sub
-
to
-
Legal
Link
to
Cargill
,
Inc.
per
GCP
procedure
.
Also
,
the
Global
SAP
team
(
Cheryl
Johnson

would
need
Legal
Name
Change
documentation
from
the
Counterparty
in
order
to
change
this

.

Any

on

Hello
,
Yes
,
GCP
provides
the
links
to
establish
the
correlation
between
the
parent
and
child
for
our
downstream
systems
.
GCP
procedure
is
to
create
Counterparty
names
that
reflect
either
the
Tradename
/
Division
name
or
Parent
Name
--
not
both
simultaneously
.
(
Although
,
we
have
broken
that
rule
for
Legal
in
the
past
.
)
This
defeats
the
purpose
of
using
a
Tradename
.
Best
Rgds
.
Samuel
Tana
,
Please
review
the
process
below
:
With
divisions
,
EOL
does
request
a
new
Password
Application
for
the
applicant
reflecting
the
name
as
you
noted
below
.
When
the
company
is
set
up
in
the
EOL
database
we
link
the
company
to
the
Parent
and
reference
the
CP
ID
.
Sam
,
please
confirm
,
Global
Counterparty
also
provides
the
links
to
establish
correlation
between
the
parent
and
child
for
our
downstream
systems
.
Let
me
know
if
this
is
the
appropriate
steps
that
you
would
like
to
see
.
Thanks

Re
:
Cargill
Ferrous
International
It
was
my
understanding
with
the
EOL
Team
that
all
divisions
would
have
the
legal
incorporated
entity
as
part
of
the
name
.
Stephanie
,
I
my
preference
is
to
kick
their
Password
Application
back
and
get
them
to
change
it
to
read
something
like
"
Cargill
Ferrous
International
,
a
division
of
Cargill
,
Inc.
"
or
"
Cargill
,
Inc.
acting
through
its

To
Whom
It
May
Concern
:
Through
TV
and
newspapers
,
I
hear
constantly
about
identity
fraud
using
stolen
social
security
information
.
I
am
very
concerned
about
this
issue
.
I
have
the
following
suggestion
for
our
company
.
Since
Enron
's
employees
are
assigned
an
SAP
identification
numbers
(
P
number
)
and
an
HR
number
,
could
Enron
as
a
company
use
these
IDs
instead
of
the
SS
numbers
?
This
will
be
safer
for
all
employees
.
For
example
,
I
am
concerned
when
I
buy
the
monthly
bus
passes
and
I
have
to
fill
in
my
SS
number
.
I
do
not
feel
secure
at
all
to
see
my
SS
in
so
many
databases
at
Enron
,
especially
when
some
databases
are
from
third
-
parties
(
out
-
sourcing
)
.
We
could
use
our
badge
number
there
instead
of
our
SS
.
Please
let
me
know
how
your
organization
can
help
the
Enron
employees
feel
safer
about
the
safeguard
of
their
SS
number
.
Please
calendar
and
print
for
my
files
on
this
meeting
.
Thanks
.

as

FYI
re
:
NEPCO
picketing
issues
.
Michelle
Michelle
,
Two
in
one
day
.
We
understand
that
the
pipe
fitters
are
also
planning
to
picket
the
Lake
Worth
,
Florida
project
as
well
.
Our
execution
team
needs
to
get
some
guidance
and
planning
for
this
picketing
should
it
interfere
with
the
progress
of
the
work
.
In
that
respect
,
we
need
to
dial
in
Rick
Johnson
and
Olgletree
to
plan
and
communicate
that
plan
to
the
execution
team
.
I
think
the
first
step
is
a
call
between
yourself
,
me
,
Mark
Stubley
and
Mike
Indivero
.
And
then
another
call
with
all
folks
or
a
meeting
at
the
jobsite
to
lay
out
the
plan
.
Barbara
,
please
organize
a
call
for
Mike
,
Michelle
,
Mark
Stubley
and
me
.
Thanks
.
David
,
I
have
been
advised
by
our
Construction
Manager
,
Mr.
Joe
Osler
that
while
he
was
visiting
the
City
of
Lake
Worth
Building
Planning
and
Zoning
dept
regarding
our
permit
status
he
learned
that
the
pipefitters
have
inquired
about
permit
requirements
to
picket
our
site
.
Apparently
the
City
informed
them
that
no
permit
is
required
.
I
have
heard
that
the
pipefitters
have
established
a
picket
line
at
the
Payne
Creek
site
today
.
We
will
need
local
legal
counsel
to
assist
us
in
this
regard
.
Mike
Indivero
,
I
understand
that
Mr.
Mike
Croall
's
release
date
from
NEPCO
is
Oct
31
,
2001
.
Please
advise
as
to
who

replacement
is

working
on
guidelines
for
Argentina
which
will
address
both
physical
and
financial
trading
.
Other
"
guidelines
"
exist
in
limited
form
for
the
remote
offices
in
Singapore
and
Australia
.
I
am
checking
on
London
.
I
'm
not
exactly
certain
as
to
what
you
are
looking
for
.
Obviously
the
foreign
offices
have
issues
that
may
not
apply
in
the
US
(
although
LA.
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
third
world
country
)
.
One
thing
that
does
n't
show
up
in
the
attachment
is
the
swap
eligibility
issue
.
Let
me
know
how
I
can
help
further
.

printed

laminated
it
.
Becky
will
bring
you
the
hard

version
.
Lunch
date
later
.
see
below
.
It
looks
like
the
2
-
day
L/C
issue
is
an
issue
.
I
'll
call
you
shortly
.
Joseph
Manogue
at
Tiger
called
me
last
night
to
say
he
had
finally
reviewed
the
draft
ISDA
doc
with
all
agreed
changes
put
in
and
lined
from
original
.
He
faxed
it
to
you
and
will
have
the
original
Fedexed
overnight
.
Hope
you
'll
have
time
to
review
it
today
.
S&S
has
again
asked
about
the
gtee
and
l/c
wording
.
They
do
not
have
anything
from
us
in
writing
confirming
the
agreed
changes
.
Joe
asked
that
you
fax
the
revised
gtee
wording
that
has
been
agreed
(
I
believe
it
was
our
agreeing
to
reduce
the
claim
period
from
15
days
down
to
5
)
and
the
new
l/c
wording
(
drops
the
2
day
period
to
replace
an
l/c
with
a
different
bank
if
the
first
refuses
to
pay
)
.
I
know
we
talked
about
these
issues
earlier
,
but
Tiger
's
lawyers
want
to
get
everything
agreed
in
writing
now
so
final
docs
can
be
issued
for
signing
,
even
if
we
are
the
one's
issuing
the
gtee
and
l/c
.
Thanks
!
Call
if
you
have
questions
or
if
I
can
be
of
any
help
.
There
is
an
outside
chance
we
could
have
everything
set
to
go
this
week

Confidential
Settlement
Document
Per
CPUC
Rule
51
Gas
Accord
II
Settlement
Participants
:
Attached
is
PG&E
's
Gas
Accord
II
(
GA
II
)
Settlement
Proposal
.
We
believe
it
addresses
many
of
the
issues
and
concerns
you
have
raised
in
the
workshops
.
As
an
overview
,
this
proposal
:
*
Maintains
the
basic
Gas
Accord
structure
in
place
today
for
the
period
2003
to
2007
.
*
*
Offers
end
user
transportation
rates
for
2003
lower
for
most
customers
than
rates
in
effect
today
.
*
*
Provides
for
vintaged
Redwood
path
rates
for
core
customers
.
*
*
Offers
a
7.5
cent
/
dth
rate
to
large
customers
while
minimizing
rate
changes
to
other
customers
,
minimizing
the
incentive
for
these
customers
to
seek
to
bypass
local
transmission
charges
and
other
CPUC
-
approved
charges
.
*
*
Adopts
guidelines
to
improve
reliability
and
help
moderate
prices
in
gas
commodity
markets
,
and
identifies
the
capital
projects
needed
to
meet
these
guidelines
over
the
course
of
the
GA
II
period
(
2003
-
2007
)
.
*
*
Provides
a
high
degree
of
rate
stability
,
with
a
3.5
%
escalator
to
capture
both
inflation
and
the
cost
of
needed
capital
projects
.
The
guaranteed
rates
will
be
adjustable
only
for
significant
changes
in
the
cost
of
capital
or
increased
costs
due
to
governmental
requirements
or
catastrophic
events
.
*
*
Preserves
a
rate
differential
between
the
Redwood
and
Baja
paths
,
although
somewhat
less
than
the
current
differential
.
*
*
Proposes
a
two
-
stage
open
season
for
firm
transportation
services
beginning
in
2003
,
with
end
users
receiving
a
first
option
on
available
capacity
.
*
*
Maintains
the
core
aggregation
program
with
some
adjustments
.
PG&E
also
anticipates
that
the
Core
Procurement
Incentive
Mechanism
(
CPIM
)
will
be
similar
to
today
's
mechanism
,
but
will
reflect
the
somewhat
larger
capacity
holdings
needed
to
meet
anticipated
increases
in
core
demand
and
to
meet
a
1
-
day
in
10
-
year
cold
weather
event
.
This
also
will
serve
as
a
reminder
that
an
all
-
Party
meeting
is
scheduled
at
PG&E
's
headquarters
in
San
Francisco
on
January
10
and
11
,
to
discuss
this
proposal
and
to
respond
to
your
questions
.
We
look
forward
to
answering
your
questions
and
receiving
your
feedback
.
The
attached
documents
include
the
GA
II
Settlement
proposal
,
an
Attachment
(
a
copy
of
PG&E
's
proposed
Gas
Rule
27
)
,
and
a
set
of
supporting
workpapers
.
Finally
,
please
note
that
the
Settlement
document
and
the
Attachment
are
in
"
Word
2000
"
format
.
We
would
be
glad
to
provide
the
same
documents
in
an
earlier
version
of
Word
,
upon
request
by
individual
Parties
.
We
look
forward
to
seeing
you
on
January
10
-
11
.
In
the
meantime
,
we
extend
our
best
wishes
for
a
safe
and
happy
holiday
season
.

Jeff
-
instead
of
suggesting
a
specific
rate
increase
-
10
or
15
%
,
I
think
we
should
acknowledge
that
a
"
modest
"
increase
may
be
necessary
and
may
in
fact
be
desirable
-
but
that
the
specific
amount
of
increase
should
be
reasoned
and
subject
to
well
thought
out
evidence
and
hearings
,
not
just
determined
by
whim
.
In
general
,
we
should
not
be
overly
prescriptive
at
this
point
and
I
know
you
agree
with
that
.
Otherwise
,
I
think
you
have
captured
the
points
excellently
.
We
're
in
the
process
of
developing
a
strategy
to
take
us
through
the
next
few
months
.
But
while
the
(
otherwise
perishable
)
thoughts
are
still
fresh
in
my
mind
from
the
hearings
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
,
I
wanted
to
throw
out
some
observations
for
discussion
in
the
days
/
weeks
ahead
.
OBSERVATION
--
The
pressure
to
finger
somebody
for
"
price
gouging
"
is
increasing
.
The
administration
is
hell
bent
on
finding
a
"
fall
guy
.
"
The
price
spikes
pose
real
political
risks
for
Davis
and
he
and
his
folks
need
and
want
an
easy
way
out
.
His
press
release
following
the
hearing
renewed
the
call
for
"
refunds
.
"
On
my
panel
,
Loretta
Lynch
asked
Reliant
and
Duke
to
supply
her
with
the
details
of
the
contracts
they
cut
to
sell
their
power
forward
to
marketers
.
And
Carl
Wood
's
remarks
were
extreme
.
At
the
Barton
hearing
,
a
liberal
democrat
(
Filner
)
and
a
conservative
Republican
(
Hunter
)
locked
arms
in
calling
for
refunds
.
Bilbray
joined
the
"
gouging
"
band
wagon
.
The
utilities
repeatedly
called
on
FERC
to
do
a
"
real
"
investigation
,
with
hearings
,
testimony
,
data
discovery
---
the
works
.
On
the
positive
side
,
the
FERC
commissioners
lauded
Wolak
,
his
analysis
,
and
his
remarks
on
the
panel
.
Wolak
said
somewhat
emphatically
that
the
nature
of
California
's
market
structure
makes
it
impossible
to
single
out
a
single
participant
as
the
culprit
.
He
also
stated
that
just
everyone
's
just
acting
in
their
own
self
-
interest
,
responding
to
the
screwed
incentives
embedded
in
the
structure
.
IMPLICATION
--
It
seems
prudent
for
Enron
to
understand
better
its
risks
of
getting
fingered
.
In
the
best
case
,
the
clamoring
for
a
"
refund
"
subsides
.
In
which
case
,
the
only
cost
to
Enron
is
the
internal
cost
incurred
to
understand
better
the
risks
of
getting
fingered
.
In
the
medium
case
,
investigations
find
that
Enron
(
like
others
)
"
played
by
the
rules
,
"
but
the
rules
stunk
,
and
Enron
profited
at
the
expense
of
California
consumers
.
You
're
right
,
Sue
.
Rates
ca
n't
go
up
w/out
declaring
the
rate
freeze
over
in
some
fashion
---
trying
to
finesse
it
.
Thanks
very
much
for
the
comments
.
Harry
also
had
a
good
comment
---
do
n't
specify
the
amount
of
rate
increase
in
our
comments
;
rather
note
that
the
rate
increase
needs
to
be
well
-
reasoned
and
based
on
facts
and
evidence
.
Will
make
that
change
.

Tom
Byargeon
,
Kevin
Miller
and
Ken
Loch
in
ENA
are
working
with
producers
in
the
US
involved
in
deep
water
offshore
Louisiana
/
Texas
oil
and
gas
drilling
projects
.
This
financing
activity
was
primarily
started
to
help
ENA
secure
long
term
well
head
and
pipeline
natural
gas
supplies
to
supplement
the
gas
trading
desk
activities
.
Just
like
what
happened
in
Enron
's
initial
VPP
program
they
are
find
more
interest
in
oil
drilling
projects
rather
than
natural
gas
projects
.
They
are
currently
working
on
a
bid
(
due
1/31
)
for
the
Medusa
project
which
involves
Murphy
(
operator
)
,
Agip
and
Callon
in
Mississippi
Canyon
Blocks
#
538
and
#
582
.
The
initial
reservoir
reports
estimate
reserves
of
80
-
120
million
barrels
of
sour
crude
and
they
estimate
initial
production
to
be
40,000
bpd
starting
in
1Q
2003
.
Quality
is
estimated
to
be
a
Mars
type
crude
with
25
-
27
API
Gravity
and
1.5
-
2.0
%
sulfur
.
Plans
are
to
build
a
private
pipeline
to
Equilon
's
West
Delta
#
143
platform
and
then
bring
the
oil
onshore
.
Peggy
is
finding
out
where
WD
#
143
pumps
to
onshore
.
Tom
's
group
would
like
to
know
if
we
have
any
interesting
in
buying
the
crude
on
either
a
fixed
or
floating
basis
.
The
floating
could
be
tied
to
a
Platt
's
index
or
the
NYMEX
.
It
is
far
too
early
to
expect
Murphy
to
enter
into
a
physical
or
financial
contract
,
but
Tom
hopes
to
get
us
first
and
/
or
last
look
from
Murphy
when
the
time
is
right
.
Another
alternative
is
to
give
Murphy
barrels
at
their
95,000
bpd
Meraux
,
Louisiana
refinery
in
exchange
for
the
new
production
barrels
.
Could
someone
in
your
group
please
give
me
a
notional
non
binding
basis
differential
for
this
quality
of
crude
for
Cal
2003
?

following
up
on
our
discussion
yesterday
;
for
these
types
of
deals
,
i
do
nt
think
it
s
necessary
to
have
all
the
documentation
of
our
counterparty
's
authorization
to
enter
into
the
agreement
.
these
are
short
term
transactions
and
requiring
this
documentation
will
cause
us
to
lose
business
because
competitive
alternatives
do
not
have
such
burdensome
requirements
.
the
primary
reason
we
need
these
things
is
for
the
scenario
where
a
muni
does
a
derivative
deal
with
an
open
-
ended
downside
,
loses
$
50
million
,
and
then
claims
that
it
was
not
a
valid
contract
.
in
our
case
,
they
are
only
hedging
.
we
are
collecting
a
premium
up
front
and
their
total
cost
is
known
up
front
.
therefore
they
will
not
attempt
to
make
this
claim
.
even
if
they
did
,
our
risk
is
limited
to
the
premium
,
not
some
big
payout
.
the
risk
of
losing
business
is
far
greater
than
the
risk
of
a
counterparty
trying
to
get
their
premium
back
.
seems
like
a
5
second
decision
to
me
.
is
it
possible
to
combine
the
standard
isda
and
our
confirm
into
a
single
long
form
?
by
going
away
from
the
standard
isda
maybe
we
can
eliminate
these
requirements
because
the
payout
liability
is
only
1
-
way
.

That
girl
's
mother
sounds
like
a
real
problem
.
I
'm
not
sure
how
I
would
have
handled
it
.
How
's
school
going
?
Any
plans
for
the
weekend
?

What
happened
?
Here
's
a
story
...
as
I
was
waiting
at
the
bus
stop
(
7:35
am
)
to
go
to
school
,
a
lady
approached
me
and
asked
if
I
'd
make
sure
her
daughter
got
on
a
certain
bus
.
The
mother
was
running
late
for
work
and
could
not
wait
.
I
could
n't
say
no
...
so
Nicki
(
the
little
girl
-
10
yrs.
old
)
and
I
waited
for
the
bus
.
It
was
now
,
8:15
and
there
was
no
sign
of
her
bus
.
On
top
of
things
,
I
had
quiz
at
8
am
.
Which
I
then
realized
I
missed
.
I
decided
that
Nicki
would
just
have
to
wait
on
her
own
.
I
asked
her
if
she
had
any
relatives
that
would
want
to
know
of
her
whereabouts
.
I
called
her
grandmother
and
explained
things
to
her
.
Pretty
strange
...
aye
.
A
bus
that
runs
through
UofH
arrived
and
I
almost
got
on
without
her
,
but
I
could
n't
do
it
.
Finally
,
I
told
the
little
girl
that
she
would
have
to
accompany
me
to
school
(
8:30
am
)
.
There
were
only
15
minutes
left
of
class
.
I
stayed
for
the
remainder
of
the
lecture
.
After
class
we
went
back
to
bus
stop
and
within
minutes
her
bus
arrived
.
I
told
the
bus
driver
where
to
drop
her
off
.
I
notified
her
grandmother
with
the
time
of
the
departure
.
And
I
was
relieved
when
Nicki
called
to
let
me
know
she
was
home
safe
.
Please
send
the
memo
to
the
EGM
business
heads
as
well
.
Thanks
.

All

The
Analyst
and
Associate
Programs

we
have
many
Analyst

While
we
anticipate
many
new
Analysts

(
late
May
)
and
fulltime

Cycle
Recruiting
event
.

are
planning
this

Wayne
Jen
,
please
take
care
of
this
for
EGM
Marianne
:
The
following
are
my
comments
:
1
.
In
Section
1.1
,
there
should
be
a
parentheses
after
etc.
in
the
5th
line
.
2
.
In
Section
3.1
,
in
the
last
sentence
after
the
proviso
insert
"
a
"
before
the
word
"
change
"
and
after
the
word
"
in
"
.
3
.
In
Section
6.1
,
change
20
Business
Days
to
20
days
.
Also
,
add
a
semicolon
at
the
end
of
clause
(
i
)
.
4
.
In
Section
6.2.1
I
'll
just
note
that
the
discount
rate
sentence
I
think
is
still
an
open
issue
.
5
.
In
Section
6.3
,
clause
(
c
)
should
be
reworded
to
fit
with
the
language
in
the
beginning
of
the
Section
.
6
.
Capitalize
the
word
"
facility
"
in
the
definition
of
Average
Annual
Load
Factor
.
7
.
Delete
the
definition
of
Costs
as
it
is
already
defined
in
Section
6.2.1
.
8
.
Where
is
the
defined
term
Govt
Authority
used
?
9
.
In
the
GTC
,
the
ECP
rep
should
also
apply
to
EESI
.
Also
,
in
the
7th
line
of
the
reps
add
the
word
"
into
"
after
the
word
"
entered
"
and
before
the
word
"
this
"
.
10
.
In
Collateral
Requests
,
insert
a
comma
after
deposit
in
the
last
line
.
I
will
also
add
granting
/
perfection
language
.
11
.
In
Events
of
Default
,
clause
(
a
)
refers
to
a
dispute
section
which
I
'm
not
sure
exists
.
In
clause
(
e
)
,
delete
the
"
s
"
:
from
the
word
consolidation
.
12
.
Remedies
should
be
deleted
as
it
is
already
covered
in
Section
6.1
.
13
.
In
UCC
/
Disclaimer
of
warranties
,
add
a
clause
(
c
)
.
I
would
add
setoff
language
.

AM
Carol
:
I
have
attempted
to
incorporate
the
changes
that
Jim
has
incorporated
in
our
long
form
power
agreement
which
ENA
has
suggested
to
date
into
the
short
form
.
Attached
please
find
a
sample
short
form
(
for
the
Con
Ed
market
)
for
your
review
.
Please
note
the
following
as
you
review
:
1
.
The
short
forms
do
not
contain
the
optionality
relating
to
our
performing
billing
services
--
all
of
our
midmarket
forms
anticipate
that
we
will
act
as
customer
's
billing
agent
and
that
we
will
collect
all
amounts
due
related
to
T&D
and
the
like
from
the
customer
(
and
reflect
same
on
our
invoice
)
and
pass
those
amounts
on
to
the
customer
's
utility
.
2
.
I
did
not
include
a
"
Setoff
"
provision
in
this
draft
,
mainly
because
the
vast
majority
of
the
time
,
we
will
not
,
nor
will
an
affiliate
,
have
another
agreement
in
place
with
these
customers
.
If
you
feel
strongly
about
our
including
a
setoff
provision
,
we
will
do
so
.
3
.
The
change
in
law
provision
reads
a
bit
differently
from
the
long
form
--
the
thinking
here
is
that
the
long
form
language
is
very
lengthy
and
rather
harsh
(
and
we
've
had
great
difficulty
selling
it
in
the
past
)
.
Taking
into
consideration
this
class
of
customer
,
we
decided
to
include
certain
items
,
including
our
inability
to
cover
our
costs
due
to
a
change
in
law
,
rules
or
practices
as
a
"
force
majeure
event
"
in
an
effort
to
soften
the
approach
(
see
the
GTCs
)
.
Also
we
do
not
address
calculation
of
a
termination
payment
in
the
event
of
a
change
in
law
as
the
long
form
does
--
again
,
more
in
the
interest
of
"
saving
space
"
than
anything
else
...
Let
us
know
your
thoughts
on
this
document
and
if
you
are
comfortable
with
our
using
this
until
such
time
as
the
hybrid
form
is
launched
.
If
you
are
comfortable
,
we
will
drive
these
changes
into
our
other
midmarket
power
forms
.
Thanks
again
for
your
help
with
this
project
,

his
list

He
needs
more
info

these
trades
(
i.e.
,
price
info
)
and
would
like
to
talk
with
you
about
it
.
His
number
is

address
is

Once
we
agree
on
the

I
think
Valerie
Mooney
(
our
credit
person
)
and
Ed
Sacks
are
still
discussing
some
minor
fine
tuning
of
the
LOC
format
.
I
spoke
to
Bob
Bruce
this
morning
-
we
're
all
set
on
the
language
in
the
Schedule
to
the
ISDA
,
and
there
is
a
minor
credit
/
billing
issue
in
Paragraph
13
related
to
the
timing
of
transfer
of
interest
on
collateral
that
Val
will
discuss
with
Ed
as
well
.
As
far
as
the
EEI
goes
,
the
only
remaining
issue
that
I
'm
aware
of
(
aside
from
finalizing
the
LOC
)
is
whether
we
've
finished
coordinating
the
Attachment
containing
the
list
of
prior
transactions
.
Sounds
like
we
may
actually
get
these
documents
executed
early
next
week
.

Our
credit
person
does
n't
understand
why
the
transferability
language
needs
to
be
eliminated
.
It
simply
refers
to
the
same
ICC
publication
for
the
transfer
process
that
governs
the
letter
of
credit
generally
.
Is
there
some
specific
concern
that
we
can
address
?
Russell
:
Your
comments
to
the
transfer
agreement
were
fine
.
With
respect
to
the
Guaranty
,
I
will
delete
the
Schedule
.
Our
system
did
not
show
any
other
chnages
.
Were
there
any
?

All
,
Please
see
the
attached
Interconnect
Agreement
with
Questar
.
I
wanted
you
all
to
have
a
look
at
what
we
believe
is
the
final
draft
.
It
is
a
fairly
standard
,
fully
reimbursable
interconnect
with
Questar
.
Transwestern
will
own
and
operate
the
interconnect
.
You
will
notice
that
Questar
has
requested
a
"
Payment
Plan
"
that
details
when
they
will
pay
Transwestern
for
the
interconnect
due
to
the
recent
Enron
events
.
If
anyone
has
any
questions
or
concerns
about
the
timing
of
these
payments
,
please
give
me
a
call
.
Also
,
you
will
notice
this
interconnect
may
not
be
subject
to
the
CIAC
tax
gross
up
,
but
to
protect
ourselves
,
we
have
added
language
in
Para
3.2
that
protects
us
financially
if
the
IRS
ever
comes
back
to
determine
that
this
interconnect
is
subject
to
the
CIAC
tax
.
Robert
Guthrie
with
the
tax
department
has
worked
with
us
to
develop
this
language
.
We
hope
to
execute
this
Agreement
this
week
.
If
you
have
any
comments
,
please
let
me
know
.
After
execution
,
we
will
forward
a
final
copy
to
you
for
your
files
.

Earl
,
We
are
looking
at
putting
the
metering
facilities
on
their
ROW
(
also
,
I
think
we
will
have
to
purchase
about
50
ft
of
ROW
from
ElPaso
to
get
to
Questar
's
property
)
.
As
you
look
at
this
,
if
for
some
reason
we
can
not
obtain
ElPaso
ROW
,
we
will
have
to
look
at
Plan
B
which
would
be
to
put
the
metering
on
our
ROW
.
Our
in
-
service
date
is
May
1
.
If
you
think
that
May
1
may
be
difficult
due
to
receiving
the
parts
/
materials
on
a
timely
basis
because
of
the
issues
that
vendors
may
have
with
us
because
of
recent
Enron
events
,
please
let
me
know
.
Questar
has
already
informed
us
that
they
would
help
obtain
parts
/
materials
to
our
specifications
if
it
helps
achieve
an
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
.
Thanks
,
Kim
.
Kim
Has
a
location
,
Theirs
or

been
settled

when
is
the
required
in

date

The

it
will
take
someone
with

good
skills
in
organizing

.
It
will
also
require
someone
who
is
fairly

someone
who
might
fit

Mansoor

Let
's
discuss
.
Kim
.
Kim
The
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
,
will
be
very
difficult
to
attain
.
Since
the
bankruptcy
filing
,
vendors
have
been
very
reluctant
to
ship
material
prior
to
it
being
prepaid
(
Daniels
,
Fisher
,
Rosemont
,
other
)
.
These
are
the
vendors
of
instrumentation
required
for
the
interconnect
.
Questar
may
be
able
to
purchase
material
,
but
some
of
the
items
can
have
up
to
a
60
day
delivery
.
(
From
time
PA
approved
and
funded
to
in
-
service
will
be
75
days
at
most
.
We
have
worked
with
Daniels
on
a
chromatograph
on
another
project
and
prepayment
has
taken
45
days
alone
.
Daniels
is
not
set
up
for
prepayments
as
they
bill
off
an
invoice
and
the
main
office
and
accounting
had
to
create
an
invoice
for
a
chromatograph
that
had
not
been
delivered
.
Not
the
usual
mode
of
operations
.
The
I/C
design
is
for
a
UltraSonic
meter
and
this
is
dependent
on
their
testing
schedule
(
Canada
or
Kansas
are
the
only
two
places
to
test
to
100
%
of
design
)
.
Will
confirm
testing
schedule
and
delivery
dates
with
UltraSonic
ASAP
.
We
will
try
to
complete
the
I/C
with
the
earliest
in
-
service
date
possible
,
but
with
conditions
as
they
are
,
a
realistic
date
would
be
June
15
,
2002
.
If
you
have
questions
or
issues
,
please
let
me
know
.

Earl
,
We
are
looking
at
putting
the
metering
facilities
on
their
ROW
(
also
,
I
think
we
will
have
to
purchase
about
50
ft
of
ROW
from
ElPaso
to
get
to
Questar
's
property
)
.
As
you
look
at
this
,
if
for
some
reason
we
can
not
obtain
ElPaso
ROW
,
we
will
have
to
look
at
Plan
B
which
would
be
to
put
the
metering
on
our
ROW
.
Our
in
-
service
date
is
May
1
.
If
you
think
that
May
1
may
be
difficult
due
to
receiving
the
parts
/
materials
on
a
timely
basis
because
of
the
issues
that
vendors
may
have
with
us
because
of
recent
Enron
events
,
please
let
me
know
.
Questar
has
already
informed
us
that
they
would
help
obtain
parts
/
materials
to
our
specifications
if
it
helps
achieve
an
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
.
Thanks
,
Kim

Listening
to
the
Edison
call
w/
investors
Edison
says
they
will
pay
everyone
at
the
same
time
(
"
big
bang
"
approach
)
sometime
in
Q1
'02
.
My
concern
is
that
between
now
and
then
Dunn
,
the
AG
have
the
time
and
resources
to
make
a
heckuvalot
of
mischief
,
which
could
be
detrimental
to
generators
/
marketers
'
claims
.
Investors
are
asking
what
Edison
intends
for
QFs
and
generators
--
asking
about
haircuts
in
particular
--
and
Edison
is
side
-
stepping
the
questions
.
Great
.
Figured
they
'd
contacted
them
,
but
wanted
to
make
sure
.
You
know
when
the
meeting
with
schedulers
will
be
?
I
apologize
,
I
'm
on
the
road
and
have
n't
heard
when
that
will
be
.
I
'm
thinking
that
I
may
want
to
attend
.
Thanks

Electricity
:
A
panel
focuses
on
price
hikes
and
the
actions
of
the
ISO
president
.
September
26
,
2001
By
KIMBERLY
KINDY
The
Orange
County
Register
SACRAMENTO
A
state
Senate
committee
is
set
today
to
start
serving
16
subpoenas
on
electricity
producers
and
officials
who
manage
California
's
energy
grid
to
determine
whether
they
acted
in
concert
to
manipulate
energy
prices
.
The
investigative
committee
,
headed
by
state
Sen.
Joe
Dunn
,
D
-
Santa
Ana
,
is
focusing
on
a
series
of
events
last
fall
filled
with
enough
Shakespearean
plot
twists
and
intrigue
that
it
has
earned
a
name
around
the
Capitol
:
"
the
palace
coup
.
"
Lawmakers
and
consumer
groups
allege
that
the
events
-
directed
by
the
man
who
heads
the
state
's
energy
grid
-
fueled
the
California
energy
crisis
,
pushed
the
state
into
the
power
-
buying
business
and
helped
make
billions
of
dollars
for
power
producers
.
The
central
question
behind
the
palace
coup
is
whether
Terry
Winter
,
the
president
of
the
Independent
System
Operator
,
acted
alone
when
he
took
steps
to
remove
key
price
caps
designed
to
limit
the
amount
power
generators
could
charge
.
Winter
defied
his
own
board
and
Gov.
Gray
Davis
when
he
filed
a
50
-
page
request
to
remove
the
caps
,
records
and
interviews
show
.
I
do
n't
know
how
these
events
could
have
taken
place
without
some
concerted
effort
,
said
Dunn
.
The
subpoenas
will
force
those
involved
,
including
Winter
,
to
provide
sworn
testimony
about
the
events
to
the
committee
,
and
to
turn
over
e-mails
,
personal
calendars
and
memos
.
Davis
spokesman
Steve
Maviglio
said
the
governor
felt
"
betrayed
"
by
the
actions
of
Winter
.
The
governor
believes
it
was
the
defining
moment
,
when
what
was
a
mounting
problem
turned
into
an
instant
crisis
,
Maviglio
said
.
Winter
refused
comment
,
referring
all
questions
to
the
public
relations
office
.
ISO
spokesman
Gregg
Fishman
said
Dunn
's
committee
will
find
no
criminal
conduct
.
The
decision
was
made
by
ISO
upper
management
with
one
goal
in
mind
:
to
keep
the
lights
on
.
At
the
time
,
generators
were
refusing
to
sell
power
in
California
because
of
the
price
caps
.
It
was
an
emergency
,
Fishman
said
.
What
became
known
as
the
palace
coup
began
on
Oct.
26
when
ISO
board
members
voted
for
severe
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
money
electricity
producers
could
charge
for
power
.
The
restrictions
would
drive
prices
as
low
as
$
65
per
megawatt
-
nearly
12
times
below
the
$
750
per
megawatt
limits
of
seven
months
earlier
.
They
(
electricity
generators
)
grinned
and
beared
the
$
750
price
cap
,
but
this
new
plan
by
ISO
was
too
much
,
said
Dunn
,
whose
committee
has
been
investigating
since
March
.
Records
show
that
on
Oct.
31
,
power
generators
and
electricity
traders
filed
letters
with
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
,
demanding
that
the
new
plan
be
killed
.
The
letters
,
six
in
all
,
were
sent
within
two
hours
of
each
other
and
represented
dozens
of
power
generators
.
Although
there
is
nothing
illegal
about
the
generators
acting
together
to
lobby
against
price
caps
,
Dunn
believes
the
letters
and
other
actions
around
the
same
time
showed
clear
coordination
among
energy
officials
.
He
said
the
main
aim
of
the
subpoenas
will
be
to
determine
whether
collusion
occurred
to
"
fix
"
prices
,
which
would
violate
federal
trade
laws
.
In
the
Oct.
31
letters
,
electricity
producers
told
federal
officials
that
if
price
caps
were
n't
removed
it
would
lead
to
a
collapse
of
the
energy
market
.
The
generators
got
their
way
.
The
next
day
,
the
federal
commission
killed
the
new
pricing
plan
.
What
was
left
in
place
was
a
$
250
price
cap
established
five
months
earlier
.
Power
producers
then
turned
their
attention
toward
killing
that
cap
,
saying
they
could
n't
make
a
profit
even
under
these
constraints
.
They
began
to
withhold
power
from
California
,
and
on
Dec.
7
the
ISO
declared
its
first
Stage
3
emergency
and
braced
for
blackouts
,
which
were
narrowly
averted
.
What
followed
the
next
day
is
considered
by
the
governor
and
Dunn
to
be
the
pivotal
moment
of
the
energy
crisis
.
Winter
,
who
in
his
position
as
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
the
ISO
,
submitted
a
50
-
page
emergency
request
,
asking
federal
officials
to
abolish
the
$
250
price
cap
.
Final
authority
over
lifting
the
cap
rested
with
the
federal
government
.
Neither
the
ISO
board
,
which
had
established
the
price
cap
,
nor
the
governor
learned
of
Winter
's
actions
until
the
cap
had
been
removed
.
In
fact
,
the
attorney
who
helped
draft
the
emergency
request
,
Charles
Robinson
,
was
in
a
meeting
with
representatives
of
the
governor
and
ISO
board
members
just
hours
before
the
filing
was
made
.
He
did
n't
mention
anything
about
it
.
With
the
price
caps
gone
,
the
generators
filed
paperwork
with
federal
regulators
justifying
higher
costs
.
This
action
accelerated
the
utilities
'
move
toward
bankruptcy
and
forced
the
governor
to
move
the
state
into
the
power
-
buying
business
.
"
Prices
for
electricity
jumped
from
an
average
of
$
249
a
megawatt
to
$
700
a
megawatt
within
three
days
,
ISO
records
show
.
Dunn
believes
the
resulting
overcharges
for
electricity
exceeded
$
30
billion
.
Robinson
said
the
filing
-
granted
two
hours
after
the
request
-
helped
rather
than
hurt
Californians
.
Prices
,
he
said
,
did
not
spike
as
a
result
.
Instead
they
followed
the
skyrocketing
price
of
natural
gas
-
which
is
used
to
run
power
plants
to
generate
electricity
.
Robinson
said
the
emergency
order
allowed
the
ISO
to
secure
refunds
should
overcharges
for
electricity
be
proven
to
federal
officials
.
We
felt
we
made
it
better
because
it
introduced
a
process
for
review
and
refund
.

Jan
Smutney
-
Jones
,
who
was
the
ISO
board
chairman
at
the
time
and
executive
director
of
a
group
that
represents
power
generators
,
said
Winter
did
not
consult
him
about
eliminating
the
price
cap
.
Smutney
-
Jones
also
said
he
was
unaware
of
anyone
in
the
power
-
generating
community
being
consulted
.
He
did
what
he
thought
had
to
be
done
at
the
time
to
keep
the
power
flowing
.
The
ISO
board
called
an
emergency
meeting
the
next
week
demanding
Winter
explain
his
actions
.
Some
board
members
pushed
to
have
Winter
removed
,
but
there
were
concerns
such
action
would
lead
to
more
chaos
,
the
governor
's
spokesman
Maviglio
said
.
James
J.
Hoecker
,
the
former
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
chairman
,
defended
making
the
December
decision
and
also
defended
Winter
.
They
(
ISO
management
)
did
what
any
independent
system
operator
would
do
.
What
Dunn
's
committee
hopes
to
learn
is
why
all
these
events
transpired
.
He
believes
memos
and
e-mails
around
the
time
of
Winter
's
Dec.
8
actions
should
provide
vital
clues
.
We
do
n't
know
why
he
did
what
he
did
,
but
we
are
eager
to
find
out
,
Dunn
said
.
We
should
resurrect
Mike
Smith
's
note
and
get
him
on
the
call
in
the
attempt
to
avoid
recreating
the
wheel
on
this
one
.
I
can
dig
it
up
if
you
'd
like
.
Sue
and
Jeff
--
I
am
having
a
meeting
with
Vicki
and
Janet
Dietrich
on
Thursday
to
discuss
our
view
on
the
ability
to
extend
our
current
contracts
in
CA
(
for
customers
already
on
DA
)
.
Can
we
discuss
this
today
or
soon
thereafter
.
My
take
is
that
the
UDCs
will
be
indifferent
to
this
(
maybe
?
)
and
our
#
1
priority
is
to
work
to
get
the
PG&E
model
adopted
across
the
state
.
Any
news
on
how
SCE
and
SDG&E
will
move
forward
?
Thanks
.
Sounds
good
.
I
suggest
a
"
blind
draw
"
on
the
teams
,
best
ball
not
scramble
on
the
golf
,
and
as
for
the
wager
,
no
emails
from
the
losing
team
for
one
week
!
Is
there
any
question
?
I
'll
leave
to
Steve
to
structure
the
deal
.
As
I
recall
,
Montavano
,
Shapiro
and
I
usually
make
up
one
team
,
but
I
'm
willing
to
switch
around
a
bit
.
Best

Are
you

It
's
a
two
way
street
,
of
course
.
Have
they
expressed
any
interest
in
negotiating
?
There
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
REAL
negotiation
,
but
nothing
particularly
helpful
about
generating
one
that
s
just
for
show
.
Particularly
in
the
absence
of
any
entreaty
from
them
.
Where
is
the
"
simple
"
explanation
of
the
transportation
piece
?
As
I
have
told
RNR
,
I
think
we
should
advise
Duke
in
writing
that
its
IP
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
contract
,
since
it
is
in
the
alternative
,
and
that
our
IP
is
hence
the
only
one
that
will
be
before
the
arbitrators
(
since
Duke
clearly
can
not
change
it's
ineffective
IP
at
this
stage
,
having
already
seen
ours
)
.
Accordingly
,
the
only
issue
left
for
arbitration
is
whether
our
IP
(
the
only
one
and
therefore
the
one
they
have
to
choose
)
is
or
is
not
an
economic
hardship
under
the
contract
.
What
say
ye
?

,
I
have
no

actins
Enron
has
pending
in

but
I
will
call
Richard
Sanders
who
manages

litgation
here
.
I
've
read
the
materials
you
sent
and
agree
we
need
to
address
these
allegations
appropriately
.
Richard
do
you
have
any
bad
faith
litigation
pending
against
any
insurers
in
Texas
or
are
you
aware
of
any
Enron
has
filed
??
We
sued
Houston
Casualty
last
year
but
I
do
n't
recall
making
any
bad

claims
.
It
settled
anyway
,
a
long

ago
.
mb
Michelle
,
Did
you
get
my

on
Friday
?
I
guess
the
questions
on
which
I
should
like
your
steer
are
:
(
a
)
Do
you
have
a
particular
sensitivity
about
the
reference
to
bad
faith
proceedings
made
by
United
India
?
(
b
)
Is
it
right
that
Enron
has
3
sets
of
bad
faith
proceedings
in
Texas
?
(
c
)
Are
you
happy
with
the
draft
letter
to
Beachcrofts
I
sent
you
?
Please
give
me
a
call
if
you
would
like
to
discuss
.
Justin
Not
when
I

I
was

Michelle

were
you

If

chance
today
,
I
should
be
really
grateful
if
one
of
you
could
give
me
a
call
to

;
I

we
should

clearly
on
this
in

without

Dear
Mr.
Sanders
-
?
While
I
left
a
you
a
phone
message
with
some
information
about
our
project
,
I
thought
I
could
give
you
some
additional
details
by
e-mail
as
well
...
?
We
are
still
very
interested
in
having
Enron
support
our
eCommerce
Dispute
Management
Protocol
.?
We
have
had
enthusiastic
responses
from
companies
such
as
AT&T
,
Duke
Energy
,
Pitney
Bowes
and
Daimler
Chrysler
,
and
I
would
be
pleased
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
have
about
this
focal
point
for
our
educational
efforts
.?
The
real
purpose
of
my
call
,
however
,
is
related
to
the
services
we
will
provide
to
support
the
aspirational
statements
of
the
Protocol
.
I
am
a
member
of
the
design
group
that
has
been
developing
the
American
Arbitration
Association
's
dispute
management
systems
and
services
for
eCommerce
B2B
transactions
.?
At
this
time
we
are
putting
together
small
working
groups
to
validate
some
of
our
assumptions
and
refine
our
initial
service
offerings
.
Initially
our
design
group
,
along
with
perhaps
one
of
our
technology
consultants
,
would
like
to
meet
with
a
group
of
Enron
people
for
half
a
day
.?
Ideally
this
group
would
consist
of
four
to
six
people
from
finance
,
legal
,
and
operations
so
that
we
get
good
cross-functional
feedback
about
our
services
.?
Before
the
meeting
we
would
provide
you
with
a
brief
description
of
our
proposed
service
offerings
and
a
list
of
points
for
discussion
at
the
meeting
.
The
real
focus
of
the
meeting
will
be
on
how
we
should
build
these
services
to
meet
the
needs
of
businesses
operating
in
B2B
marketplaces
.?
We
are
very
concerned
with
providing
services
that
are
relevant
to
that
environment
.
We
would
like
to
meet
between
November
14
and
?
December
1
?
since
construction
of
our
services
is
already
underway
.?
Please
let
me
know
what
is
possible
,
and
feel
free
to
give
me
a
call
if
you
have
any
questions
(
978-376-9004
)
.
?
Thanks

the
industry
of
Marriage
and
Kids
,
you
heard
me
.
Marriage
is
,
in
and
of
itself
,
a
noble
concept
,
but
it
too
often
leads
to
kids
and
kids
flat
out
suck
.
How
can
I
say
such
an
abomination
,
ask
you
?
Look
around
you
and
notice
all
the
mind
numbing
trailor
trash
cretins
out
there
who
should
not
be
procreating
,
yet
they
do
.
These
are
the
people
who
keep
Jerry
springer
on
the
air
.
These
are
the
kids
who
will
destroy
society
,
because
of
the
crapfest
the
American
family
has
become
under
the
post
hippie
culture
,
you
heard
again
.
And
you
might
think
by
reading
this
I
blame
the
kids
.....
Not
so
,
Kids
are
what
kids
are
and
will
do
what
they
do
.
It
is
literally
monkey
see
and
monkey
do
with
them
.
That
will
likely
never
change
.
It
's
the
bad
parents
out
there
who
fuck
up
their
lives
and
do
nt
seem
to
understand
that
once
you
decide
to
have
kids
,
it
is
indeed
time
to
grow
up
and
be
a
responsible
role
model
for
those
kids
.
Very
few
parents
do
this
.
And
this
is
a
direct
result
of
the
Politically
correct
,
permissive
,
time
out
granting
bullshit
liberal
culture
that
has
caused
this
.
When
you
blame
it
all
on
society
,
there
's
noone
to
to
take
responsibility
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
generation
of
fucked
up
kids
who
are
likley
smoking
,
drinking
,
doing
drugs
,
fucking
the
neighbor
or
some
internet
perv
just
because
you
are
too
lazy
to
see
waht
they
're
doing
.
People
like
this
will
never
have
my
sympathy
,
nor
do
they
deserve
my
sympathy
.
Look
inside
yourselves
parents
,
is
this
you
?
Probably
it
is
.
Fuck
you
.
Stop
trying
to
pawn
your
brats
off
on
others
to
"
get
a
break
"
.
You
made
a
choice
to
be
a
mommy
,
you
do
nt
get
a
break
until
they
move
out
,
that
s
the
choice
that
you
madea
and
that
's
life
.
Tough
shit
.
Just
because
you
're
stuck
,
does
nt
give
you
the
right
to
drag
down
all
the
singles
around
you
.
Another
time
I
'll
segueway
into
all
the
fun
work
related
instances
where
"
Mommies
"
get
out
of
doing
work
and
hiding
behind
childcare
as
the
reason
.
This
is
the
insidious
conspiracy
I
call
"
Mommism
"
.
It
must
be
stamped
out
.

(

)
It
looks
like
NASA
is
ready
to
sour
again
after
it's
devastating
loss
from
the
Columbia
accident
which
occurred
nearly
two
years
ago
.
Now
,
NASA
engineers
and
astronauts
are
almost
giddy
with
"
go
"
fever
as
the
tentative
date
for
the
first
launch
since
the
Columbia
disaster
approaches
.
The
most
important
question
is
n't
whether
Discovery
is
technically
ready
to
fly
with
new
safety
features
and
emergency
procedures
,
but
whether
the
agency
itself
has
learned
from
the
crucial
errors
most
common
to
Challenger
and
Columbia
,
errors
that
grew
out
of
a
management
culture
that
discouraged
criticism
and
sacrificed
safety
for
image
-
puffing
and
budget
-
cutting
.
I
hope
so
.
Seeing
another
"
Columbia
"
incident
can
be
quite
frightening
(
I
woke
up
to
it
early
in
the
morning
when
I
was
in
Texas
)
.
We
do
n't
need
another
incident
as
exploring
the
cosmos
is
something
that
keeps
our
imagination
going
as
a
species
.
Maybe
one
day
they
will
allow
space
tourism
,
(
hopefully
that
will
be
in
the
near
future
)
although
I
would
recommend
that
NASA
build
new
shuttles
instead
of
trying
to
preserve
the
older
ones
.
You
do
have
to
give
NASA
credit
on
some
things
as
they
have
eliminated
the
"
fear
of
reporting
failure
"
culture
that
probably
led
to
the
lack
of
reporting
defects
on
the
Columbia
shuttle
.
Instead
they
are
encouraging
everyone
to
come
forward
if
they
see
any
potential
problems
(
as
it
is
clear
that
overlooked
problems
could
result
in
unnecessary
losses
)
.
But
supporters
are
pointing
a
few
good
things
out
:
Clearly
,
the
agency
has
worked
hard
at
tackling
the
technical
challenges
posed
by
a
superb
and
surprisingly
independent
-
minded
investigative
panel
.
A
few
weeks
ago
,
shuttle
workers
at
the
Kennedy
Space
Center
received
a
rocket
-
like
boost
in
morale
with
two
important
deliveries
for
the
next
shuttle
to
carry
.
One
is
a
special
tool
to
detect
damage
to
the
thermal
-
protective
tile
while
in
orbit
-
something
the
Columbia
crew
would
have
welcomed
.
The
other
is
a
new
fuel
tank
"
guaranteed
"
by
NASA
not
to
shed
potentially
fatal
hunks
of
insulation
.
NASA
has
some
PR
hurdles
to
overcome
in
the
future
.
But
let
s
hope
for
their
sake
(
and
the
sake
of
all
space
lovers
out
there
)
that
they
can
redefine
their
image
and
rekindle
the
hope
of
space
colonization
again
.

Healing
the
Collective
Body
In
George
Orwell
's
influential
novel
"
1984
"
doublethink
is
a
device
promoted
by
the
totalitarian
state
government
to
make
people
accept
two
irreconcilable
ideas
at
the
same
time
such
as
"
war
is
peace
"
.
I
see
the
merit
in
flowing
with
duality
.
One
of
my
most
cherished
dualities
is
the
understanding
that
we
are
both
autonomous
individuals
with
the
power
to
shape
our
personal
destinies
and
at
the
same
time
we
are
all
one
,
that
there
is
no
separation
between
you
and
I
,
we
are
all
together
in
this
thing
called
life
,
we
human
beings
,
the
birds
and
the
tress
,
the
rocks
and
the
sky
,
all
of
it
.
I
have
written
a
lot
recently
about
healing
the
self
so
today
here
are
a
few
words
on
healing
our
collective
body
,
mind
and
soul
.
Think
of
all
life
,
if
you
will
,
as
one
great
choir
or
one
grand
congregation
.
Our
strength
is
in
our
unity
and
harmony
.
Any
major
dischord
and
we
all
suffer
.
Any
insult
to
the
collective
good
brings
us
all
down
.
Living
out
of
synch
with
nature
is
the
great
disease
,
from
that
flows
all
the
tributaries
we
have
come
to
think
of
as
sickness
.
We
are
only
as
strong
as
our
weakest
,
we
are
only
as
healthy
as
the
sickest
amongst
us
-
playing
sports
and
being
in
the
army
taught
me
that
lesson
before
I
was
finished
being
a
teenager
.
When
the
healthy
treat
the
sick
with
scorn
and
intolerance
it
brings
us
all
down
.
When
those
lucky
enough
not
to
have
Herpes
create
a
climate
of
shame
and
indignity
for
those
of
us
who
do
,
not
only
are
they
hurting
us
,
but
they
are
hurting
themselves
.
There
is
no
escape
from
the
collective
ocean
we
all
swim
in
.
What
you
project
will
always
come
back
to
either
reward
or
haunt
you
.
We
are
now
suffering
from
the
consequences
of
our
rape
of
the
environment
,
our
rejection
of
the
natural
for
the
industrial
,
and
our
embrace
of
violence
over
peace
.
Jesus
said
that
what
you
do
the
least
of
the
people
you
do
to
him
.
What
are
you
doing
to
the
least
of
the
people
?
If
we
are
all
in
this
thing
together
,
let
's
play
nice
.
Remember
that
what

to
yourself
affects
me
and
everybody
else
,
remember
that
what
you
do
to
me
and
anyone
else
shapes
your
destiny
.
No
matter
what
progress
we
make
as
individuals
in
becoming
healthier
,
we
will
never
achieve
real
health
until
we
collectively
decide
to
create
a
healthier
reality
.
Fortunately
circumstances
will
force
our
hand
soon
since
our
collective
bad
behaviour
can
not
continue
indefinitely
.
In
the
near
future
collective
choices
will
need
to
be
made
.
Will
we
choose
to
live
in
harmony
with
this
planet
or
crash
and
burn
in
a
conflagration
of
arrogance
and
disregard
?
Will
we
choose
to
rise
about
prejudice
and
intolerance
or
go
down
kicking
and
screaming
with
holding
on
to
fear
and
anger
?
There
is
no
health
without
peace
and
no
peace
without
health

Revolutionary
Compensation
Agel
has
created
a
new

structure
that

will
produce
some
of
the
largest
checks
in
network
marketing
history
.
The
plan
ca
n't
be
described
as

a
unilevel
,
or

forced
matrix

your

Namaskar
Hi
All
!
We
now
present
the
kaoshikii
dance
,
which
is
excellent
before
and
after
yoga
postures
.
I
encourage
you
to
do
this
dance
,
as
it
has
tremendous
positive
effects
.
It
is
a
dance
for
both
males
and
females
.
Dharma
--
Kaoshikii
is
a
dance
which
was
invented
in
1978
by
Shrii
Shrii
A'nandamu'rti
.
It
is
a
psycho-spiritual
exercise
and
benefiting
the
mind
by
developing
stamina
and
strength
.
Kaoshikii
is
especially
good
for
women
.
It
can
ward
off
and
cure
a
number
of
diseases
,
keeps
the
body
youthful
and
enables
an
easy
delivery
in
childbirth
.
Kaoshikii
comes
from
the
Sanskrit
word
'
kosa
'
meaning
shell
or
layer
of
mind
.
The
self
of
the
individual
lies
hidden
in
the
innermost
layers
of
existence
(
kosas
)
.
Thus
kaoshikii
is
a
blossoming
of
the
microcosm
(
unit
being
)
in
its
attempt
to
attain
a
link
with
the
Macrocosm
(
Cosmic
Consciousness
)
.
This
attempt
is
normally
referred
to
as
mysticism
.

The
Dance
The

the
hands
together

over
the
head
.
Then
to
the
beat
of
"
dhin

,
ta'
,
ta'
"
,
the
dancers
begin
their
step
,
placing
the

In
the
final
two
steps
,
the

stamp
their
feet
on
the
ground
.
Kaoshikii

as
many
rounds

When
the
dancers
start
the
step
with
the
beat
of
"
dhin

dhin

Quebecker
wins
U.S.
bravery
award
Pittsburgh
-
A
Quebec
man
was
awarded
a
Carnegie
Medal
for
bravery
on
Monday
for
saving
two
friends
by
fighting
off
a
polar
bear
with
a
pocket
knife
two
years
ago
on
Baffin
Island
Dr.
Eric
Fortier
,
34
,
of
Gatineau
,
Que.
,
used
a
pocket
knife
to
attack
a
polar
bear
on
Baffin
Island
,
just
south
of
the
Arctic
Circle
,
to
save
two
friends
who
were
being
mauled
.
All
of
the
research
and
all
of
the
preparation
I
did
leading
up
to
the
trip
gave
no
indication
that
there
were
bears
in
the
Soper
[
River
]
valley
where
we
were
canoeing
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
,
an
orthodontist
,
learned
there
was
at
least
one
polar
bear
in
the
central
region
of
Baffin
Island
in
July
2001
when
he
felt
what
he
thought
was
a
dog
leaning
on
his
tent
wall
.
My
first
thought
was
to
push
it
away
,
he
said
.
A
few
seconds
later
my
girlfriend
saw
the
shadow
of
a
bear
's
paw
through
the
tent
fly
and
then
it
started
ripping
through
the
ceiling
.
The
polar
bear
is
more
dangerous
than
most
other
bears
.
The
latter
usually
consider
human
beings
a
threat
but
the
polar
bear
considers
humans
a
snack
,
experts
said
.
The
two
screamed
to
frighten
the
bear
and
warn
their
friends
in
a
tent
several
metres
away
but
the
bear
ripped
into
that
tent
and
began
mauling
31
-
year
-
old
Alain
Parenteau
.
Their
screams
changed
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
I
grabbed
my
glasses
and
my
knife
and
unzipped
my
tent
and
headed
out
.
The
bear
dwarfed
the
6
-
foot
-
1
Mr.
Parenteau
,
knocking
him
to
the
ground
,
he
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
threw
a
large
rock
at
the
bear
,
distracting
it
and
allowing
Parenteau
to
escape
but
it
then
turned
on
25
-
year
-
old
Patricia
Doyon
,
who
was
in
the
same
tent
.
Again
Dr.
Fortier
threw
rocks
at
the
bear
and
again
its
target
was
able
to
escape
.
The
bear
gave
chase
and
I
gave
chase
,
he
said
.
I
was
beside
the
bear
's
head
and
I
stabbed
it
with
an
upper
cut
below
the
jaw
in
the
neck
a
couple
of
times
.
"
The
bear
ran
off
.
While
there
was
some
fur
and
blood
on
the
nine
-
centimetre
blade
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
he
does
n't
think
he
hurt
the
bear
badly
.
Both
Mr.
Parenteau
and
Ms.
Doyon
,
however
,
were
bleeding
badly
.
Dr.
Fortier
and
his
girlfriend
lashed
two
canoes
together
and
paddled
eight
kilometres
along
the
Soper
River
.
Dr.
Fortier
travelled
another
three
kilometres
by
foot
to
seek
help
in
the
nearest
settlement
.
Both
Mr.
Parenteau
and
Ms.
Doyon
were
airlifted
to
a
hospital
and
survived
,
though
Mr.
Parenteau
had
a
gash
within
a
centimetre
of
his
jugular
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
was
one
of
15
people
to
receive
the
Carnegie
Medal
on
Monday
.
The
bronze
medal
is
given
to
people
who
"
risk
their
lives
to
an
extraordinary
degree
while
saving
or
attempting
to
save
the
lives
of
others
.
"
The
other
Canadian
recipient
of
the
medal
was
Ronald
Joseph
Crawford
,
42
,
of
Hamilton
,
who
was
killed
Aug.
4
,
2002
,
while
trying
to
defend
a
Hamilton
sandwich
shop
owner
from
a
robber
wielding
a
knife
.
Mr.
Crawford
threw
several
punches
at
the
assailant
before
he
was
stabbed
in
the
heart
.

n't
suggest
a
better

Hotmail
Founder
Jack

When
Sabeer

,
he
tried
all

created
the

Hi
all
,
There
are
already
several
forums
around
the
net
focused
on
discussing
Guild
Wars
,
so
why
create
a
new
one
?
I
say
why
not
?
The
main
reason
is
Google
is
more
accessible
to
the
global
community
and
you
can
rest
assured
that
it
's
not
going
to
go
away
.
I
have
seen
great
fan
sites
suddenly
disappear
without
notice
and
for
no
reason
.
Usually
this
happens
because
the
developer
of
the
site
can
no
longer
afford
the
cost
of
bandwidth
being
used
.
That
said
,
the
maintenance
of
this
forum
is
handled
by
Google
and
thus
will
remain
reliable
and
it
will
ultimately
give
us
more
time
to
play
:)
.
I
'm
nothing
more
than
a
devoted
fan
of
the
game
myself
and
I
hope
that
this
area
can
become
a
haven
for
deep
fan
discussions
.
Regards
,
Humanpixel
Aye
!
Good
Day
Mate
!
I
m
really
looking
forward
to
Guild
Wars
.
Anyone
know
a
release
date
?
Feb
2005
Feb
2005
is
the
projected
release
date
,
although
Guild
Wars
is
made
by
ex-members
of
Blizzard
,
so
Feb
2005
could
mean
August
2006
...
Anyway
,
I
tried
to
get
a
preorder
but
no
places
were
selling
it
so
I
missed
out
on
2/3
weekend
events
.
Oh
well
,
I
'll
get
it
when
it
comes
out
in
Febuary
.
rumor
has
feb
05
on
the
calender
.
BUT
they
stated
that
they
will
take
as
long
as
it
takes
to
work
out
all
the
bugs
so
who
really
know
how
long
.
as
far
as
pre
order
go
to
and
they
have
a
list
of
major
retailers
that
carry
it
there
are
also
a
few
websites
that
you
could
order
it
off
of
.
and
a
good
reason
for
starting
this
group
....
company
firewalls
lol
;)
I
was
kind
of
curious
,
what
exactly
is
Guild
Wars
?
I
hav
n't
heard
of
it
.
Check
out
the
Guild
Wars
Web
site
at
for
more
info
about
the
game
.
It
's
a
massive
multiplayer
role
playing
game
.
The
graphics
are
without
a
doubt
the
amoung
the
best
graphics
I
have
ever
seen
for
any
game
and
I
have
been
gaming
since
the
MUD
days
.
It
's
worth
a
look
.
I
have
a
preorder
and
am
even
considering
getting
a
second
preorder
to
have
multiple
accounts
.
I
have
participated
in
all
the
weekend
beta
events
and
the
world
preview
.
The
game
is
already
100
%
functional
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
them
not
being
able
to
meet
the
Feb
05
deadline
.
Warm
greetings
to
all
in
this
GW
community
.
I
am
Lady
Kingel
and
I
hail
from
the
United
Legit
Gaming
Guilds
of
Guild
Wars
.
We
are
a
consortium
of
legit
honorable
guilds
that
was
established
in
1997
for
DI
and
we
are
now
adding
GW
to
the
list
of
games
played
.
The
alliance
is
a
pretty
straightforward
one
.
It
was
formed
to
allow
many
different
guilds
who
were
all
strictly
honorable
to
come
together
as
a
family
and
allow
them
many
people
to
game
with
.
There
are
no
other
requirements
other
than
we
ask
that
members
greet
each
new
member
and
each
new
alliance
and
also
feel
free
to
post
in
any
of
the
forums
.
We
are
also
a
group
who
is
looking
for
members
for
our
own
select
guild
called
ULGG
of
GW
...
which
is
a
part
of
the
alliance
with
the
same
name
.
We
play
in
all
aspects
of
the
game
and
we
hand
pick
our
members
.
I
would
like
to
personally
invite
each
of
you
to
visit
our
website
.
You
are
individuals
of
quality
,
and
in
our
alliance
we
seek
quality
of
member
over
quantity
of
member
.
You
will
be
asked
to
register
,
and
then
you
should
wander
over
to
the
Announce
Your
Arrival
Section
and
present
yourself
.
You
will
be
greeted
by
many
members
of
this
wonderful
family
.
I
do
hope
to
see
you
visiting
us
at
the
fire
and
we
shall
prepare
a
feast
for
you
,
as
well
.
If
you
paste
this
in
your
browser
,
it
will
take
you
directly
to
our
GW
website
.
I
extend
my
hand
to
each
of
you
in
true
friendship
,
and
honor
.
Come
and
say
hello
...
you
will
be
warmly
welcomed
!
We
are
currently
moving
to
a
new
server
,
so
we
will
be
down
for
a
while
.
I
will
inform
when
we
are
up
and
running
again
.
I
wish
all
happy
holidays
,
and
moreso
,
peace
on
earth
.

Dear

et.
al.
,
We
are
here
.
Like
it
or
not
,
for
good
or
bad
,
we
are
here
.
Who
are
we
?
We
are
the
downtrodden
and
dispossesed
,
the
self
-
torturing
,
the
disenfranchised
convicts
,
drug
and
alcohol
addicts
,
the
unemployed
and
unemployable
.
We
are
the
children
of
poverty
,
financial
and
spiritual
.
We
have
and
will
have
children
of
our
own
,
grandchildren
too
.
We
are
ex-cons
,
uninsured
,
homeless
,
of
many
colors
and
speaking
many
tongues
.
We
are
the
enemy
in
what
has
become
a
domestic
war
against
ourselves
.
And
who
are
you
?
You
who
like
the
tough
talk
of
Tough
on
Crime
?
You
who
watch
as
budgets
are
cut
in
education
and
health
care
while
you
militarize
a
police
force
?
Bullet
-
proof
vests
,
automatic
weapons
,
helicopters
,
tanks
,
robots
...
the
testosterone
is
oozing
through
the
streets
,
more
prisons
,
longer
sentences
,
tighten
the
belt
,
spartan
conditions
,
task
forces
,
gang
units
,
gun
courts
.
And
what
is
there
to
show
for
it
?
Unemployent
stays
low
because
half
the
population
oversees
those
"
out
of
the
workforce
"
,
the
dregs
,
the
rabble
,
the
enemy
?
Please
tell
me
there
is
a
deeper
reason
.
Do
you
feel
safer
?
More
humane
?
More
like
a
cohesive
society
with
a
shared
sense
of
purpose
,
who
can
identify
Us
and
Them
?
Do
you
live
in
a
gated
community
or
gentrified
neighborhood
?
By
the
way
,
have
you
read
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
US
Constitution
-
or
do
you
only
know
the
first
phrases
?
It
's
about
time
we
got
together
.
Please
know
that
I
have
yet
to
meet
a
convict
who
wants
their
child
to
be
a
thief
,
an
addict
,
a
dealer
,
a
prostitute
,
or
a
violent
individual
.
Most
of
us
still
have
hope
for
ourselves
even
when
stuck
in
the
darkest
dilemmas
,
ruts
and
catch
-
22s
.
Most
of
us
believe
in
crafting
laws
and
instilling
order
.
Many
of
us
have
burrowed
beneath
the
surface
to
find
a
spiritual
sense
of
being
,
an
understanding
force
at
least
as
powerful
as
those
we
succumbed
to
,
and
many
of
use
would
n't
escape
if
you
opened
the
front
door
.
Did
you
know
that
approximately
10
million
Americans
are
either
incarcerated
,
on
probation
,
on
parole
or
once
were
in
those
categories
?
Each
of
those
10
million
have
families
,
friends
,
neighbors
...
and
so
closer
and
closer
does
the
We
interface
with
the
You
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
time
we
talked
?
Are
you
ready
?
Can
you
accept
that
the
road
we
are
travelling
points
toward
a
grim
and
painful
future
?
Do
you
have
the
heart
to
face
monumental
failures
while
bravely
struggling
beyond
where
we
are
now
?
I
know
that
some
of
you
are
,
and
that
some
of
us
are
,
and
this
is
what
gives
me
hope
.
You
need
our
insights
just
as
we
need
your
structure
.
It
is
never
over
,
especially
when
a
real
solution
,
a
real
treatment
for
our
sickness
,
is
yet
to
begin
.

Dear
Sir
/
Madam
,
I
am
GEORGE
WALKER
BUSH
,
son
of
the
former
president
of
the
United
States
of
America
George
Herbert
Walker
Bush
,
and
currently
serving
as
President
of
the
United
States
of
America
.
This
letter
might
surprise
you
because
we
have
not
met
neither
in
person
nor
by
correspondence
.
I
came
to
know
of
you
in
my
search
for
a
reliable
and
reputable
person
to
handle
a
very
confidential
business
transaction
,
which
involves
the
transfer
of
a
huge
sum
of
money
to
an
account
requiring
maximum
confidence
.
I
am
writing
you
in
absolute
confidence
primarily
to
seek
your
assistance
in
acquiring
oil
funds
that
are
presently
trapped
in
the
republic
of
Iraq
.
My
partners
and
I
solicit
your
assistance
in
completing
a
transaction
begun
by
my
father
,
who
has
long
been
actively
engaged
in
the
extraction
of
petroleum
in
the
United
States
of
America
,
and
bravely
served
his
country
as
director
of
the
United
States
Central
Intelligence
Agency
.
In
the
decade
of
the
nineteen
-
eighties
,
my
father
,
then
vice
-
president
of
the
United
States
of
America
,
sought
to
work
with
the
good
offices
of
the
President
of
the
Republic
of
Iraq
to
regain
lost
oil
revenue
sources
in
the
neighboring
Islamic
republic
of
Iran
.
This
unsuccessful
venture
was
soon
followed
by
a
falling
-
out
with
his
Iraqi
partner
,
who
sought
to
acquire
additional
oil
revenue
sources
in
the
neighboring
emirate
of
Kuwait
,
a
wholly
-
owned
U.S.
-
British
subsidiary
.
My
father
re-secured
the
petroleum
assets
of
Kuwait
in
1991
at
a
cost
of
sixty
-
one
billion
U.S.
dollars
(
$
61,000,000,000
)
.
Out
of
that
cost
,
thirty
-
six
billion
dollars
(
$
36,000,000,000
)
were
supplied
by
King
Hussein
,
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
and
other
Persian
Gulf
monarchies
,
and
sixteen
billion
dollars
(
$
16,000,000,000
)
by
German
and
Japanese
partners
.
But
my
father
's
former
Iraqi
business
partner
remained
in
control
of
the
republic
of
Iraq
and
its
petroleum
reserves
.
My
family
is
calling
for
your
urgent
assistance
in
funding
the
removal
of
the
President
of
the
Republic
of
Iraq
and
acquiring
the
petroleum
assets
of
his
country
,
as
compensation
for
the
costs
of
removing
him
from
power
.
Unfortunately
,
our
partners
from
1991
are
not
willing
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
this
new
venture
,
which
in
its
upcoming
phase
may
cost
the
sum
of
100
billion
to
200
billion
dollars
(
$
100,000,000,000
-
$
200,000,000,000
)
,
both
in
the
initial
acquisition
and
in
long
-
term
management
.
Without
the
funds
from
our
1991
partners
,
we
would
not
be
able
to
acquire
the
oil
revenue
trapped
within
Iraq
.
That
is
why
my
family
and
our
colleagues
are
urgently
seeking
your
gracious
assistance
.
Our
distinguished
colleagues
in
this
business
transaction
include
the
sitting
vice-president
of
the
United
States
of
America
,
Richard
Cheney
,
who
is
an
original
partner
in
the
Iraq
venture
and
former
head
of
the
Halliburton
oil
company
,
and
Condoleeza
Rice
,
whose
professional
dedication
to
the
venture
was
demonstrated
in
the
naming
of
a
Chevron
oil
tanker
after
her
.
I
would
beseech
you
to
transfer
a
sum
equaling
ten
to
twenty
-
five
percent
(
10
-
25
%
)
of
your
yearly
income
to
our
account
to
aid
in
this
important
venture
.
The
Internal
Revenue
Service
of
the
United
States
of
America
will
function
as
our
trusted
intermediary
.
I
propose
that
you
make
this
transfer
before
the
fifteenth
(
15th
)
of
the
month
of
April
.
I
know
that
a
transaction
of
this
magnitude
would
make
anyone
apprehensive
and
worried
.
But
I
am
assuring
you
that
all
will
be
well
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
A
bold
step
taken
shall
not
be
regretted
,
I
assure
you
.
Please
do
be
informed
that
this
business
transaction
is
100
%
legal
.
If
you
do
not
wish
to
co-operate
in
this
transaction
,
please
contact
our
intermediary
representatives
to
further
discuss
the
matter
.
I
pray
that
you
understand
our
plight
.
My
family
and
our
colleagues
will
be
forever
grateful
.
Please

in
strict
confidence
to

Emergency

are
battling

reach
survivors
of
Hurricane
Katrina
,
the
most
destructive
storm
to
hit
the

Hundreds

people
are

The

retrieve
the
dead

They

Excellent
answer
googlenut
.
Let
me
add
some
additional
info
.
You
can
get
details
about
NASA
spending
here
,
from
their
own
webpage
.
Also
,
from
their
own
webpage
,
reasons
why
NASA
is
important
,
in
a
5th
grade
format
.
I
guess
if
you
are
someone
not
familiar
with
how
NASA
benefits
our
society
I
can
see
how
one
might
form
the
opinion
of
yheggy
-
ga
.
Let
me
put
it
this
way
-
If
you
have
watched
TV
recently
,
crossed
a
modern
bridge
,
flown
in
an
airplane
,
recieved
any
form
of
modern
medicine
,
did
any
mathematics
,
drove
a
car
,
used
a
cellular
phone
,
etc.
then
you
have
somehow
directly
reaped
the
rewards
which
NASA
has
returned
to
us
.
Also
NASA
has
a
large
outreach
program
for
education
,
some
people
believe
this
is
important
.

i
believe
that
NASA
is
a
HUGE
waste
of
tax
payers
'
money
,
but
there
are
so
many
huge
wastes
of
tax
payer
monies
,
that
i
find
it
best
not
to
think
about
it
.
i
also
think
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
is
a
waste
,
but
i
guess
i
would
rather
see
my
money
go
to
the
NEA
than
NASA
.
of
course
,
in
a
perfect
world
,
tax
payers
'
money
would
go
toward
some
sort
of
national
healthcare
program
,
and
housing
for
the
homeless
,
but
this
is
far
from
a
perfect
world
.
in
response
to
Steve
's
comment
:
do
you
really
believe
that
spending
trillions
on
space
exploration
over
the
years
was
the
ONLY
way
to
invent
the
cellfone
?
and
bridges
???
i
find
that
extremely
hard
to
believe

i
think
it
could
have
been
done
in

much
more

efficient
way
,
right
here
on

Abby

twice
a

for
these

She
does

without

her
prognosis
is
grim

I

Benefit

By

(

China
's
insatiable
demand
for
energy
is
prompting
fears
of
financial
and
diplomatic
collisions
around
the
globe
as
it
seeks
reliable
supplies
of
oil
from
as
far
away
as
Brazil
and
Sudan
.
An
intrusion
into
Japanese
territorial
waters
by
a
Chinese
nuclear
submarine
last
week
and
a
trade
deal
with
Brazil
are
the
latest
apparently
unconnected
consequences
of
China
's
soaring
economic
growth
.
Increased
car
usage
in
China
is
creating
a
high
demand
for
petrol
The
connection
,
however
,
lies
in
an
order
issued
last
year
by
President
Hu
Jintao
to
seek
secure
oil
supplies
abroad
-
preferably
ones
which
could
not
be
stopped
by
America
in
case
of
conflict
over
Taiwan
.
The
submarine
incident
was
put
down
to
a
"
technical
error
"
by
the
Chinese
government
,
which
apologised
to
Japan
.
But
even
before
the
incident
the
People
's
Daily
,
the
government
mouthpiece
,
had
commented
that
competition
over
the
East
China
Sea
between
the
two
countries
was
"
only
a
prelude
of
the
game
between
China
and
Japan
in
the
arena
of
international
energy
"
.
The
Brazil
trade
deal
included
funding
for
a
joint
oil
-
drilling
and
pipeline
programme
at
a
cost
that
experts
said
would
add
up
to
three
times
the
cost
of
simply
buying
oil
on
the
market
.
The
West
,
however
,
has
paid
little
attention
to
these
developments
.
For
the
United
States
and
Europe
are
far
more
concerned
with
the
even
more
sensitive
issues
of
China
's
relations
with
"
pariah
states
"
.
In
September
,
China
threatened
to
veto
any
move
to
impose
sanctions
on
Sudan
over
the
atrocities
in
Darfur
.
It
has
invested
$
3
billion
in
the
African
country
's
oil
industry
,
which
supplies
it
with
seven
per
cent
of
its
needs
.
Then
,
this
month
,
it
said
that
it
opposed
moves
to
refer
Iran
's
nuclear
stand
-
off
with
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
to
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
.
A
week
before
,
China
's
second
biggest
state
oil
firm
had
signed
a
$
70
billion
deal
for
oilfield
and
natural
gas
development
with
Iran
,
which
already
supplies
13
per
cent
of
China
's
needs
.
China
has
its
own
reserves
of
oil
and
natural
gas
and
once
was
a
net
oil
exporter
.
But
as
its
economy
has
expanded
by
an
average
of
nine
per
cent
per
year
for
the
last
two
decades
,
so
has
its
demand
for
energy
.
This
year
it
overtook
Japan
as
the
world
's
second
largest
consumer
of
energy
,
behind
the
US
.
Its
projected
demand
,
boosted
by
a
huge
rise
in
car
ownership
as
well
as
the
need
to
find
alternatives
to
polluting
coal
for
electricity
generation
,
has
contributed
to
the
surge
in
the
price
of
oil
this
year
.
Shortages
are
already
leading
to
power
cuts
in
the
big
cities
.
Since
President
Hu
ordered
state
-
owned
oil
firms
to
"
go
abroad
"
to
ensure
supply
,
they
have
begun
drilling
for
gas
in
the
East
China
Sea
,
just
west
of
the
line
that
Japan
regards
as
its
border
.
Japan
protested
,
to
no
avail
,
that
the
project
should
be
a
joint
one
.
The
two
are
also
set
to
clash
over
Russia
's
oil
wealth
.
China
is
furious
that
Japan
has
outbid
it
in
their
battle
to
determine
the
route
of
the
pipeline
that
Russia
intends
to
build
to
the
Far
East
.
Japan
favoured
a
route
to
the
sea
,
enabling
oil
to
be
shipped
to
both
Japan
and
China
.
China
wanted
an
overland
route
through
its
own
territory
,
which
would
give
it
ultimate
control
if
hostilities
broke
out
.
Increasingly
,
analysts
are
saying
that
China
's
efforts
have
gone
beyond
what
is
safe
or
even
in
its
own
interests
.
Claude
Mandil
,
the
executive
director
of
the
International
Energy
Agency
in
Paris
,
said
the
reserves
in
the
East
China
Sea
were
hardly
worth
the
trouble
.
Nobody
thinks
that
there
will
be
a
lot
of
oil
and
gas
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
he
said
.
It
may
be
a
difficult
political
issue
but
I
do
n't
think
the
energy
content
is
worthwhile
.
Eurasia
Group
,
a
New
York
-
based
firm
of
political
analysts
,
said
its
oil
experts
worked
out
that
China
was
paying
such
an
inflated
price
for
its
investment
in
Brazil
that
the
cost
for
the
oil
it
ended
up
with
was
three
times
the
market
price
.
If
China
's
economy
falters
,
which
,
in
my
view
,
appears
increasingly
likely
,
then
commodity
prices
will
plummet
,
and
with
them
,
the
value
of
the
assets
that
produce
them
,
Jason
Kindopp
,
Eurasia
's
lead
China
analyst
,
said
.
Beijing
may
end
up
in
a
early
1990s
Japan
situation
,
where
it
is
forced
to
sell
recently
purchased
overseas
assets
for
a
fraction
of
what
it
paid
for
them
.
China
's
wider
aggression
to
secure
oil
and
gas
was
the
greatest
threat
to
its
international
standing
in
the
next
decade
.
Sudan
is
the
primary
example
,
he
said
.
It
marks
the
first
time
in
recent
years
that
China
has
promised
to
wield
its
veto
power
in
the
UN
Security
Council
against
a
petition
initiated
by
the
United
States
and
backed
by
France
and
Great
Britain
.

Visualizations
as
a
helpful
beginning
technique
-----------------------------------------------
If
you
consider
that
you
still
need
the
assistance
of
other
visualizations
to
help
the
mind
feel
the
spirit
of
transcendence
,
try
the
following
before
moving
onto
the
more
formal
method
below
.
Visualisations
can
be
as
useful
tools
,
but
meditation
is
more
than
that
.
Meditation
has
to
do
with
what
is
called
ideation
.
It
is
always
good
to
stick
to
a
formal
intense
meditation
practice
like
the
one
for
beginners
described
in
the
MP3
file
that
follows
after
the
visualisations
.
Find
a
comfortable
place
on
the
floor
and
sit
with
your
legs
crossed
.
Place
your
hands
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
your
lap
,
keep
your
back
straight
,
eyes
closed
and
tongue
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
.
Your
breathing
should
be
calm
and
relaxed
,
through
the
nose
.
Spend
a
minute
or
so
concentrating
on
your
breath
,
feeling
the
air
flowing
through
your
nostrils
.
1
.
Warm
Sun
Visualization
Continue
to
breathe
slowly
and
deeply
.
With
each
breath
,
feel
the
muscles
in
your
body
becoming
lighter
and
lighter
,
and
also
your
external
motor
and
sensory
organs
are
feeling
like
they
are
withdrawing
from
the
world
into
a
special
inner
quietness
.
Imagine
the
tension
melting
away
as
you
continue
breathing
rhythmically
and
naturally
.
Picture
yourself
sitting
on
a
warm
,
tropical
beach
basking
in
the
glow
of
the
sun
...
.
Visualize
the
vivid
,
beautiful
colours
of
the
earth
(
its
flowers
and
plants
)
,
the
sea
next
to
you
,
and
the
sky
above
you
.
Feel
yourself
floating
above
the
earth
and
sea
.
As
you
sit
above
the
world
,
the
warmth
of
the
golden
sun
penetrates
your
body
and
makes
you
feel
warmer
and
warmer
.
It
surrounds
you
.
The
golden
rays
feel
soft
and
soothing
.
Now
you
are
far
above
the
earth
-
into
space
.
Everything
around
you
is
so
vast
.
Yet
,
there
is
warmth
and
a
familiarity
with
the
vastness
.
You
want
to
merge
your
mind
with
the
greater
universal
Mind
that
surrounds
you
.
Continue
to
ideate
on
this
intense
desire
for
your
mind
to
merge
with
the
that
universal
Consciousness
.
And
while
doing
so
continue
using
the
Baba
Nam
Kevalam
mantra
(
breathe
in
with
Baba
Nam
,
breathe
out
with
Kevalam
)
.
Try
this
for
5
to
10
minutes
.
Now
come
back
to
earth
again
-
slowly
.
Imagine
yourself
sitting
on
the
beach
serenely
and
restfully
.
Your
muscles
are
loose
and
limp
.
Feel
your
body
sinking
slightly
into
the
sand
making
that
earthly
connection
again
.
The
sun
's
rays
and
warmth
are
still
with
you
,
surrounding
you
.
You
are
in
a
state
of
peace
and
relaxation
.
With
each
breath
,
watch
your
body
and
ensure
that
it
remains
relaxed
-
at
peace
.
Continue
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sunlight
all
over
your
body
,
warming
you
deeply
and
gently
.
You
want
to
bring
something
back
with
you
from
your
deep
space
experience
where
you
sensed
your
mind
merging
with
the
universal
Mind
.
This
will
be
the
warmth
of
the
sun
-
a
close
reminder
and
link
between
earth
and
the
infinite
space
.
Visualize
the
inside
of
your
body
bathed
in
the
golden
light
,
absorbing
every
ray
and
glowing
as
radiantly
as
the
sun
.
A
warm
,
gentle
breeze
swirls
around
your
body
and
relaxes
you
even
more
.
Let
your
mind
and
body
be
totally
at
peace
.
Now
feel
yourself
returning
to
where
you
sit
...
move
your
hands
and
feet
a
little
,
stretch
them
.
Open
your
eyes
.
2
.
Mountain
Visualization
Another
thing
you
can
try
.
Imagine
you
're
sitting
on
top
of
a
mountain
,
and
that
it
's
the
most
peaceful
place
you
can
think
of
.
Feel
that
you
're
sitting
there
in
complete
peace
,
right
on
top
of
the
world
.
Now
imagine
that
infinite
happiness
is
surrounding
you
in
every
direction
.
Feel
you
're
completely
surrounded
by
that
infinite
peace
and
happiness
.
Now
start
to
repeat
within
your
mind
the
mantra
:
BABA
NAM
KEVALAM
.
Its
meaning
is
"
Infinite
happiness
is
everywhere
"
.
Feel
the
meaning
,
do
n't
just
think
of
its
wordy
meaning
or
try
to
translate
from
Sanskrit
(
BABA
NAM
KEVALAM
)
to
an
English
meaning
(
Infinite
peace
and
happiness
)
.
Think
internally
,
intuitively
,
not
by
words
,
of
the
meaning
,
as
you
're
repeating
it
.
This
is
called
ideation
.
It
is
important
to
take
the
idea
,
not
just
the
intellectual
analysis
.
Touching
deep
into
the
idea
is
what
builds
intuition
-
it
is
a
synthetic
process
.
Whereas
,
trying
to
translate
and
grapple
with
wordy
meanings
is
an
intellectual
mechanism
-
an
analytical
process
.
Feel
you
're
surrounded
by
infinite
peace
and
happiness
,
and
feel
that
your
own
sense
of
existence
is
in
direct
contact
with
that
endless
peace
and
happiness
all
around
you
.
You
can
go
further
and
feel
that
your
unit
consciousness
,
a
dot
in
the
Infinite
Consciousness
,
is
merging
with
Infinity
.
Continue
for
as
long
as
you
like
,
then
open
your
eyes
.
OK
that
is
fairly
basic
:)
.
The
important
point
is
to
develop
some
psycho-spiritual
connection
between
your
mind
and
the
universal
Consciousness
or
Supreme
Consciousness
.
Do
n't
worry
if
you
have
trouble
concentrating
on
the
mantra
and
ideation
-
that
's
normal
.
It
takes
some
time
and
practice
to
be
able
to
focus
on
the
one
thought
.
The
main
thing
is
to
keep
practicing
.
If
you
do
n't
practice
,
then
nothing
happens
.
Well
maybe
a
miracle
could
happen
,
but
let
s
face
it
we
're
ordinary
people
and
so
require
practical
day
to
day
techniques
!

NORTH
CAROLINA
RELIGIOUS
COALITION
FOR
MARRIAGE
EQUALITY
From
what
we
hear
from
the
news
media
,
one
could
easily
conclude
that
all
Christians
are
opposed
to
gay
marriage
.
But
that
’s
not
the
case
.
Last
year
an
organization
named
the
North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
was
formed
to
get
out
the
message
that
at
least
some
people
of
faith
are
not
opposed
to
extending
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
civil
marriage
to
same
-
gender
couples
.
One
of
“
NCRC4ME
’s
”
major
efforts
is
to
collect
signatures
for
the
attached
“
Declaration
of
Religious
Leaders
,
”
which
has
been
and
will
again
be
presented
to
members
of
the
NC
legislature
.
It
presents
the
case
for
marriage
equality
and
states
,
“
We
are
resolved
that
the
State
should
not
interfere
with
same
-
gender
couples
who
choose
to
marry
and
share
fully
and
equally
in
the
rights
,
responsibilities
,
and
commitments
of
civil
marriage
.
”
A
measure
to
amend
the
NC
Constitution
to
ban
gay
marriage
was
defeated
last
year
but
already
has
been
reintroduced
in
the
2005
legislative
session
,
so
there
is
a
real
need
for
visible
support
for
the
“
pro-same
-
gender
-
marriage
”
side
of
this
issue
.
At
its
February
meeting
the
CHS
Vestry
voted
unanimously
to
add
their
names
to
the
Declaration
.
Our
Rector
Barbara
and
our
Deacon
Clare
also
have
signed
the
Declaration
.
Furthermore
,
the
Vestry
voted
unanimously
to
invite
the
support
of
members
of
the
CHS
congregation
for
the
Declaration
.
(
Since
the
Declaration
is
written
as
coming
from
“
religious
leaders
,
”
people
who
do
n’t
consider
themselves
“
religious
leaders
”
can
sign
as
“
Supporters
of
the
North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
.
”
)
Please
note
that
the
Declaration
addresses
only
civil
marriage
;
it
says
nothing
about
religious
beliefs
or
practices
regarding
marriage
.
If
you
have
any
questions
please
feel
free
to
call
me
(
after
Sat.
the
26th
,
when
I
will
return
from
a
trip
)
.
Sign
-
up
lists
will
be
available
at
the
services
on
Feb.
27
and
March
6
,
or
you
can
email
me
.
I
will
email
names
and
email
addresses
(
or
postal
addresses
)
of
signers
to
NCRC4ME
in
time
for
their
“
lobby
day
”
in
Raleigh
on
March
15
.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
issue

North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
Declaration
of
Religious
Leaders
April
19
,
2004
The
most
fundamental
human
right
,
after
the
necessities
of
food
,
clothing
and
shelter
,
is
the
right
to
affection
and
the
supportive
love
of
other
human
beings
.
We
become
most
fully
human
when
we
love
another
person
.
We
can
grow
in
our
capacity
to
be
human
-
to
be
loving
-
in
a
family
unit
.
This
right
to
love
and
form
a
family
is
so
fundamental
that
our
United
States
Constitution
takes
it
for
granted
in
its
dedication
to
"
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
.
”
The
North
Carolina
Constitution
likewise
affirms
the
“
inalienable
rights
”
of
human
beings
to
"
life
,
liberty
,
the
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
their
own
labor
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.
"
Throughout
history
,
tyrants
have
known
that
by
denying
the
right
of
oppressed
peoples
to
form
and
nurture
families
,
they
can
kill
the
spirit
of
those
peoples
.
>
From
the
shameful
history
of
slavery
in
America
,
the
injustice
of
forbidding
people
to
marry
is
evident
as
a
denial
of
a
basic
human
right
.
The
American
laws
forbidding
interracial
marriage
,
now
struck
down
,
were
clearly
discriminatory
.
Denial
of
the
status
of
marriage
to
those
who
would
freely
accept
its
responsibilities
creates
legal
and
economic
inequities
and
social
injustice
.
We
feel
called
to
protest
and
oppose
this
injustice
.
As
religious
people
,
clergy
and
lay
leaders
,
we
are
mandated
by
faith
to
stand
for
justice
in
our
common
civic
life
.
We
oppose
the
use
of
sacred
texts
and
religious
traditions
to
deny
legal
equity
to
same
-
gender
couples
.
As
concerned
citizens
we
affirm
the
liberty
of
adults
of
the
same
gender
to
love
and
marry
.
We
insist
that
no
one
,
especially
the
state
,
is
allowed
to
coerce
people
into
marriage
or
bar
two
consenting
adults
,
whether
of
the
same
or
differing
genders
,
from
forming
the
family
unit
that
lets
them
be
more
fully
loving
,
thus
more
fully
human
.
We
respect
the
fact
that
debate
and
discussion
continue
in
many
of
our
religious
communities
as
to
the
scriptural
,
theological
and
liturgical
issues
involved
.
However
,
we
draw
on
our
many
faith
traditions
to
arrive
at
a
common
conviction
.
We
are
resolved
that
the
State
should
not
interfere
with
same
-
gender
couples
who
choose
to
marry
and
share
fully
and
equally
in
the
rights
,
responsibilities
,
and
commitments
of
civil
marriage
.
We
affirm
freedom
of
conscience
in
this
matter
.
We
recognize
that
the
state
may
not
require
religious
groups
to
officiate
at
,
or
bless
,
same
-
gender
marriages
.
Likewise
,
a
denial
of
state
civil
recognition
dishonors
the
religious
convictions
of
those
communities
and
clergy
who
officiate
at
,
and
bless
,
same
-
gender
marriages
.
The
state
may
not
favor
the
convictions
of
one
religious
group
over
another
by
denying
individuals
their
fundamental
right
to
marry
and
to
have
those
marriages
recognized
by
civil
law
.
As
faith
leaders
,
we
commit
ourselves
to
public
action
,
visibility
,
education
,
and
mutual
support
in
the
service
of
the
right
and
freedom
to
marry
.

The
One
Reason
Why
All
Americans
Should
Oppose
The
Nomination
Of
Samuel
Alito
He
Would
Tear
Down
Our
System
Of
Checks
And
Balances
,
Giving
Far
Too
Much
Power
To
The
President
My
Fellow
Americans
:
As
many
of
you
may
have
heard
,
President
Bush
has
nominated
a
long
-
time
Federal
Judge
named
Samuel
Alito
to
become
the
next
member
of
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
,
to
fill
a
vacancy
created
by
the
retirement
of
another
member
of
the
Court
.
Under
our
Constitution
,
this
nomination
can
not
take
effect
unless
and
until
the
United
States
Senate
gives
its
Consent
,
as
described
in
our
Constitution
,
Article
II
,
Section
2
.

Judge
Samuel
Alito
is
very
highly
qualified
by
all
of
the
normal
standards
used
to
evaluate
candidates
for
this
position
:
He
has
a
very
high
intellect
.
He
graduated
very
high
in
his
class
,
from
Princeton
undergraduate
and
from
Law
School
at
Yale
.
He
has
a
long
and
distinguished
record
,
including
many
years
as
a
Federal
Appeals
Judge
,
the
next
level
below
Supreme
Court
.
He
has
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
hundreds
of
different
Supreme
Court
cases
,
and
he
can
recite
details
from
memory
.
He
demonstrates
an
excellent
"
Judicial
Temperament
,
"
being
courteous
,
mild
-
mannered
,
respectful
of
all
people
;
careful
in
his
work
,
meticulous
in
detail
.
His
co-workers
love
him
.
His
fellow
judges
love
him
.
His
family
loves
him
.
President
Bush
loves
him
.
Yes
,
it
is
true
that
some
people
do
n't
like
the
way
they
think
he
will
vote
on
the
Supreme
Court
.
But
other
people
do
like
the
way
they
think
he
will
vote
,
and
the
ones
who
favor
him
seem
to
outnumber
the
ones
who
oppose
him
.
So
now
the
Senate
is
getting
ready
to
vote
soon
,
on
whether
to
approve
him
or
not
;
and
at
this
moment
(
evening
of
Jan.
27
,
2006
)
it
looks
like
he
has
more
than
the
fifty
-
one
votes
needed
for
approval
.
The
President
is
very
eager
to
go
ahead
quickly
and
get
this
vote
,
because
he
very
much
wants
to
have
Samuel
Alito
on
the
Supreme
Court
,
to
be
judging
the
cases
Bush
is
interested
in
.
So
there
is
a
lot
of
hurry
-
up
pressure
on
the
Senate
to
give
its
prompt
vote
of
approval
.
There
is
an
old
saying
that
applies
in
this
situation
:
"
Act
in
haste
,
repent
at
leisure
.
"
Sometimes
you
can
make
a
bad
decision
very
quickly
,
then
regret
it
for
many
years
to
come
.
That
is
what
is
about
to
happen
with
Judge
Samuel
Alito
,
in
my
opinion
,
because
he
has
one
tragic
flaw
-
a
very
serious
blind
spot
in
his
thinking
-
which
makes
him
completely
unacceptable
for
the
position
of
Supreme
Court
Justice
:
He
does
not
really
agree
with
the
system
of
"
Checks
and
Balances
"
built
into
the
Constitution
,
and
he
is
ready
to
start
tearing
it
down
in
order
to
follow
the
"
Unitary
Executive
Theory
,
"
which
calls
for
vastly
-
increased
Presidential
Power
at
the
expense
of
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
.
And
because
of
this
tragic
flaw
.
.
.
He
Would
Tear
Down
Our
System
Of
Checks
And
Balances
,
Giving
Far
Too
Much
Power
To
The
President
.
In
our
Constitutional
system
,
we
have
three
branches
of
the
Federal
Government
:
the
Legislative
,
Executive
,
and
Judicial
branches
.
And
the
basic
idea
behind
the
Checks
and
Balances
we
have
is
that
if
one
branch
of
the
Government
goes
crazy
,
the
other
two
can
hold
it
down
.
But
Samuel
Alito
believes
in
a
little
-
known
Constitutional
theory
-
called
the
"
Unitary
Executive
Theory
"
-
which
says
that
the
President
should
have
complete
control
over
the
Executive
Branch
,
and
that
the
Executive
Branch
should
be
in
charge
of
almost
everything
that
the
Government
actually
does
,
including
the
functions
of
the
Independent
Agencies
which
were
designed
to
be
free
of
Presidential
control
,
and
the
Military
,
which
exists
,
which
is
regulated
,
and
which
is
funded
by
specific
authority
given
by
the
Constitution
to
Congress
,
not
to
the
President
.
The
Military
is
not
part
of
the
Executive
Branch
:
it
is
a
separate
entity
.
Commander
In
Chief
does
n't
mean
that
he
is
the
boss
of
the
Military
,
merely
that
he
is
the
Administrator
,
just
as
he
is
the
Administrator
of
the
Executive
Branch
,
charged
with
"
executing
faithfully
"
all
the
laws
passed
by
Congress
and
all
the
Decisions
rendered
by
the
Supreme
Court
.
Under
the
Unitary
Executive
Theory
,
the
Laws
of
Congress
and
Decisions
of
the
Supreme
Court
have
no
actual
authority
unless
the
President
agrees
with
them
.
And
so
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
become
mere
advisors
to
the
President
,
with
no
real
authority
over
him
.
And
the
President
becomes
a
Dictator
,
unrestrained
by
anything
in
the
Constitution
,
backed
up
by
the
Armed
Forces
,
which
would
be
entirely
under
his
personal
control
.
And
thus
the
United
States
of
America
-
The
Land
Of
The
Free
And
The
Home
Of
The
Brave
-
becomes
just
another
Military
Dictatorship
,
no
better
than
Nazi
Germany
or
Fascist
Italy
during
World
War
II
.
AND
THAT
IS
WHY
ALL
AMERICANS
SHOULD
OPPOSE
THE
NOMINATION
OF
SAMUEL
ALITO
.

Trying

Some
strategies
being
used
by
NASA

in
relation
to
China
and
other
space
planning
countries
are
mentioned
here
after
being
gleaned
from
a

underneath
.
Country

an
Independent

to

"
Numero
Uno
"
strategy
,
try
to
assert
,
beat
,
mesh
and
control
the
space
program
of
the
country
.
This
can
also
be
through
political
,
economical
,
social
,
and
technological
influence
.
Country

or
not

"
strategy
especially
when
the
country
has
a

ambitious

program
.
This
can

Dependant

NASA

to

This
is
really
an
end
goal
aim
of
NASA

and
also
does
not

The

probably
to
get
by
2018
all
the
ambitious

countries
shifting
towards
this

Secretive

's

China
launched
Shenzhou
VI
,
its
second
manned
spacecraft
,
early
today
in
northwest
China
's
Gansu
Province
.
A
pair
of
military
pilots
embarked
on
China
's
second
manned
space
flight
early
today
,
hurtling
into
orbit
on
a
test
mission
that
could
span
five
days
.
The
crew
of
the
Shenzhou
VI
spacecraft
was
identified
as
Fei
Junlong
,
40
,
and
Nie
Haishen
,
41
,
by
China
's
official
news
agency
.
The
successful
launch
from
the
Jiuquan
Satellite
Launch
Center
in
northwest
China
follows
the
solo
flight
of
Yang
Liwei
in
October
2003
.
His
one
-
day
mission
vaulted
his
communist
homeland
into
the
elite
circle
of
spacefaring
nations
-
Russia
and
the
United
States
-
that
can
launch
and
sustain
humans
in
space
.
Most
experts
believe
China
intends
to
develop
a
small
space
station
of
its
own
over
the
next
several
years
.
But
they
remain
uncertain
about
whether
China
aims
to
beat
the
United
States
to
the
moon
in
its
secretive
space
effort
.
President
Bush
has
directed
NASA
to
return
to
the
moon
by
2018
with
a
new
generation
of
human
explorers
.
China
's
"
is
not
a
fly
-
by
-
night
program
,
"
said
Joan
Johnson
-
Freese
,
an
expert
on
national
security
who
follows
space
developments
in
the
Asian
nation
at
the
Naval
War
College
in
Newport
,
R.I
.
They
want
a
program
that
will
be
a
success
,
"
Johnson
-
Freese
said
.
Economics
will
be
a
big
determiner
in
the
speed
of
their
program
.
"
China
's
overtures
to
join
the
U.S.
-
led
effort
to
develop
the
16
-
nation
international
space
station
have
been
thwarted
for
more
than
a
decade
over
a
range
of
issues
,
including
the
Asian
country
's
human
rights
policies
and
worries
it
could
acquire
technologies
that
could
pose
a
security
threat
.
The
freeze
thawed
some
after
Yang
's
2003
mission
.
China
was
among
30
nations
invited
to
send
a
delegate
to
NASA
-
sponsored
roundtable
discussions
on
Bush
's
strategy
to
reach
the
moon
with
astronauts
as
the
first
step
in
the
exploration
of
Mars
and
other
-
deep
space
destinations
.
We
applaud
China
's
space
achievements
,
NASA
spokesman
Allard
Beutel
said
Tuesday
.
We
wish
them
a
successful
return
of
their
astronauts
.
He
stressed
,
however
,
that
NASA
would
not
follow
this
week
's
Chinese
mission
through
formal
channels
.
At
present
,
there
are
no
plans
for
additional
meetings
with
foreign
powers
to
discuss
the
Bush
exploration
initiative
or
to
extend
an
invitation
to
China
to
join
the
space
station
partnership
,
Beutel
said
.
The
flight
of
Fei
and
Nie
could
mark
the
end
of
the
opening
chapter
in
a
three
-
phase
Chinese
space
initiative
,
Johnson
-
Freese
said
.
The
first
phase
,
she
said
,
will
demonstrate
the
capability
of
a
multi-compartment
spacecraft
that
will
leave
a
test
module
in
orbit
when
the
two
fliers
return
to
Earth
.
The
Chinese
program
's
second
phase
will
include
spacewalks
on
future
missions
and
demonstrations
of
docking
and
undocking
techniques
.
The
final
phase
will
feature
the
assembly
and
operation
of
a
longer
-
duration
space
lab
.
At
least
one
expert
believes
China
's
intentions
might
include
a
surprise
attempt
to
circle
the
moon
with
astronauts
before
NASA
's
planned
lunar
return
.
The
Americans
would
be
wise
to
plan
accordingly
,
said
John
E.
Pike
,
director
of
the
Alexandria
,
Va.
-
based
GlobalSecurity.org
,
a
small
national
security
think
tank
.
There
is
always
the
possibility
they
could
jam
us
up
,
make
us
look
like
we
are
not
numero
uno
,
Pike
said
.
During
the
U.S.
and
Russian
lunar
race
during
the
Cold
War
,
NASA
scored
an
early
coup
by
circling
the
moon
with
the
Apollo
8
crew
over
the
1968
Christmas
holidays
.
As
it
turned
out
,
the
Soviets
never
made
it
to
the
moon
.
(
China
)
could
be
the
second
country
to
do
that
,
Pike
said
.
And
they
would
not
have
to
land
on
the
moon
to
take
us
down
a
notch
.
"
Pike
's
concern
is
based
on
China
's
development
of
a
new
medium
-
lift
rocket
,
the
Long
March
V
,
and
the
construction
of
a
new
space
launch
complex
on
Hainan
Island
in
the
South
China
Sea
.
The
two
developments
,
he
said
,
could
eventually
enable
China
's
space
program
to
mature
to
the
point
that
experts
could
assemble
and
launch
from
Earth
's
orbit
a
spacecraft
capable
of
circling
the
moon
with
astronauts
and
returning
home
.

I
'm
a

rights
news
,
and
get
regular
emails
from
other
members
and
the
staff
.
Recently
,
I
read
an
email
that
reported
the
horrific
nightmare
Civet
Cats
go
through
by
sick
losers
who
put
them
in
sheds
and
heat
the
inside
of
the
sheds
up
to
110
degrees
with
fires
,
so
that
they
can
periodically
scrape
the
sweat
off
of
their
genitals
and
sell
it
to
corrupt
corporations
who
use
it
to
prolong
the
scent
of
perfumes
.
The
animals
eventually
die
,
which
is
because
these
demons
are
so
GREEDY
,
they
want
as
much
of
their
"
product
"
as
they
can
get
,
instead
of
letting
the
cats
go
after
a
point
,
as
an
act
of
humanity
,
mercy
,
love
.
Below
I
pasted
the
email
text
,
and
it
has
a
link
to
a
website
that
automatically
plays
this
song
the
author
of
the
email
created
.
It
has
cat
's
"
Meowing
"
for
the
vocals
,
and
you
might
really
find
yourself
in
those
furnaces
,
feeling
and
thinking
those
terrible
feelings
and
thoughts
that
these
cats
do
before
they
die
.
Right
now
,
while
we
're
sitting
at
our
computers
enjoying
the
internet
,
those
innocent
,
beautiful
,
loving
cats
,
are
dying
,
somewhere
in
this
troubled
world
a
slow
,
agonizing
death
.
The
main
reason
I
wrote
this
post
is
to
ask
anyone
reading
this
if
they
know
of
some
way
I
can
help
put
a
stop
to
this
Cat
Holocaust
.
I
am
serious
about
doing
something
.
If
I
love
cats
so
much
,
why
are
n't
I
DOING
something
???
I
do
n't
want
to
appear
before
God
on
judgment
day
and
have
to
explain
why
I
did
n't
do
anything
like
this
in
my
life
.
Any
suggestions
would
be
appreciated
.
Here
's
the
text
of
the
email
:
Hi
there
,
I
read
the
Civet
Cat
story
from
a
little
while
ago
,
and
tonight
,
when
my
Mom
emailed
me
about
it
,
I
re-read
it
,
and
went
to
the
website
with
the
song
the
author
of
the
email
created
.
Well
,
sure
enough
,
when
I
heard
the
cats
"
Meowing
,
"
I
imagined
the
hellish
moments
these
poor
beautiful
creatures
of
God
were
living
,
what
went
on
in
their
tiny
,
sweet
little
minds
,
and
decided
that
I
want
to
do
something
about
this
torture
.
So
,
if
anyone
can
give
me
some
advice
,
I
'd
sure
appreciate
it
!
I
think
for
starters
,
myself
and
those
of
you
who
believe
in
God
could
say
a
special
prayer
for
them
.
I
will
.
I
've
pasted
the
email
for
those
who
have
n't
seen
or
would
like
to
re-read
it
.
It
's
also
got
the
website
where
the
song
has
been
uploaded
.
I
was
thinking
,
that
while
I
'm
sitting
here
,
relaxing
and
enjoying
myself
,
those
poor
innocent
animals
are
being
cooked
to
death
with
heat
in
those
Holocaust-esque
death
chambers
.
And
what
am
I
DOING
about
it
?

Civet

,
James
Rachels
+
a
song
This
is
my
first
time
posting
to
the
list
,
so
I
feel
somewhat
embarrassed
by
"
promoting
"
a
song
I
wrote
,
but
I
think
it
is
fitting
because
it
is
directly
tied
to
extreme
animal
suffering
as
a
result
of
human
lack
of
empathy
,
but
an
abundance
of
human
greed
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
any
of
you
know
much
about
civet
cats
,
but
to
brief
those
who
might
not
know
,
I
will
quote
James
Rachels
,
author
of
World
Hunger
and
Moral
Obligation
among
many
other
animal
rights
-
related
books
and
articles
.
(
I
kind
of
see
him
to
be
for
animal
rights
theory
as
Peter
Singer
is
to
the
theory
of
utilitarianism
applied
to
non-human
animals
)
.
The
quote
is
from
an
article
entitled
"
Vegetarianism
and
`
The
Other
Weight
Problem
'
"
If
anyone
wants
the
complete
article
,
email
me
,
as
it
is
a
very
good
article
which
no
meat
-
eater
can
read
and
not
sense
their
own
hypocrisy
.
But
this
is
what
he
says
about
civet
cats
:
Civet
cats
are
trapped
and
placed
in
small
cages
inside
darkened
sheds
,
where
the
temperature
is
kept
up
to
110
F
by
fires
.
They
are
confined
in
this
way
until
they
finally
die
.
What
justifies
this
extraordinary
mistreatment
?
These
animals
have
the
misfortune
to
produce
a
substance
that
is
useful
in
the
manufacture
of
perfume
.
Musk
,
which
is
scraped
from
their
genitals
once
a
day
for
as
long
as
they
can
surv
ive
,
makes
the
scent
of
perfume
last
a
bit
longer
after
each
application
.
(
The
heat
increases
their
"
production
"
of
musk
.
)
Here
Kant
's
rule
--
"
Animals
are
merely
means
to
an
end
;
that
end
is
man
"
--
is
applied
with
a
vengeance
.
To
promote
one
of
the
most
trivial
interests
we
have
,
thousands
of
animals
are
tormented
for
their
whole
lives
.
"
This
article
,
and
specifically
this
piece
,
effected
me
enough
to
try
to
build
a
song
around
the
topic
.
If
anyone
is
interested
in
listening
to
this
song
,
and
in
offering
their
opinion
,
whether
it
be
positive
or
negative
,
I
'd
appreciate
it
.
But
I
also
hope
no
one
feels
any
obligation
to
download
,
especially
if
you
have
an
internet
connection
as
slow
mine
(
28
k
)
.
The
url
for
the
song
is
http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/TragiCore-TheCivetCat.mp3
Although
there
are
no
human
vocals
/
lyrics
,
I
think
it's
subject
matter
is
audible
.
Again
,
if
anyone
wants
to
read
Rachels
'
entire
article
,
let
me
know
.
It
's
also
on
the
net
.
I
was
already
a
vegetarian
when
I
read
it
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
,
but
it
was
one
of
the
bigger
factors
for
me
in
going
completely
vegan
.
I
hope
all
are
well
.
Farewell
for
now

THIS
IS
NOT
A
SCAM
!!!
I
found
this
on
a
bulletin
board
and
decided
to
try
it
:
I
do
n't
care
about
the
useless
pre-fabricated
crap
this
message
usually
says
.
All
I
say
is
,
it
works
.
Continue
pre-fab
crap
.
WELL
GUESS
WHAT
!!!
Within
seven
days
,
I
started
getting
money
in
the
mail
!!
I
was
shocked
!!
I
figured
it
would
end
soon
,
but
the
money
just
kept
coming
in
.
In
my
first
week
,
I
made
about
$
25.00
.
By
the
end
of
the
second
week
I
had
made
a
total
of
more
than
$
1000.00
!!
In
the
third
week
I
had
more
than
$
10,000.00
and
it
's
still
growing
!!
This
is
now
my
fourth
week
and
I
have
made
a
total
of
$
42,000.00
and
it
's
still
coming
rapidly
.
It
's
certainly
worth
$
6.00
and
six
stamps
,
and
I
have
spent
more
than
that
on
the
lottery
without
ever
winning
!!!
Let
me
tell
you
how
this
works
and
most
important
,
why
it
works

need
it
.
I
promise
you
that
if
you
follow
the
directions
exactly
that
you

-
off
,
it
is
decent
;
it
's
legal
;
and
it
is
virtually
no

!!
If
all
the
following
instructions
are
adhered
to
,
you
will
receive
extraordinary
dividends
.
PLEASE
NOTE
:
Please
follow
the
directions
EXACTLY
,
and
$
50,000
or
more
can
be
yours
in
20
to
60
days
.
This
program
remains
successful
because
of
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
the
participants
.
Please
continue
its
success
by
carefully
adhering
to
the
instructions
.
You
will
now
become
a
part
of
the
Mail
Order
business
.
You
are
in
the
business
of
developing
Mailing
Lists
.
Many
large
corporations
are
happy
to
pay
big
bucks
for
quality
lists
.
However
,
the
money
made
from
the
mailing
lists
is
secondary
to
income
which
is
made
from
people
like
you
and
me
asking
to
be
included
in
that
list
.
Here
are
the
four
easy
steps
to
success
.
STEP
ONE
:
Get
six
separate
pieces
of
paper
and
write
the
following
on
each
piece
of
paper
"
PLEASE
PUT
ME
ON
YOUR
MAILING
LIST
.
"
Now
get
6
U.S.
$
1.00
bills
and
place
ONE
inside
of
EACH
of
the
six
pieces
of
paper
so
the
bill
will
not
be
seen
through
the
envelope
(
to
prevent
thievery
)
.
Next
,
place
one
paper
in
each
of
the
six
envelopes
and
seal
them
.
You
now
should
have
six
sealed
envelopes
,
each
with
a
piece
of
paper
stating
the
above
phrase
,
your
name
and
address
,
and
a
$
1.00
bill
.
What
you
are
doing
is
creating
a
service
.
THIS
IS
ABSOLUTELY
LEGAL
!!!!
!
You
are
requesting
a
legitimate
service
and
you
are
paying
for
it
!!
Like
most
of
us
I
was
a
little
skeptical
and
little
worried
about
the
legal
aspects
of
it
all
.
So
I
checked
it
out
with
the
U.S.
Post
Office
(
1-800-238-5355
)
and
they
confirmed
that
it
is
indeed
legal
!!
Mail
the
six
envelopes
to
the
following
addresses

STEP
TWO
:
Now
take
the
#
1
name
off
the
list
that
you
see
above
,
move
the
other
names
up
(
six
becomes
5
,
5
becomes
4
,
and
etc.
)
and
add
YOUR
NAME
as
number
6
on
the
list
.
STEP
THREE
:
Change
anything
you
need
to
but
try
to
keep
this
article
as
close
to
original
as
possible
.
Now
post
your
amended
article
to
at
least
200
news
groups
.
:
(
I
think
there
are
close
to
24,000
groups
)
All
you
need
is
200
,
but
remember
,
the
more
you
post
,
the
more
money
you
make
!!
This
is
perfectly
legal
!!
If
you
have
any
doubts
,
refer
to
Title
18
Sec.
1302
&
1341
of
the
Postal
Lottery
laws
.
Keep
a
copy
of
these
steps
for
yourself
and
whenever
you
need
money
,
you
can
use
it
again
,
and
again
.
PLEASE
REMEMBER
that
this
program
remains
successful
because
of
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
the
participants
and
by
their
carefully
adhering
to
directions
.
Look
at
it
this
way
.
If
you
were
of
integrity
,
the
program
will
continue
and
the
money
that
so
many
others
have
received
will
come
your
way
.
NOTE
:
You
may
want
to
retain
every
name
and
address
sent
to
you
,
either
on
a
computer
or
hard
copy
and
keep
the
notes
people
send
you
.
This
VERIFIES
that
you
are
truly
providing
a
service
.
(
Also
,
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
wrap
the
$
1
bill
in
dark
paper
to
reduce
the
risk
of
mail
theft
)
.
So
,
as
each
post
is
downloaded
and
the
directions
carefully
followed
,
all
members
will
be
reimbursed
for
their
participation
as
a
List
Developer
with
one
dollar
each
.
Your
name
will
move
up
the
list
geometrically
so
that
when
your
name
reaches
the
#
1
position
you
will
be
receiving
thousands
of
dollars
in
CASH
!!!
What
an
opportunity
for
only
$
6.00
(
$
1.00
for
each
of
the
first
six
people
listed
above
)
Send
it
now
,
add
your
own
name
to
the
list
and
you
're
in
business

Who
's
afraid
of
Big
Bad
Wolf
?
By
Dan
Whipple
UNITED
PRESS
INTERNATIONAL
Boulder
,
CO
,
Feb.
23
(
UPI
)
--
Ever
since
he
ate
up
Red
Riding
Hood
's
grandma
and
blew
down
the
houses
of
two
-
thirds
of
the
Three
Little
Pigs
,
the
Big
Bad
Wolf
has
held
a
persistently
bad
reputation
.
In
part
because
of
that
reputation
,
the
gray
wolf
was
nearly
exterminated
from
the
lower
48
states
by
the
1920s
,
except
for
a
small
remnant
population
on
Isle
Royale
National
Park
in
Michigan
's
Lake
Superior
.
The
last
wolf
was
killed
in
Yellowstone
National
Park
in
1943
.
Western
sheep
and
cattle
ranchers
,
on
whose
behalf
this
extermination
campaign
was
conducted
,
gratefully
dusted
their
hands
of
the
wolf
and
wrote
him
off
as
a
job
well
done
.
Their
sheep
could
graze
,
their
cows
could
ruminate
and
never
a
discouraging
word
would
be
heard
.
After
the
major
kill
-
offs
,
wolves
outside
of
Alaska
and
Canada
existed
mostly
as
legend
.
Like
UFOs
or
Sasquatch
,
several
people
claimed
to
see
fleeting
lone
wolves
,
usually
in
Yellowstone
.
In
the
1960s
,
a
group
shooting
a
movie
in
the
Wyoming
park
reportedly
imported
some
captive
wolves
,
then
released
them
when
their
shooting
was
done
.
If
so
,
this
happy
band
has
not
been
heard
from
since
.
Rumor
also
had
it
some
renegade
biologist
brought
a
caged
pair
to
Yellowstone
and
released
them
into
the
wild
sometime
in
the
1970s
,
hoping
to
reestablish
a
breeding
population
.
If
true
,
the
caper
failed
.
Over
time
,
the
wolf
's
absence
seemed
to
rehabilitate
its
image
.
Eventually
,
a
trickle
of
support
appeared
for
bringing
the
predator
back
to
its
former
home
range
in
the
northern
Rocky
Mountains
.
This
trickle
grew
into
a
flood
,
resulting
in
14
wolves
being
reintroduced
in
Yellowstone
in
1995
by
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
--
albeit
over
the
strong
and
still
-
continuing
objections
of
ranchers
.
These
wolf
packs
have
flourished
,
and
now
there
are
an
estimated
850
wolves
roaming
the
northern
Rockies
,
where
merely
10
years
ago
there
were
none
.
One
compelling
argument
for
reintroduction
was
the
wolf
acts
as
a
keystone
predator
,
an
animal
that
affects
the
populations
,
behavior
and
ecology
of
a
wide
variety
of
species
within
its
range
.
Some
recent
research
conducted
by
Oregon
State
University
has
given
considerable
credence
to
this
idea
.
OSU
forestry
professors
William
Ripple
and
Robert
Beschta
have
found
that
wolves
actually
promote
stream
-
bank
stabilization
,
although
they
have
given
the
phenomenon
the
unfortunate
name
of
"
the
ecology
of
fear
"
--
something
that
smacks
of
the
horrible
PR
resulting
from
the
wolf
's
relationships
with
Riding
Hood
and
the
Three
Pigs
.
They
explained
that
elk
in
Yellowstone
used
to
browse
unmolested
on
young
aspen
and
willow
growing
near
the
banks
of
streams
,
a
behavior
that
prevented
the
saplings
from
reaching
mature
stages
and
increased
the
possibility
of
soil
erosion
.
Since
reintroduction
,
however
,
Ripple
and
Beschta
have
found
,
fear
of
the
wolves
apparently
has
discouraged
the
elk
from
spending
too
much
time
at
stream
banks
--
where
they
are
out
in
the
open
--
and
munching
on
the
saplings
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
photographs
,
Ed
Bangs
,
wolf
recovery
coordinator
for
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
,
told
UPI
's
Blue
Planet
,
An
area
that
used
to
be
bald
as
a
billiard
ball
is
now
a
sea
of
willow
.
"
This
simple
change
has
triggered
a
veritable
ecological
cascade
in
Yellowstone
.
More
streamside
willow
and
aspen
have
meant
better
habitat
for
beaver
,
for
instance
.
Where
there
had
been
only
one
beaver
colony
in
the
park
's
northern
range
before
the
wolves
returned
,
now
there
are
nine
.
It
may
be
uninteresting
to
a
lot
of
people
,
Beschta
told
Blue
Planet
.
But
we
've
been
looking
at
streamside
communities
.
Since
wolf
recovery
,
streamside
plants
,
willows
and
cottonwoods
provide
food
for
other
critters
--
beavers
,
a
whole
variety
of
avian
species
,
berry
-

's

Yellowstone
has
a
vast
elk
herd
,
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
.
Bangs
said
although
the
number
of
elk
has
not
declined
very
much
since
the
wolves
came
back
,
their
behavior
appears
markedly
different
.
I
'm
pretty
suspicious
of
making
broad
generalizations
,
however
,
he
cautioned
.
They
've
only
been
there
for
10
years

In
10
more
years
we
'll
have
a
better
idea
.
"
Wolf
reintroduction
in
the
northern
Rockies
has
been
so
successful
the
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
has
moved
to
reduce
the
animal
's
status
from
endangered
to
threatened
and
,
eventually
,
to
remove
it
from
the
endangered
species
list
altogether
.
Bangs
said
the
agency
has
established
viable
wolf
packs
in
the
northern
Rockies
,
as
required
by
federal
regulations
.
Some
conservationists
want
the
protection
extended
so
wolves
can
move
into
other
states
,
including
Colorado
,
Utah
and
Oregon
,
among
others
.
On
Jan.
31
,
Oregon
Federal
District
Court
Judge
Robert
E.
Jones
appeared
to
agree
with
them
.
He
vacated
the
FWS
decision
to
downgrade
the
wolf
's
status
.
Bangs
said
his
agency
is
still
reviewing
the
decision
.
Regardless
of
the
wolf
's
legal
status
,
its
future
expansion
into
new
areas
now
seems
likely
.
Wolves
can
migrate
considerable
distances
.
A
Yellowstone
wolf
was
found
dead
,
hit
by
a
car
,
on
a
Colorado
highway
last
year
,
several
hundred
miles
from
home
.
Meanwhile
,
his
reputation
seems
to
be
improving
,
although
Bangs
noted
a
"
pretty
interesting
social
dynamic
.
"
There
are
only
about
850
wolves
in
the
West
,
but
there
are
an
estimated
31,000
mountain
lions
.
Pound
for
pound
,
mountain
lions
eat
more
game
and
more
livestock
than
wolves
.
They
even
occasionally
attack
people
,
which
wolves
do
not
--
despite
the
propaganda
from
the
Brothers
Grimm
.
Yet
people
seem
willing
--
even
eager
--
to
accommodate
mountain
lions
,
despite
the
risks
.
It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
they
will
extend
the
same
courtesy
to
the
arriving
gray
wolf
.
Regarding
those
rumors
about
wolves
living
in
Yellowstone
prior
to
the
official
reintroduction
?
They
seem
to
be
just
that
:
rumors
.
True
,
there
are
about
300,000
wolves
and
wolf
hybrids
kept
as
pets
in
the
United
States
.
It
also
is
likely
people
have
released
some
of
these
animals
into
the
wild
hoping
they
would
survive
--
for
instance
,
a
ranger
in
Glacier
Park
caught
someone
in
this
very
act
not
long
ago
.
Bangs
said
these
animals
are
not
equipped
to
survive
in
the
wild
,
however
,
and
they
all
almost
certainly
have
died
.
He
said
after
10
years
of
DNA
testing
on
northern
Rockies
wolves
,
scientists
have
not
found
a
single
strain
that
did
not
belong
to
one
of
the
wolves
the
agency
released
--
or
their
descendants
.

Humans
fuss

By

UNITED

Boulder

Nov.
15
(
UPI
)
--
Scientists
can
argue
all
they
want
about
how
many
degrees
Celsius
--
or
Fahrenheit
--
the
planet
is
warming
and
what
the
trend
portends
,
but
meanwhile
Earth
's
plants
,
insects
and
animals
are
not
waiting
for
the
outcome
.
They
already
are
altering
their
patterns
of
behavior
in
response
to
what
is
happening
.
It
turns
out
one
of
the
surest
barometers
of
the
warming
climate
is
the
response
of
the
non-human
natural
world
to
changing
conditions
,
and
biologists
who
study
the
responses
have
been
aware
for
some
years
the
biosphere
is
acknowledging
global
warming
.
Nina
Leopold
Bradley
,
a
plant
ecologist
and
daughter
of
the
conservation
pioneer
Aldo
Leopold
,
published
a
1999
paper
in
the
Proceedings
of
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
on
her
61
-
year
uninterrupted
phenological
records
.
Phenology
studies
an
organism
's
development
and
life
cycle
--
the
pulse
of
life
.
Bradley
's
record
of
300
phenophases
found
that
even
prior
to
1999
,
spring
was
arriving
in
higher
latitudes
several
weeks
earlier
than
in
the
earlier
years
of
her
data
.
Birds
arrived
sooner
on
their
migrations
from
the
south
and
plants
flowered
earlier
.
The
Eastern
phoebe
is
showing
up
about
20
days
before
it
used
to
.
The
forest
phlox
is
blooming
in
late
April
instead
of
mid-May
.
Half
of
the
300
phenophases
Leopold
tracked
showed
a
response
consistent
with
warming
.
In
England
,
the
cuckoo
returns
earlier
.
An
analysis
of
65
bird
species
in
the
United
Kingdom
shows
about
one
-
third
are
laying
their
eggs
four
to
seven
days
earlier
than
they
did
25
years
ago
.
One
of
the
major
,
most
well
-
documented
and
robust
findings
in
ecology
over
the
past
century
has
been
the
crucial
role
of
climate
in
determining
the
geographical
distribution
of
species
and
ecological
communities
,
concluded
a
report
titled
"
Observed
Impacts
of
Global
Climate
Change
in
the
United
States
,
"
released
by
the
Pew
Center
on
Global
Climate
last
week
.
Pew
researchers
looked
at
about
40
studies
that
could
provide
an
assessment
of
whether
climate
was
affecting
biology
.
Half
of
the
studies
provide
strong
evidence
of
a
causal
link
between
the
biological
change
and
climate
change
,
said
Camille
Parmesan
,
a
University
of
Texas
-
Austin
biologist
and
one
of
the
world
's
leading
experts
on
this
issue
.
These
changes
are
occurring
across
all
species
,
Parmesan
told
UPI
's
Climate
.
Across
the
United
States
,
the
northern
edge
of
species
'
range
is
expanding
,
she
said
.
Parmesan
has
spent
much
of
her
career
studying
the
checkerspot
butterfly
,
which
migrates
between
Mexico
and
southern
California
.
Some
localized
extinctions
already
have
occurred
across
some
of
its
habitat
.
Empirical
research
pointed
to
climate
as
being
a
strong
driver
,
she
said
.
There
have
been
large
numbers
of
population
extinctions
in
Mexico
and
southern
California
in
areas
where
the
habitat
is
still
acceptable
.
According
to
Parmesan
's
earlier
studies
,
one
extinction
event
,
for
instance
,
was
triggered
when
a
checkerspot
population
migrated
north
prematurely
,
relying
on
a
warming
temperature
signal
,
then
was
caught
in
a
severe
snowstorm
in
its
northern
habitat
.
Throughout
the
United
States
,
she
said
,
"
spring
is
about
two
weeks
earlier
.
Tree
swallows
are
nesting
nine
days
earlier
.
Tropical
species
have
moved
up
to
Florida
and
the
Gulf
Coast
.
Bird
and
butterfly
watchers
are
seeing
many
,
many
new
species
coming
up
from
Mexico
and
the
Caribbean
.
"
As
the
Pew
report
concluded
,
"
Sufficient
studies
now
exist
to
conclude
that
the
consequences
of
climate
change
are
already
detectable
within
U.S.
ecosystems
.
"
Such
consequences
include
shifting
and
,
in
some
cases
,
contraction
of
ranges
and
changes
in
species
composition
within
ecosystems
.
The
report
also
found
alterations
of
ecosystem
processes
such
as
carbon
cycling
and
storage
.
The
Alaskan
tundra
,
for
instance
,
has
switched
from
being
a
net
sink
of
carbon
dioxide
--
absorbing
and
storing
more
carbon
from
the
atmosphere
than
it
releases
--
to
"
being
a
net
source
of
CO2
(
releasing
more
carbon
than
is
stored
)
because
warmer
winters
have
allowed
dead
plant
matter
previously
stored
in
the
soil
to
decompose
and
release
CO2
.
"
The
Pew
report
coincided
with
the
release
in
Iceland
of
the
"
Arctic
Climate
Impact
Assessment
.
"
The
ACIA
--
with
participation
by
the
United
States
,
Canada
,
Denmark
,
Finland
,
Iceland
,
Norway
,
the
Russian
Federation
and
Sweden
--
was
begun
in
2000
.
The
impacts
of
global
warming
are
affecting
people
now
in
the
Arctic
,
said
ACIA
chair
Robert
Corell
.
The
impacts
of
climate
change
on
the
region
and
the
globe
are
projected
to
increase
substantially
in
the
years
to
come
.
"
The
ACIA
found
Arctic
winter
temperatures
have
increased
4
degrees
to
7
degrees
Fahrenheit
in
the
last
50
years
and
should
go
up
about
twice
that
much
in
the
next
100
years
.
Arctic
summer
sea
ice
will
decline
by
50
percent
by
the
end
of
the
21st
century
,
the
assessment
found
,
with
some
models
predicting
complete
disappearance
of
summer
sea
ice
.
Should
the
Arctic
Ocean
become
ice
-
free
in
summer
,
it
is
likely
that
polar
bears
and
some
seal
species
would
be
driven
toward
extinction
,
the
report
concluded
.
As
with
so
much
climate
research
,
not
everyone
agrees
with
these
dire
predictions
.
A
third
report
,
"
The
Impacts
of
Climate
Change
:
An
Appraisal
for
the
Future
,
"
completed
by
the
Britain
-
based
International
Policy
Network
and
released
almost
simultaneously
with
the
other
two
,
falls
somewhat
into
that
category
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
IPN
report
agreed
"
Climate
models
generally
predict
that
the
temperature
rises
in
the
Arctic
will
substantially
exceed
the
global
rise
.
This
applies
especially
in
the
high
Arctic
where
the
ice
cover
is
expected
to
diminish
substantially
with
the
effect
that
the
surface
absorption
of
solar
radiation
will
greatly
increase
.
"
On
the
other
hand
,
the
report
thinks
the
news
might
not
be
so
bad
for
the
North
Atlantic
fisheries
.
The
impact
of
global
warming
on
fish
stocks
and
fisheries
is
hard
to
judge
,
the
IPN
report
said
.
A
warming
of
the
magnitude
predicted
is
more
likely
than
not
to
be
beneficial
to
the
fisheries
of
the
North
Atlantic
.
The
important
commercial
species
that
probably
would
benefit
from
warming
include
cod
,
haddock
,
saithe
,
herring
,
blue
whiting
and
several
types
of
flatfish
and
crustaceans
--
such
as
the
Norway
lobster
.
Important
species
that
probably
would
decline
include
shrimp
,
capelin
,
Greenland
halibut
and
some
varieties
of
flatfish
.
Hidden
in
this
laundry
list
--
and
in
the
pile
of
studies
examined
by
the
Pew
researchers
--
is
one
of
the
fundamental
chasms
dividing
participants
in
the
global
warming
debate
.
The
IPN
report
examines
commercial
fish
species
,
but
it
neglects
important
non-commercial
animals
,
such
as
seals
and
polar
bears
.
In
a
limited
economic
sense
,
therefore
,
the
organization
can
argue
warming
might
be
a
good
thing
.
The
problem
is
whether
one
cares
what
happens
to
the
polar
bears
,
checkerspot
butterflies
and
other
unconsumables
.
The
Pew
researchers
tried
to
transcend
the
economic
argument
.
They
assumed
a
value
--
unspecified
--
for
non-commercial
species
,
and
in
doing
so
rendered
the
warming
news
a
bit
less
rosy
.
This
tug
-
of
-
war
over
calculating
economic
values
is
the
one
that
ultimately
will
have
to
be
decided
by
humans
,
because
animals
and
plants
can
adjust
only
so
much
.
When
dandelions
have
set
the
mark
of
May
on
Wisconsin
pastures
,
it
is
time
to
listen
for
the
final
proof

spring

what
spin
the

Certainly

representation

I
do

will
change
their

came

from

after
winning
a

card
in

Yes

to

the
seed

sown

my
life
.
When
not
in
Texas
,
I
lived
in
LA
and
San
Francisco
.
There
is
a
lot
of
racial
diversity
in
all
of
these
places
...
and
I
've
vacationed
through
the
south
...
visited
my
folks
when
they
lived
in
Mississippi
,
and
where
they
live
now
and
are
in
the
racial
minority
being
white
(
less
than
20
%
)
in
northeastern
Arkansas
.
The
fact
is
,
when
I
began
traveling
for
business
to
New
England
,
when
I
first
visited
my
in
-
laws
in
Montana
and
Idaho
,
I
was
shocked
at
the
lack
of
racial
diversity
.
I
did
n't
expect
to
react
that
way
,
but
when
I
was
looking
around
my
workplace
in
Nashua
,
New
Hampshire
,
and
everyone
else
looked
pretty
much
like
me
,
it
was
really
very
eerie
.
So
,
yes
,
America
has
pockets
that
are
more
diverse
than
others
.
Additionally
,
reviewing
the
standings
of
Louisiana
and
Mississippi
in
the
educational
stakes
,
you
'll
find
they
usually
land
near
the
bottom
of
a
list
of
50
states
.
Unfortunately
,
those
left
behind
to
be
filmed
,
where
those
without
transportation
or
means
.
Some
refused
to
leave
,
but
so
many
were
unable
to
.
Yes
,
it
's
a
valid
reflection
of
America
-
we
do
have
cities
like
this
.
However
,
New
Orleans
also
had
many
affluent
people
,
people
who
left
town
early
as
they
had
the
means
.
I
do
n't
know
if
this
will
change
other
nation
's
perceptions
of
America
.
I
suspect
it
will
not
change
greatly
...
but
you
never
know
how
much
stock
people
put
in
the
news
.
I
do
know
that
this
will
change
the
face
of
America
.
I
expect
that
many
of
the
displaced
people
(
those
affluent
and
those
not
)
will
remain
in
the
places
they
were
evacuated
to
.
The
1.25
million
people
who
have
been
housed
in
stadiums
and
convention
centers
across
Texas
will
begin
to
populate
Houston
,
Dallas
,
San
Antonio
and
Galveston
,
and
the
surrounding
areas
.
Sure
,
some
will
return
,
but
I
have
a
feeling
that
once
many
begin
to
get
jobs
and
temporary
housing
,
they
may
be
shy
about
returning
.
I
'm
interested
in
what
America
will
look
like
in
5
years
.
Will
racial
diversity
find
its
way
to
Wyoming
as
some
people
are
offered
jobs
there
?
Or
will
the
nearly
year
-
round
snow
be
too
much
for
those
who
have
never
experienced
snow
in
their
lives
?
Will
the
housing
market
in
Dallas
begin
booming
like
the
rest
of
the
nation
has
due
to
the
influx
of
buyers
?
Will
businesses
that
were
new
in
2005
have
become
a
household
name
due
to
their
efforts
in
rebuilding
the
gulf
coast
?
What
will
the
federal
government
do
to
prevent
inflation
in
the
housing
and
building
market
?
These
are
some
of
the
things
I
've
been
wondering
...

Juggernaut
Okay
,
I
'm
new
to
this
forum
and
really
do
n't
like
Bush
,
so
my
view
point
is
slanted
and
I
admit
that
.
I
rarely
listen
to
the
news
or
to
what
politicians
or
lawyers
say
because
so
many
tell
lies
that
none
have
credibility
so
what
's
the
point
?
What
I
know
is
that
I
have
a
close
friend
who's
aunt
disappeared
in
New
Orleans
.
My
friend
did
n't
have
computer
capability
,
so
I
spent
the
day
searching
and
posting
online
.
The
family
here
(
California
)
wanted
to
fly
any
family
members
from
there
to
CA
,
so
they
could
remain
here
until
things
got
straightened
out
down
there
.
The
cousins
could
not
be
found
because
no
one
was
sure
of
their
married
names
.
The
hope
was
that
anyone
looking
for
the
Aunt
would
see
the
family
post
and
know
that
help
was
available
.
It
is
Oct.
6
,
and
not
one
family
member
has
been
located
.
What
I
saw
was
dozens
of
school
buses
submerged
that
could
have
been
used
to
evacuate
people
who
had
no
transportation
.
What
I
heard
was
the
Mayor
of
New
Orleans
,
saying
that
he
did
n't
order
the
buses
or
anything
else
to
be
used
because
he
was
waiting
on
someone
else
to
tell
him
what
to
do
.
When
common
sense
takes
a
back
seat
to
politics
and
legal
mumbo
jumbo
what
have
we
become
?
Recently
,
Bush
addressed
the
nation
.
About
30
seconds
into
his
address
,
he
started
flogging
the
terrorist
issue
just
one
more
time
.
Ironically
he
almost
burst
out
laughing
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
mirth
down
to
a
barely
controlled
smirk
.
Even
he
ca
n't
believe
that
he
is
trotting
out
this
old
saw
again
.
I
guess
if
you
have
a
schtick
that
is
a
resounding
success
once
,
you
ca
n't
help
but
trot
it
out
every
time
your
act
is
going
sour
.
Meanwhile
,
every
pocket
that
can
be
lined
is
golden
and
the
poor
are
shunted
off
radar
yet
again
.
The
gall
of
it
all
is
that
Bush
is
stumping
for
more
money
to
build
more
refineries
,
when
what
he
should
do
is
pour
money
into
making
the
US
independent
of
OPEC
or
crude
oil
all
together
.
We
have
the
technology
;
if
you
are
going
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
touting
"
FREEDOM
"
why
not
spend
those
billions
making
all
of
us
free
?
Free
of
polution
,
free
of
oil
dependency
,
and
free
of
big
business
that
is
bleeding
us
dry
for
the
short
term
good
(
theirs
)
.
I
'm
sorry
he
makes
me
want
to
puke
so
I
shut
him
off
.
In
the
meanwhile
there
are
still
broken
families
that
should
have
been
safe
in
the
home
of
the
brave
.
For
those
who
believe

Flexibility
If

be
a
year
of
ups
and
downs
,
and
only
the

be
able
to
keep

going
crazy
!
All
Aries
natives
may
have
to
tighten
their
belts
and
curb
their
desire
for
constant
expansion
.
You
may
need
to
play
it
cool
and
curb
your
spending
.
You
'll
be
among
the
first
to
seize
upon
new
societal
trends
to
create

-
Balance
Finding
a
balance
between
your
personal
and
professional
lives
may
be
one
of
the
year
's
strongest
challenges
.
For
the
most
part
,
your
outward
life
this
year
will
go
in
fits
and
starts
-
alternating
periods
of
intense
activity

can
.
The

in
the
end
you
'll
know
it
was
worth
it
.

-
Abundance
Pursuing
a
successful
career
,
along
with
the
usual
social
and
financial
advantages
,
will
be
easier
this
year
than
it
has
in
a
long
time
for
you
,
Leo
!
The
most
difficult
thing
might
be
deciding
which
path
means
the
most
to
you
,
and
where
to
put
your
focus
.
You
'll
be
able
to
create
opportunities
for
advancement
almost
out
of
thin
air
.
Romance
in
2005
will
make
it
a
year
to
remember
-
and
you
'll
be
the
envy
of
all
your
friends
.
Love
comes
willingly
and
easily
.
Money
may
suddenly
become
tight
at
a
very
inconvenient
time
.
Yet
,
this
is
no
comparison
to
the
advancements
you
'll
make
overall
,
and
by
the
end
of
2005
,
you
'll
look
back
in
sheer
wonder
and
happiness
.
Virgo
in
2005
-
Perseverance
Your
working
life
might
not
go
so
smoothly
this
year
,
Virgo
.
For
much
of
2005
,
you
'll
be
putting
your
nose
to
the
grindstone
.
On
the
bright
side
,
your
finances
will
be
pretty
stable
.
Just
do
n't
take
it
for
granted
-
you
still
need
to
be
cautious
this
year
.
Your
love
life
will
thrive
for
most
of
the
year
,
and
any
relationship
begun
or
reaffirmed
in
2005
is
very
likely
to
be
a
lasting
one
.
And
,
you
're
going
to
develop
a
hopeless
romantic
streak
.
In
spite
of
a
lot
of
worry
over
your
career
,
by
the
year
's
end
,
you
'll
see
that
2005
has
filled
your
life
with
prosperity
and
accomplishments
.

Happiness

If
you

not
presently
married

of
the

.
This
is
the
year
you
're
going
to
be
doing
a
lot
of

is
the

The
one
department
of
life
that
may
not
quite
be
as
hopeful
as
you
'd
like
could
be
your
career
,
where
advancement
may
be
slow
and
satisfaction
rare

you
may
find
yourself
seriously
considering
a
major
change

all

see

showing
up
in
other
important
aspects
of
your
life
.
Your
life
might
take
on
an
entirely
new
direction
you
've
never
dreamed
of
.
You
may
also
change
your
residence
during
the
year
.
Whether
you
start
the
year
as
a
single
person
looking
for
a
partner
,
or
you
've
been
married
for
many
years
,
happiness
in
love
does

Be

be
fascinating

cling

There
were
no
Jews
in
England
to
speak
of
in
the
1590's
.
True
,
but
two
in
England
that
we
know
of
were
a
part
of
the
Essex
entourage
:
Dr.
Lopez
,
who
had
been
physician
to
Essex
'
step
-
father
,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
had
apparently
treated
the
young
Essex
for
some
socially
unacceptable
ailment
,
and
Antonio
Perez
,
who
was
a
guest
at
Essex
House
in
the
early
1590's
.
To
be
sure
,
both
Lopez
&
Perez
were
conversos
--
but
they
were
thought
of
in
England
as
being
,
as
they
undoubtedly
were
,
at
least
ethnically
,
Jews
.
>>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<<
Doctor
RODERIGO
LOPEZ
(
1525
-
1594
)
was
the
Portugese
Jewish
doctor
accused
by
Essex
of
trying
to
poison
Queen
Elizabeth
.
The
69
year
old
Dr.
Lopez
was
found
guilty
and
was
summarily
hung
and
quartered
on
June
7
,
1594
at
Tyburn
.
Long
before
(
September
1560
)
Dr.
Lopez
had
been
the
personal
house
doctor
of
Robert
Dudley
and
the
good
doctor
was
obligated
to
write
the
death
certificate
for
Amy
Robsart
(
stating
that
she
had
"
accidentally
"
fallen
down
the
stairs
)
.
That
same
year
(
1560
)
a
Spanish
priest
named
RUY
LOPEZ
handily
beat
all
comers
at
a
chess
tournament
in

.
Lopez
's

"

:
Nostromo
A
Tale
of
the
Seaboard
<<
After
having
written
so
far
,
Don
Martin
Decoud
,
the
exotic
dandy
of
the
Parisian
boulevard
,
got
up
and
walked
across
the
sanded
floor
of
the
cafe
at
one
end
of
the
Albergo
of
United
Italy
,
kept
by
Giorgio
Viola
,
the
old
companion
of
Garibaldi
.
The
highly
coloured
lithograph
of
the
Faithful
Hero
seemed
to
look
dimly
,
in
the
light
of
one
candle
,
at
the
man
with
no
faith
in
anything
except
the
truth
of
his
own
sensations
.
Looking
out
of
the
window
,
Decoud
was
met
by
a
darkness
so
impenetrable
that
he
could
see
neither
the
mountains
nor
the
town
,
nor
yet
the
buildings
near
the
harbour
;
and
there
was
not
a
sound
,
as
if
the
tremendous
obscurity
of
the
Placid
Gulf
,
spreading
from
the
waters
over
the
land
,
had
made
it
dumb
as
well
as
blind
.
.
.
.
He
turned
away
.
He
could
bear
no
longer
that
expressionless
and
motionless
stare
,
which
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
impenetrable
emptiness
like
the
black
depth
of
an
abyss
.
.
.
.
and
uneasy
in
its
corporate
expression
,
was
overtopped
by
the
big
face
of
Don
Juste
Lopez
,
soft
and
white
,
with
prominent
eyelids
and
wreathed
in
impenetrable
solemnity
as
if
in
a
dense
cloud
.

Wisteria
Lodge

He
could
do
little
during
the
day
,
for
Murillo
took
every
precaution
and
never
went
out
save
with
his
satellite
Lucas
,
or
Lopez
as
he
was
known
in
the
days
of
his
greatness
.
At
night
,
however
,
he
slept
alone
,
and
the
avenger
might
find
him
.
On
a
certain
evening
,
which
had
been
prearranged
,
I
sent
my
friend
final
instructions
,
for
the
man
was
forever
on
the
alert
and
continually
changed
his
room
.
I
was
to
see
that
the
doors
were
open
and
the
signal
of
a
green
or
white
light
in
a
window
which
faced
the
drive
was
to
give
notice
if
all
was
safe
or
if
the
attempt
had
better
be
postponed
.
In
some
way
I
had
excited
the
suspicion
of
Lopez
,
the
secretary
.
He
crept
up
behind
me
and
sprang
upon
me
just
as
I
had
finished
the
note
.
He
and
his
master
dragged
me
to
my
room
and
held
judgment
upon
me
as
a
convicted
traitress
.
Then
and
there
they
would
have
plunged
their
knives
into
me
could
they
have
seen
how
to
escape
the
consequences
of
the
deed
.
Finally
,
after
much
debate
,
they
concluded
that
my
murder
was
too
dangerous
.
But
they
determined
to
get
rid
forever
of
Garcia
.
They
had
gagged
me
,
and
Murillo
twisted
my
arm
round
until
I
gave
him
the
address
.
I
swear
that
he
might
have
twisted
it
off
had
I
understood
what
it
would
mean
to
Garcia
.
Lopez
addressed
the
note
which
I
had
written
,
sealed
it
with
his
sleeve
-
link
,
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
the
servant
,
Jose
.
How
they
murdered
him
I
do
not
know
,
save
that
it
was
Murillo
's
hand
who
struck
him
down
,
for
Lopez
had
remained
to
guard
me
.
I
believe
he
must
have
waited
among
the
gorse
bushes
through
which
the
path
winds
and
struck
him
down
as
he
passed
.
At
first
they
were
of
a
mind
to
let
him
enter
the
house
and
to
kill
him
as
a
detected
burglar
;
but
they
argued
that
if
they
were
mixed
up
in
an
inquiry
their
own
identity
would
at
once
be
publicly
disclosed
and
they
would
be
open
to
further
attacks
.
With
the
death
of
Garcia
,
the
pursuit
might
cease
,
since
such
a
death
might
frighten
others
from
the
task
.

The
Rock
revolution
happened
in
the
Sixties
(
6
,
number
of
the
Beast
)
.
It
came
from
Liverpool
,
that
was
the
port
base
to
the
Titanic
,
destroyed
by
God
because
of
the
arrogant
insult
of
captain
Smith
(
also
from
Liverpool
)
:
"
Not
even
God
can
sink
my
ship
"
(
not
only
the
captain
,
but
also
the
rest
of
the
crew
and
even
the
orchestra
playing
at
the
Titanic
were
from
Liverpool
)
.
The
Rock
revolution
came
from
the
nation
that
allows
a
church
to
be
changed
to
a
pub
or
to
a
dance
room
or
to
a
recording
studio
full
of
drug
addicts
,
homosexuals
and
lunatics
(
as
that
of
George
Martin
,
ally
of
the
Beatles
)
.
It
came
from
the
nation
whose
king
Enrique
VIII
adulterated
the
Bible
so
that
divorce
could
be
allowed
and
in
this
way
be
able
to
give
loose
rein
to
the
many
divorces
from
his
wives
and
subsequent
murdering
of
the
same
ones
and
to
whom
God
provided
a
wife
with
six
fingers
as
abomination
(
Anne
Boleyn
)
...
once
again
6
,
number
of
the
Beast
....
It
is
interesting
to
observe
that
this
nation
is
nicknamed
"
the
Devil
's
Island
"
.
As
the
epithet
of
the
government
of
Satan
on
that
nation
,
the
center
of
London
,
the
so
well
-
known
Piccadilly
Circus
,
takes
it's
name
from
an
old
brothel
(
the
"
Piccadilla
House
"
which
means
"
The
House
of
Sin
"
)
,
disappeared
nowadays
.
The
antichrist
John
Lennon
,
one
of
the
Devil
's
main
puppets
to
destroy
family
,
social
and
moral
values
and
to
begin
the
disintegration
of
mankind
,
did
hit
Stuart
Sutcliffe
(
the
first
bass
player
of
the
Beatles
)
in
the
head
with
a
club
repeatedly
in
Hamburg
.
Some
months
later
Sutcliffe
died
from
brain
haemorrhage
because
of
John
Lennon
's
bruises
.
John
Lennon
entered
stardom
being
a
murderer
.
The
same
demons
that
made
captain
Smith
say
"
Not
even
God
can
sink
my
ship
"
spoke
from
antichrist
John
Lennon
(
from
Liverpool
,
base
port
to
the
Titanic
)
saying
:
"
Christianity
is
on
the
go
.
It
will
vanish
and
shrink
.
We
are
more
popular
than
Jesus
and
Pope
"
....
That
was
the
day
that
GOD
'S
CURSE
fell
upon
the
world
of
Rock
.
One
week
after
that
declaration
,
ONLY
ONE
WEEK
LATER
,
Brian
Epstein
,
forger
of
the
Beatle
farce
,
died
from
an
overdose
.
From
then
on
,
the
Beatles
began
to
get
involved
in
false
religions
and
to
preach
them
to
the
world
.
John
Lennon
's
divorce
followed
,
as
well
as
his
entering
the
world
of
black
magic
,
as
deeply
as
to
buy
the
apartment
.
where
the
"
Rosemary
's
baby
"
had
been
filmed
,
previous
property
of
Roman
Polansky
,
and
in
that
same
apartment
John
Lennon
had
a
room
upholstered
with
black
silk
where
he
used
to
do
his
black
magic
operations
.
Came
the
disintegration
of
the
Beatles
'
minds
with
LSD
which
has
caused
,
among
others
,
schizophrenic
lyrics
such
as
"
I
am
the
Walrus
"
and
incoherent
schizophrenic
musical
expositions
like
"
Revolution
number
9
"
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
devil
acted
through
his
other
main
puppets
with
"
Sympathy
for
the
devil
"
that
was
when
the
pact
of
the
Rolling
Stones
with
Satan
took
the
life
of
the
founder
of
the
group
,
the
guitarist
Brian
Jones
(
who
refused
to
be
a
puppet
of
the
devil
)
,
murdered
by
people
sent
by
Mick
Jagger
,
another
assassin
.
Antichrist
John
Lennon
followed
the
Devil
's
strategy
writing
lyrics
such
as
"
God
is
a
concept
by
which
we
measure
our
pain
...
I
do
n't
believe
in
Jesus
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
"
(
God
)
and
"
and
no
religions
too
...
"
(
Imagine
)
.
Antichrist
John
Lennon
wanted
to
compete
with
Jesus
Christ
,
and
so
he
grew
a
beard
and
started
to
make
a
bogus
role
of
Christ
together
with
Yoko
Ono
at
the
Amsterdam
Hilton
hotel
proclaiming
"
Peace
"
,
being
then
when
he
was
visited
by
the
Canadian
journalist
who
ridiculized
and
admonished
him
wanting
to
know
about
what
Lennon
meant
when
he
wrote
in
the
lyrics
of
"
The
ballad
of
John
and
Yoko
"
:
"
the
way
things
are
going
,
they
're
going
to
crucify
me
...
"
,
The
CURSE
OF
GOD
upon
John
Lennon
carried
on
with
all
type
of
miseries
and
distresses
which
made
Lennon
give
the
interview
to
the
"
Rolling
Stone
"
magazine
(
today
condensed
in
the
"
Lennon
remembers
"
book
)
where
he
speaks
about
how
bad
thing
were
going
for
him
blaming
"
whatever
is
up
there
"
for
it
(
referring
to
God
)
.
The
CURSE
OF
GOD
carried
on
until
he
was
shot
dead
.
It
is
interesting
to
notice
that
he
was
shot
seven
times
,
being
seven
,
as
well
as
three
,
the
holy
numbers
in
Holy
Cabalah
tradition
....
After
George
Harrison
,
said
arrogantly
in
a
video
filmed
in
his
studio
at
Henley
on
Thames
:
"
I
want
to
talk
about
the
divinity
of
man
"
,
he
was
given
throat
cancer
by
GOD
because
of
those
words
,
which
made
metastasis
and
carried
on
to
final
death
..
To
Paul
McCartney
whose
company
's
logo
was
a
person
toying
with
the
planets
as
if
he
was
a
god
,
and
who
was
being
very
much
deluded
in
his
ego
trip
by
the
fact
that
he
was
made
"
Sir
"
(
when
in
England
even
the
road
sweeper
is
made
Sir
,
as
long
as
he
produces
money
for
the
nation
)
,
GOD
provided
cancer
to
the
wife
.
The
advertising
farce
of
how
much
he
loved
Linda
(
woman
whose
quality
he
did
not
deserve
)
,
was
exposed
when
it
was
known
that
Paul
had
an
affair
with
Heather
Mills
,
Linda
's
intimate
friend
,
with
whom
McCartney
went
on
a
trip
to
New
York
and
to
whom
he
bought
things
and
presents
,
while
he
was
still
mourning
for
his
"
dear
Linda
"
.
At
the
same
time
McCartney
was
going
out
with
Heather
Mills
,
he
used
Linda
's
death
for
promotional
ends
,
due
to
his
waning
popularity
.
Paul
was
going
out
with
Heather
,
but
in
front
of
the
audience
he
played
the
faithful
husband
's
masquerade
pretending
to
suffer
for
Linda
,
for
the
afore
mentioned
promotional
ends
.
Paul
admitted
that
he
made
Linda
suffer
a
lot
,
but
he
did
n't
say
that
it
was
because
he
felt
insecure
as
a
man
due
to
his
womanish
face
and
effeminate
manners
and
also
because
with
his
age
his
sexual
power
was
not
the
same
,
even
though
it
has
never
been
much
.
The
early
days
were
the
days
of
competition
between
Paul
and
his
wife
and
John
and
his
wife
and
he
knew
he
had
to
compete
with
ugly
John
for
the
leadership
of
the
band
in
front
of
their
wives
and
having
Yoko
Ono
made
him
aware
of
his
lack
of
virility
and
repressed
homosexuality
,
he
grew
the
beard
that
we
see
in
the
"
Let
it
Be
"
film
and
started
to
show
pictures
of
naked
women
in
the
same
film
,
doing
every
effort
he
could
to
be
seen
as
a
man
....
It
is
easy
to
note
the
uneasiness
of
McCartney
when
he
sings
:
"
I
've
got
a
feeling
,
a
feeling
I
ca
n't
hide
...
"
in
front
of
Yoko
in
the
film
.
(
He
already
had
the
traumas
that
his
previous
girlfriend
Jane
Asher
had
caused
him
when
she
made
him
aware
of
his
little
manliness
and
effeminate
manners
)
.
Paul
has
such
a
big
inferiority
complex
as
a
man
,
due
to
his
effeminate
face
,
body
and
personality
and
due
to
his
repressed
homosexuality
,
that
he
found
himself
a
handicapped
woman
with
only
one
leg
,
so
that
he
could
stand
out
,
being
very
conscious
that
a
full
woman
would
make
him
feel
the
superiority
of
virile
men
again
,
as
Jane
and
Linda
did
.
This
is
something
that
his
ego
trip
of
lucky
bad
musician
could
not
face
anymore
....
He
is
very
conscious
that
money
and
fame
can
not
buy
virility
and
manliness
.
Besides
being
a
murderer
,
John
Lennon
had
sexual
intercourse
with
homosexual
Brian
Epstein
to
get
him
interested
in
going
to
see
the
band
at
the
Cavern
,
trauma
from
which
he
never
recovered
.
Because
of
the
trauma
that
his
homosexual
relation
with
Brian
Epstein
had
left
him
,
he
made
lyrics
such
as
:
"
You
can
wear
a
collar
and
a
tie
,
one
thing
you
ca
n't
hide
is
when
you
're
crippled
inside
"
and
gave
declarations
to
the
"
Rolling
Stone
"
magazine
saying
that
"
sometimes
he
wore
Texan
boots
to
feel
more
secure
as
a
man
"
.
The
Beatles
are
very
well
known
by
people
close
to
them
for
their
arrogance
and
racism
.
One
of
the
manifestations
of
their
racism
is
the
rejection
towards
Japanese
Yoko
Ono
.
That
rejection
got
to
the
point
that
George
Harrison
kicked
Yoko
Ono
in
the
Apple
studios
during
the
filming
of
Let
it
Be
.
When
John
asked
George
while
they
were
having
lunch
about
how
things
were
going
for
Paul
after
his
separation
from
the
Beatles
and
George
replied
that
he
was
number
one
in
the
Swedish
hit
parade
,
John
said
in
a
despective
manner
:
"
ah
!!
..
in
Sweden
..
"
,
as
if
Sweden
was
an
inferior
place
or
something
alike
.
In
the
Beatles
'
song
"
Get
Back
"
they
advise
black
Joe
to
"
get
back
to
where
you
once
belonged
"
,
as
if
England
was
not
a
place
for
black
people
.
Sometimes
back
,
Paul
told
George
in
the
Apple
offices
that
the
new
generations
are
a
bundle
of
idiots
and
useless
people
,
but
in
any
way
they
would
have
also
been
slaves
of
the
Beatles
.
The
Jewish
marriage
living
to
the
right
of
George
's
house
said
that
he
is
an
arrogant
person
who
does
never
return
a
greeting
.
The
newly
married
couple
living
on
the
corner
in
front
of
the
entrance
of
George
's
house
(
Friar
Park
)
refers
to
him
as
an
overbearing
person
to
stay
away
from
.
The
receptionist
of
"
Hand
made
"
,
the
former
film
making
company
of
George
Harrison
said
:
"
we
do
n't
have
any
relation
with
that
man
anymore
and
we
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
about
him
"
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
company
was
made
bankrupt
by
the
British
cinema
industry
due
to
the
despotism
and
pedantry
of
George
Harrison
,
who
believed
that
the
cinema
industry
would
have
worshiped
him
.
Their
chauvinisms
got
to
the
point
that
even
they
themselves
hated
each
other
.
Paul
McCartney
said
that
George
Harrison
is
a
nothing
.
George
Harrison
said
that
he
is
tired
of
listening
to
people
talk
about
John
Lennon
....
George
Harrison
said
in
a
video
that
"
Oasis
is
a
very
untalented
band
and
they
should
n't
be
playing
at
all
"
,
all
of
it
being
the
truth
,
but
the
Beatles
is
also
a
band
of
very
poor
musicians
,
if
musicians
at
all
,
who
could
only
play
a
couple
of
elementary
guitar
chords
and
who
are
as
untalented
as
Oasis
.
The
Beatles
of
the
times
of
the
"
Cavern
"
sounded
exactly
as
poorly
as
Oasis
and
the
little
musical
quality
in
the
songs
of
the
Beatles
is
due
to
George
Martin
.
Without
George
Martin
the
Beatles
would
have
been
just
another
untalented
band
as
Oasis
....
Paul
McCartney
said
recently
that
he
believes
in
using
magic
,
and
he
does
lots
of
charity
,
thinking
that
in
this
way
he
will
compensate
for
the
CURSE
OF
GOD
that
is
upon
him
and
that
took
his
wife
's
life
because
of
his
Satanism
and
involvement
in
black
magic
.
He
thinks
he
will
deceive
people
in
this
way
,
so
that
the
real
McCartney
will
not
be
perceived
.
Is
the
old
Devil
attempting
to
disguise
as
good
in
front
of
people
.
Satan
deceiving
mankind
once
again
,
as
so
many
other
thousands
of
times
through
the
centuries
....
After
the
Devil
began
his
devastating
job
from
the
ghostly
"
Devil
's
Island
"
through
his
nine
main
puppets
(
Beatles
-
Rolling
Stones
)
,
he
possessed
an
endless
amount
of
other
schizophrenic
bad
musician
in
the
afore
mentioned
Island
and
weakening
their
conscience
with
drugs
,
he
made
them
proclaimers
of
homosexuality
,
aversion
to
religion
,
destruction
of
family
values
,
dissipation
,
mental
illness
,
antisocialism
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
The
fact
that
bad
apprentice
musicians
such
as
the
Beatles
and
the
Rolling
Stones
achieved
such
a
giant
fame
that
not
even
the
real
quality
musicians
could
achieve
,
was
because
the
forces
of
Satan
were
behind
everything
,
supporting
the
process
.
This
mentally
ill
humanity
,
destroyed
families
,
twisted
moral
values
,
manifest
or
repressed
homosexuality
in
human
beings
,
anti
natural
feminism
rebellion
,
drug
addiction
,
corrupt
social
outlines
,
mad
youths
without
direction
,
non
respect
to
hierarchies
,
convulsed
nations
,
misanthropy
,
misogyny
,
paedophilia
,
irrational
and
feeble
lasciviousness
and
all
other
type
of
existent
aberrations
,
are
due
to
the
vast
manoeuvre
that
Satan
executed
through
his
main
marionettes
the
Beatles
and
the
Rolling
Stones
,
from
the
Devil
's
Island
.
If
you
wonder
why
there
is
misery
and
curse
in
your
house
,
it
is
because
you
own
some
L.P
,
CD
or
another
article
related
to
the
CURSED
BY
GOD
Beatles
and

.
We
recommend
you
to
take
that
curse
out
of
your
house
throwing
away
everything
related
to
the
Devil
's
main
nine
puppets

You

Attack
on
Iran
:
A
Looming
Folly
By

Perspective
Monday
09
January
2006
The
wires
have
been
humming
since
before
the
New
Year
with
reports
that
the
Bush
administration
is
planning
an
attack
on
Iran
.
The
Bush
administration
is
preparing
its
NATO
allies
for
a
possible
military
strike
against
suspected
nuclear
sites
in
Iran
in
the
New
Year
,
according
to
German
media
reports
,
reinforcing
similar
earlier
suggestions
in
the
Turkish
media
,
reported
UPI
on
December
30th
.
The
Berlin
daily
Der
Tagesspiegel
this
week
,
continued
UPI
,
"
quoted
'
NATO
intelligence
sources
'
who
claimed
that
the
NATO
allies
had
been
informed
that
the
United
States
is
currently
investigating
all
possibilities
of
bringing
the
mullah
-
led
regime
into
line
,
including
military
options
.
This
'
all
options
are
open
'
line
has
been
President
George
W
Bush
's
publicly
stated
policy
throughout
the
past
18
months
.
"
An
examination
of
the
ramifications
of
such
an
attack
is
desperately
in
order
.

.
Blowback
in
Iraq
The
recent
elections
in
Iraq
were
dominated
by
an
amalgam
of
religiously
fundamentalist
Shi'ite
organizations
,
principally
the
Dawa
Party
and
the
Supreme
Council
for
Islamic
Revolution
in
Iraq
(
SCIRI
)
.
Both
Dawa
and
SCIRI
have
umbilical
connections
to
the
fundamentalist
Shi'ite
leadership
in
Iran
that
go
back
decades
.
In
essence
,
Iran
now
owns
a
significant
portion
of
the
Iraqi
government
.
Should
the
United
States
undertake
military
action
against
Iran
,
the
ramifications
in
Iraq
would
be
immediate
and
extreme
.
In
the
first
eight
days
of
January
,
eighteen
US
troops
have
been
killed
in
Iraq
,
compounded
by
another
twelve
deaths
from
a
Black
Hawk
helicopter
crash
on
Saturday
.
Much
of
the
violence
aimed
at
American
forces
is
coming
from
disgruntled
Sunni
factions
that
have
their
own
militias
,
believe
the
last
elections
were
a
sham
,
and
hold
little
political
power
in
the
government
.
If
the
US
attacks
Iran
,
it
is
probable
that
American
forces
-
already
taxed
by
attacks
from
Sunni
factions
-
will
also
face
reprisal
attacks
in
Iraq
from
Shi'ite
factions
loyal
to
Iran
.
The
result
will
be
a
dramatic
escalation
in
US
and
civilian
casualties
,
US
forces
will
be
required
to
bunker
themselves
further
into
their
bases
,
and
US
forces
will
find
themselves
required
to
fight
the
very
government
they
just
finished
helping
into
power
.
Iraq
,
already
a
seething
cauldron
,
will
sink
further
into
chaos
.

.
Iran
's
Armaments
Unlike
Iraq
,
Iran
has
not
spent
the
last
fifteen
years
having
its
conventional
forces
worn
down
by
grueling
sanctions
,
repeated
attacks
,
and
two
American
-
led
wars
.
While
Iran
's
conventional
army
is
not
what
it
was
during
the
heyday
of
the
Iran
-
Iraq
war
-
their
armaments
have
deteriorated
and
the
veterans
of
that
last
war
have
retired
-
the
nation
enjoys
substantial
military
strength
nonetheless
.
According
to
a
report
issued
by
the
Center
for
Strategic
and
International
Studies
in
December
of
2004
,
Iran
"
has
some
540,000
men
under
arms
and
over
350,000
reserves
.
They
include
120,000
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guards
trained
for
land
and
naval
asymmetrical
warfare
.
Iran
's
military
also
includes
holdings
of
1,613
main
battle
tanks
,
21,600
other
armored
fighting
vehicles
,
3,200
artillery
weapons
,
306
combat
aircraft
,
60
attack
helicopters
,
3
submarines
,
59
surface
combatants
,
and
10
amphibious
ships
.
"
Iran
is
now
the
only
regional
military
power
that
poses
a
significant
conventional
military
threat
to
Gulf
stability
,
continued
the
CSIS
report
.
There
is
considerable
evidence
that
it
is
developing
both
a
long
-
range
missile
force
and
a
range
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
.
It
has
never
properly
declared
its
holdings
of
chemical
weapons
,
and
the
status
of
its
biological
weapons
programs
is
unknown
.
"
A
MILNET
brief
issued
in
February
2005
reports
,
"
Due
to
its
position
astride
the
Persian
Gulf
,
Iran
has
constantly
been
a
threat
to
the
Gulf
.
The
so
called
'
Tanker
'
wars
in
the
late
1980s
put
Iran
squarely
in
the
bullseye
of
all
nations
seeking
to
transport
oil
out
of
the
region
.
Even
the
small
navy
that
Iran
puts
to
sea
is
capable
enough
to
harass
shipping
,
and
several
cases
of
small
boat
operations
against
oil
well
heads
in
the
Gulf
during
that
period
made
it
clear
small
asymmetrical
tactics
of
the
Iranian
Navy
could
be
quite
effective
.
"
More
concerning
,
continued
the
MILNET
brief
,
"
is
the
priority
placed
on
expanding
and
modernizing
its
Navy
.
The
CSIS
report
cites
numerous
areas
where
Iran
has
funded
modernization
including
the
most
troublesome
aspect
,
anti-shipping
cruise
missiles
:
'
Iran
has
obtained
new
anti-ship
missiles
and
missile
patrol
craft
from
China
,
midget
submarines
from
North
Korea
,
submarines
from
Russia
,
and
modern
mines
.
'
"
It
is
Iran
's
missile
armaments
that
pose
the
greatest
concern
for
American
forces
in
the
Gulf
,
especially
for
the
US
Navy
.
Iran
's
coast
facing
the
Persian
Gulf
is
a
looming
wall
of
mountains
that
look
down
upon
any
naval
forces
arrayed
in
those
waters
.
The
Gulf
itself
only
has
one
exit
,
the
Strait
of
Hormuz
,
which
is
also
dominated
by
the
mountainous
Iranian
coastline
.
In
essence
,
Iran
holds
the
high
ground
in
the
Gulf
.
Missile
batteries
arrayed
in
those
mountains
could
raise
bloody
havoc
with
any
fleet
deployed
below
.
Of
all
the
missiles
in
Iran
's
armament
,
the
most
dangerous
is
the
Russian
-
made
SS
-
N
-
22
Sunburn
.
These
missiles
are
,
simply
,
the
fastest
anti-ship
weapons
on
the
planet
.
The
Sunburn
can
reach
Mach
3
at
high
altitude
.
Its
maximum
low
-
altitude
speed
is
Mach
2.2
,
some
three
times
faster
than
the
American
-
made
Harpoon
.
The
Sunburn
takes
two
short
minutes
to
cover
its
full
range
.
The
missile
's
manufacturers
state
that
one
or
two
missiles
could
cripple
a
destroyer
,
and
five
missiles
could
sink
a
20,000
ton
ship
.
The
Sunburn
is
also
superior
to
the
Exocet
missile
.
Recall
that
it
was
two
Exocets
that
ripped
the
USS
Stark
to
shreds
in
1987
,
killing
37
sailors
.
The
Stark
could
not
see
them
to
stop
them
.
The
US
aircraft
carrier
Theodore
Roosevelt
is
currently
deployed
in
the
Persian
Gulf
,
with
some
7,000
souls
aboard
.
Sailing
with
the
Roosevelt
is
the
Tarawa
Expeditionary
Strike
Force
,
which
includes
the
USS
Tarawa
,
the
USS
Austin
,
and
the
USS
Pearl
Harbor
.
The
USS
Austin
is
likewise
deployed
in
the
Gulf
.
The
Sunburn
missile
,
with
its
incredible
speed
and
ability
to
avoid
radar
detection
,
would
do
terrible
damage
these
ships
if
Iran
chooses
to
retaliate
in
the
Gulf
after
an
American
attack
within
its
borders
.
Beyond
the
naval
threat
is
the
possibility
of
Iran
throwing
its
military
muscle
into
the
ongoing
struggle
in
Iraq
.
Currently
,
the
US
is
facing
an
asymmetrical
attack
from
groups
wielding
small
arms
,
shoulder
-
fired
grenades
and
roadside
bombs
.
The
vaunted
American
military
has
suffered
2,210
deaths
and
tens
of
thousands
of
wounded
from
this
form
of
warfare
.
The
occupation
of
Iraq
has
become
a
guerrilla
war
,
a
siege
that
has
lasted
more
than
a
thousand
days
.
If
Iran
decides
to
throw
any
or
all
of
its
23,000
armored
fighting
vehicles
,
along
with
any
or
all
of
its
nearly
million
-
strong
army
,
into
the
Iraq
fray
,
the
situation
in
the
Middle
East
could
become
unspeakably
dire
.
3
.
The
Syrian
Connection
In
February
of
2005
,
Iran
and
Syria
agreed
upon
a
mutual
protection
pact
to
combat
"
challenges
and
threats
"
in
the
region
.
This
was
a
specific
reaction
to
the
American
invasion
of
Iraq
,
and
a
reaction
to
America
's
condemnation
of
Syria
after
the
death
of
Lebanese
Prime
Minister
Rafik
Hariri
,
which
was
widely
seen
as
an
assassination
ordered
from
Damascus
.
An
attack
on
Iran
would
trigger
this
mutual
defense
pact
,
and
could
conceivably
bring
Syria
into
direct
conflict
with
American
forces
.
Like
Iran
,
Syria
's
military
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
.
Virtually
every
credible
analysis
has
Syria
standing
as
the
strongest
military
force
in
the
Middle
East
after
Israel
.
Damascus
has
been
intent
for
years
upon
establishing
significant
military
strength
to
serve
as
a
counterweight
to
Israel
's
overwhelming
capabilities
.
As
of
2002
,
Syria
had
some
215,000
soldiers
under
arms
,
4,700
tanks
,
and
a
massive
artillery
capability
.
The
Syrian
Air
Force
is
comprised
of
ten
to
eleven
fighter
/
attack
squadrons
and
sixteen
fighter
squadrons
,
totaling
somewhere
near
650
aircraft
.
Syria
also
possesses
one
of
the
largest
arsenals
of
ballistic
missiles
in
the
region
,
comprised
primarily
of
SCUD
-
derived
systems
.
Iran
,
North
Korea
and
China
have
been
willing
providers
of
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
technologies
.
Compounding
this
is
the
well
-
based
suspicion
that
Syria
has
perhaps
the
most
advanced
chemical
weapons
capability
in
the
Persian
Gulf
.

China
and
the
US
Economy
While
the
ominous
possibilities
of
heightened
Iraqi
chaos
,
missiles
in
the
Gulf
,
and
Syrian
involvement
loom
large
if
the
US
attacks
Iran
,
all
pale
in
comparison
to
the
involvement
of
China
in
any
US
/
Iran
engagement
.
China
's
economy
is
exploding
,
hampered
only
by
their
great
thirst
for
petroleum
and
natural
gas
to
fuel
their
industry
.
In
the
last
several
months
,
China
has
inked
deals
with
Iran
for
$
70
billion
dollars
worth
of
Iranian
oil
and
natural
gas
.
China
will
purchase
250
million
tons
of
liquefied
natural
gas
from
Iran
over
the
next
30
years
,
will
develop
the
massive
Yadavaran
oil
field
in
Iran
,
and
will
receive
150,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day
from
that
field
.
China
is
seeking
the
construction
of
a
pipeline
from
Iran
to
the
Caspian
Sea
,
where
it
would
link
with
another
planned
pipeline
running
from
Kazakhstan
to
China
.
Any
US
attack
on
Iran
could
be
perceived
by
China
as
a
direct
threat
to
its
economic
health
.
Further
,
any
fighting
in
the
Persian
Gulf
would
imperil
the
tankers
running
China
's
liquefied
natural
gas
through
the
Strait
of
Hormuz
.
Should
China
decide
to
retaliate
against
the
US
to
defend
its
oil
and
natural
gas
deal
with
Iran
,
the
US
would
be
faced
with
a
significant
threat
.
This
threat
exists
not
merely
on
a
military
level
,
though
China
could
force
a
confrontation
in
the
Pacific
by
way
of
Taiwan
.
More
significantly
,
China
holds
a
large
portion
of
the
American
economy
in
the
palm
of
its
hand
.
Paul
Craig
Roberts
,
writing
for
The
American
Conservative
,
said
in
July
of
2005
that
"
As
a
result
of
many
years
of
persistent
trade
surpluses
with
the
United
States
,
the
Japanese
government
holds
dollar
reserves
of
approximately
$
1
trillion
.
China
's
accumulation
of
dollars
is
approximately
$
600
billion
.
South
Korea
holds
about
$
200
billion
.
These
sums
give
these
countries
enormous
leverage
over
the
United
States
.
By
dumping
some
portion
of
their
reserves
,
these
countries
could
put
the
dollar
under
intense
pressure
and
send
U.S.
interest
rates
skyrocketing
.
Washington
would
really
have
to
anger
Japan
and
Korea
to
provoke
such
action
,
but
in
a
showdown
with
China
-
over
Taiwan
,
for
example
-
China
holds
the
cards
.
China
and
Japan
,
and
the
world
at
large
,
have
more
dollar
reserves
than
they
require
.
They
would
have
no
problem
teaching
a
hegemonic
superpower
a
lesson
if
the
need
arose
.
"
The
hardest
blow
on
Americans
,
concluded
Roberts
,
"
will
fall
when
China
does
revalue
its
currency
.
When
China
's
currency
ceases
to
be
undervalued
,
American
shoppers
in
Wal
-
Mart
,
where
70
percent
of
the
goods
on
the
shelves
are
made
in
China
,
will
think
they
are
in
Neiman
Marcus
.
Price
increases
will
cause
a
dramatic
reduction
in
American
real
incomes
.
If
this
coincides
with
rising
interest
rates
and
a
setback
in
the
housing
market
,
American
consumers
will
experience
the
hardest
times
since
the
Great
Depression
.
"
In
short
,
China
has
the
American
economy
by
the
throat
.
Should
they
decide
to
squeeze
,
we
will
all
feel
it
.
China
's
strong
hand
in
this
even
extends
to
the
diplomatic
realm
;
China
is
a
permanent
member
of
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
,
and
could
veto
any
actions
against
Iran
proposed
by
the
United
States
.

.
American
Preparedness
American
citizens
have
for
decades
taken
it
as
a
given
that
our
military
can
overwhelm
and
overcome
any
foe
on
the
battlefield
.
The
rapid
victory
during
the
first
Gulf
War
cemented
this
perception
.
The
last
three
years
of
the
Iraq
occupation
,
however
,
have
sapped
this
confidence
.
Worse
,
the
occupation
has
done
great
damage
to
the
strength
of
the
American
military
,
justifying
the
decrease
in
confidence
.
Thanks
to
repeated
deployments
to
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
recruiting
is
at
an
all
-
time
low
.
Soldiers
with
vital
training
and
know
-
how
are
refusing
to
re-enlist
.
Across
the
board
,
the
American
military
is
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
.
Two
vaunted
economists
-
one
a
Nobel
Prize
winner
and
the
other
a
nationally
renowned
budget
expert
-
have
analyzed
the
data
at
hand
and
put
a
price
tag
on
the
Iraq
occupation
.
According
to
Linda
Bilmes
of
Harvard
and
Nobel
Laureate
Joseph
E.
Stiglitz
of
Columbia
University
,
the
final
cost
of
the
Iraq
occupation
will
run
between
$
1
trillion
and
$
2
trillion
,
surpassing
by
orders
of
magnitude
the
estimates
put
forth
by
the
Bush
administration
.
If
an
engagement
with
Iran
envelops
our
forces
in
Iraq
,
and
comes
to
involve
Syria
,
our
economy
will
likely
shatter
under
the
strain
of
fighting
so
many
countries
simultaneously
.
Add
to
this
the
economic
threat
posed
by
China
,
and
the
economic
threat
implicit
in
any
substantial
disruption
of
the
distribution
of
Mideast
petroleum
to
the
globe
.
If
Iran
and
Syria
-
with
their
significant
armaments
,
missile
technologies
and
suspected
chemical
weapons
capabilities
-
decide
to
engage
with
the
relatively
undersized
US
force
in
Iraq
,
our
troops
there
will
be
fish
in
a
barrel
.
Iran
's
position
over
the
Gulf
would
make
resupply
by
ship
and
air
support
from
carriers
a
dangerous
affair
.
In
the
worst
-
case
scenario
,
the
newly
-
minted
American
order
of
battle
requiring
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
to
rescue
a
surrounded
and
imperiled
force
could
come
into
play
,
hurling
the
entire
planet
into
military
and
diplomatic
bedlam
.
Conclusion
:
Is
Any
of
This
Possible
?
The
question
must
be
put
as
directly
as
possible
:
what
manner
of
maniac
would
undertake
a
path
so
fraught
with
peril
and
potential
economic
catastrophe
?
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
justification
for
any
action
that
could
envelop
the
United
States
in
a
military
and
economic
conflict
with
Iraq
,
Iran
,
Syria
and
China
simultaneously
.
Iran
is
suspected
by
many
nations
of
working
towards
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
,
but
even
this
justification
has
been
tossed
into
a
cocked
hat
.
Recently
,
Russian
president
Vladimir
Putin
bluntly
stated
that
Iran
is
not
developing
its
nuclear
capability
for
any
reasons
beyond
peaceful
energy
creation
,
and
pledged
to
continue
assisting
Iran
in
this
endeavor
.
Therefore
,
any
attack
upon
Iran
's
nuclear
facilities
will
bring
Russia
into
the
mess
.
Iran
also
stands
accused
of
aiding
terrorism
across
the
globe
.
The
dangers
implicit
in
any
attack
upon
that
nation
,
however
,
seem
to
significantly
offset
whatever
gains
could
be
made
in
the
so
-
called
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
Unfortunately
,
all
the
dangers
in
the
world
are
no
match
for
the
self
-
assurance
of
a
bubble
-
encased
zealot
.
What
manner
of
maniac
would
undertake
such
a
dangerous
course
?
Look
no
further
than
1600
Pennsylvania
Avenue
.
George
W.
Bush
and
his
administration
have
consistently
undertaken
incredibly
dangerous
courses
of
action
in
order
to
garner
political
power
on
the
home
front
.
Recall
the
multiple
terror
threats
lobbed
out
by
the
administration
whenever
damaging
political
news
appeared
in
the
media
.
More
significantly
,
recall
Iraq
.
Karl
Rove
,
Bush
's
most
senior
advisor
,
notoriously
told
Republicans
on
the
ballot
during
the
2002
midterms
to
"
run
on
the
war
.
"
The
invasion
of
Iraq
provided
marvelous
political
cover
for
the
GOP
not
only
during
those
midterms
,
but
during
the
2004
Presidential
election
.
What
kind
of
political
cover
would
be
gained
from
an
attack
on
Iran
,
and
from
the
diversion
of
attention
to
that
attack
?
The
answer
lies
in
one
now
-
familiar
name
:
Jack
Abramoff
.
The
Abramoff
scandal
threatens
to
subsume
all
the
hard
-
fought
GOP
gains
in
Congress
,
and
the
2006
midterms
are
less
than
a
year
away
.
Is
any
of
this
a
probability
?
Logic
says
no
,
but
logic
seldom
plays
any
part
in
modern
American
politics
.
All
arguments
that
the
Bush
administration
would
be
insane
to
attack
Iran
and
risk
a
global
conflagration
for
the
sake
of
political
cover
run
into
one
unavoidable
truth
.
They
did
it
once
already
in
Iraq
.

I
came
here
about
12
years
ago
for
college
.....
and
Orla
got
it
spot
on
,
I
have
n't
left
,
nor
would
I
.
It
s
now
my
home
.
My
myTouch
4G
crashes
with
most
custom
ROMs
I
install
.
Can
that
be
fixed
?
I
really
like
the
MIUI
,
but
a
process
crashes
repeatedly
about
every
3
seconds
.
And
I
ca
n't
even
load
the
newest
version
of
Cyanogen
Mod
.
not
by
the
company
...
as
you
voided
your
warrenty
by
installing
custom
roms
you
are
best
to
either
recover
to
the
standard
ROM
,
or
find
one
that
does
n't
crash
.
cynangon
mod
should
work
.
Have
you
tried
using
clockwork
recovery
?
Get
the
older
version
of
Cynagon
mod
.
Also
you
could
use
a
stable
rom
like
bugless
beast
and
baked
snake
.
Those
roms
focus
on
speed
and
stability
.
Or
you
could
just
use
a
home
screen
launcher
replacement
.
I
would
recommend
go
launcher
or
adw
launcher
.
They
are
both
excellent
and
speed
up
the
phone
quite
a
bit
.
As
a
mytouch
4g
owner
I
know
the
phone
is
pretty
fast
and
their
is
no
point
installing
a
rom
.
Hope
you
read
through
this

are
the
moors
and
penines
in
Yorkshire
a
lonely
eerie
place
?
and
how
big
are
they
?
i
m
33
.
i
ve
never
been
to
the
yorkshire
moors
or
penines
at
all
...
i
can
see
the
penines
in
the
far
distance
from
my
bedroom
window
.
when
i
watched
werewolf
in
london
(
great
film
)
that
was
the
only
time
i
saw
the
yorkshire
moors
.
can
anyone
give
me
information
about
them
?
They
can
be
bleak
and
eerie
,
often
very
exposed
,
often
covered
with
antiquities
like
bronze
age
burial
mounds
,
stone
circles
and
settlements
--
until
late
in
the
bronze
age
they
were
rich
farmlands
,
then
a
change
in
the
climate
caused
the
skies
to
cloud
over
and
rain
to
wash
the
goodness
from
the
soil
.
The
people
abandoned
their
farms
and
religious
sites
and
the
ground
they
stood
on
became
moorland
.
They
can
also
be
very
beautiful
when
the
purple
heather
is
out
,
and
they
are
habitat
to
much
wildlife
and
many
species
of
wildflowers
.
I
have
a
western
pleasure
appy
that
s
really
heavy
on
her
left
lead
at
the
lope
?
My
appy
is
very
heavy
on
her
left
lead
at
the
lope
.
She
seems
to
lope
one
stride
and
trot
the
next
and
repeat
...
How
could
I
work
with
her
to
get
off
her
four
hand
,
get
balance
,
and
lope
smoothly
and
slowly
??
Put
on
a
pair
of
spurs
and
before
she
makes
that
trot
step
,
it
's
in
the
feeling
when
you
feel
her
think
trot
,
tick
her
with
the
spur
and
lift
with
your
body
to
keep
her
moving
.
If
you
concentrate
on
that
feel
just
before
the
trot
you
can
figure
it
out
and
the
timing
is
essential
to
push
her
at
that
instant
.
Lope
her
to
the
left
in
circles
,
keep
her
head
to
the
inside
of
the
circle
and
push
her
but
out
,
keep
doing
this
if
she
breaks
to
a
jog
go
a
little
bit
bigger
circle
,
till
she
can
get
enough
balance
to
go
small
and
small

Olympus

14
Megapixel
Digital
Camera
has
filters
and
can
do
all
sorts
of
special
effects
.
It
is
def
worth
more
than
the
price
.
I
am
VERY
satisfied
.
A
good

dead
pixel
of
my
photos
?
just
want
to
ask
..
i
have
an
nikon
dslr
..
i
m
wondering
why
if
i
zoom
my
picture
zoom
like
almost
200
-
300
percent
..
i
can
see
some
dead
pixel
...
is
there
something
wrong
with
my
camera
body
?
lens
?
or
what
?
please
help
me
..
and
what
should
i
do
to
fix
this
problem
?
or
it
is
normal
?
Are
you
sure
it
is
n't
dirt
on
the
sensor
?
Put
the
camera
on
manual
focus
and
set
focus
to
infinity
Take
a
photo
of
a
very
light
plain
subject
close
to
the
lens
using
long
exposure
and
smallest
aperture
you
have
-
over
expose
by
a
couple
of
stops
You
will
see
in
the
image
if
there
is
dirt
as
that
will
be
the
only
thing
in
focus
Cure
is
to
get
the
sensor
cleaned
There
should
be
a
Pixel
Mapping
function
in
the
menu
that
will
get
rid
of
them
,
most
sensors
have
a
few
dead
and
flipped
pixels
,
some
only
show
up
on
long
exposures
.
Chris
New
Zealand
skilled
migrant
visa
?
If
you
apply
for
a
skilled
migrant
worker
s
visa
and
it
is
accepted
do
you
have
to
find
work
in
the
same
sector
as
your
skills
on
your
application
or
can
you
take
up
other
work
if
you
ca
n't
find
something
in
your
own
field
.
I
have
posted
this
question
on
the
NZ
visa
site
and
ca
n't
get
any
info
,
does
anyone
know
.???
Watch
out
the
poles
are
coming
.....
my
little
butterfly
That
would
be
preferable
but
it
does
n't
matter
,
could
be
something
similar
It
depends
on
the
conditions
of
your
skilled
migrant
visa
.
Your
visa
should
say
whether
or
not
you
are
restricted
to
work
in
a
specific
sector
.
If
your
visa
does
not
restrict
you
from
taking
any
work
in
New
Zealand
then
you
can
work
in
any
sector
.
It
only
matters
if
you
received
an
offer
of
employment
or
if
you
are
currently
working
in
New
Zealand
and
used
that
job
in
your
application
to
get
your
skilled
migrant
visa
.
In
Chicago
,
what
is
the
best
restaurant
to
dine
at
on
a
budget
?
Downtown
Chicago
,
Loop
,
North
Take
the
red
line
to
Clark
,
then
you
turn
right
.
Walk
2
blocks
then
turn
right
again
.
Walk
2
more
blocks
then
cross
the
street
.
You
will
get
to
a
place
called
"
BIG
BOWL
"
.
THAI
FOOD
AND
ASIAN
.
BEST
PLACE
EVER
!!!!!!!!!!!!
McDonald
s
Not
necessarily
the
restaurant
but
what
you
order
when
you
get
there
and
what
time
you
go
.
A
lunch
will
be
less
expensive
than
a
dinner
.
You
can
order
appetizers
rather
than
a
full
meal
and
have
just
as
good
a
dinner
.
But
the
best
way
is
to
use
coupons
.
Check
out
http://www.restaurant.com
lots
of
restaurants
you
can
look
at
the
menu
and
check
out
prices
.
Yo
also
may
want
to
try
"
small
neighborhood
"
restaurants
and
support
family
run
places
rather
than
the
large
corporate
chains
.
Not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that
because
they
also
employ
local
people
that
live
and
shop
in
the
area
.
Is
there
any
cure
for
mouse
poison
?
I
found
a
poor
little
mouse
walking
around
in
my
friend
s
house
,
and
since
I
was
able
to
catch
it
very
easily
(
normally
mice
move
at
the
speed
of
light
)
,
and
since
it
was
acting
unresponsive
,
I
thought
it
was
infected
with
mouse
poison
,
since
my
friend
uses
it
.
I
know
that
the
mouse
will
probably
die
,
but
I
was
wondering
if
there
is
any
cure
for
mouse
poison
?
I
just
hate
to
see
the
poor
dears
experience
a
slow
painful
death
that
way
:(
.
Without
knowing
the
exact
poison
,
no
.
A
common
one
is
arsenic
and
there
really
is
n't
a
way
to
cure
that
.
Take
the
mouse
to
an
emergency
vet
and
have
them
use
CO2
to
put
the
mouse
to
sleep
.
Or
,
you
can
put
the
animal
in
a
snap
trap
designed
for
rats
or
mice
since
that
is
the
only
really
humane
kill
method
for
invasive
animals
.
A
quick
cure
would
be
Arm
&
Hammer
to
it's
head
.
Crayola
Air
-
Dry
Clay
?
Ok
.
So
I
have
a
VERY
long
list
of
people
I
want
to
make
Xmas
gifts
for
and
one
of
them
is
my
best
friend
.
She
loves
giraffes
and
homemade
things
!
I
am
very
artistic
so
I
decided
I
was
going
to
make
her
a
giraffe
sculpture
.
I
do
n't
have
much
money
so
I
bought
Crayola
Air
-
Dry
Clay
.
I
have
sculpted
the
giraffe
laying
down
.
The
key
is
...
I
have
a
few
problems
:
1
.
I
tested
it
out
by
making
a
figure
boat
And
after
4
days
when
it
dried
it
was
very
fragile
!
(
like
VERY
not
in
a
good
way
)
Is
there
any
way
to
strengthen
it
?
2
.
What
kind
of
paint
do
I
use
to
paint
the
giraffe
?
3
.
Is
there
any
cheap
way
to
give
it
a
shine
like
I
made
it
in
a
kiln
?
air
dry
clay
works
on
armatures
,
the
clay
has
a
minor
shrink
percent
,
so
you
can
leave
the
wire
armature
inside
,
paint
with
acrylic
paint
taking
young
cat
with
me
for
a
week
out
of
state
?
good
idea
?
i
have
a
3
-
4
month
old
kitten
and
i
live
in
forida
.
i
am
going
to
my
grandma
s
in
north
carolina
and
we
are
going
camping
in
a
cabin
in
west
virginia
.
My
cat
is
a
outside
cat
but
she
loves
it
inside
.
she
is
also
good
in
a
carrier
.
Should
i
bring
her
?
if
so
how
quick
will
she
adapt
to
a
litter
box
inside
?
thanks
We
took
our
cat
Mitten
camping
.
He
loved
it
.
But
he
was
an
inside
/
outside
cat
(
only
one
I
owned
-
rest
have
been
100
0nside
cats
)
.
He
was
trained
to
a
harness
/
leash
for
outside
time
but
he
knew
to
use
the
litter
pan
inside
.
If
your
cat
is
not
trained
to
use
the
litter
pan
,
you
may
have
a
problem
taking
her
.
NO
!
changing
its
surroundings
too
often
will
stress
it
out
and
it
will
get
depressed
,
mean
,
sick
,
or
will
not
want
to
be
around
you
.
What
cleaners
should
I
use
for
dusting
around
my
parakeet
?
What
cleaners
can
I
use
to
dust
around
my
budgie
.
Would
pledge
be
ok
?
If
not
,
what
is
?
Your
best
bet
would
just
be
a
swiffer
duster
--
they
do
n't
require
cleaner
.
If
you
must
use
a
cleaner
,
pledge
should
be
fine
if
the
area
that
you
keep
your
parakeet
in
is
well
ventilated
.
I
have
had
parakeets
for
a
VERY
long
time
,
and
I
use
pledge
.
Just
keep
a
window
open
for
a
while
for
fresh
air
to
circulate
.
I
agree
w
the
answer
from
Nothing
.
Even
a
cotton
cloth
(
I
like
diapers
)
that
is
barely
damp
w
water
will
work
fine
.
Swiffer
or
any
type
of
micro-fiber
cloth
is
excellent
.
I
use
Miracle
Cloth
,
they
're
fantastic
,
just
do
n't
use
fabric
softener
or
dryer
sheets
when
cleaning
them
,
it
ruins
their
"
grabbing
"
ability
.

If
anything

use

Yes
obviously
the
USB
is
region
free
which
means
you
can
use
it
anywhere
.
And
every
computer
manufactured
in
both
Ireland
&
the
UK
are
Region
2
aka
PAL
.
There
wo
n't
be
a
difference
since
mobile
broadband
is
supposed
to
be
digital
.
But
word
of
advice
if
you
're
get
your
girlfriend
a
laptop
make
sure
it
s
a
good
brand
a
not
something
like
DELL
,
Acer
,
Asus
,
eMachines
etc
.
just
a
heads
up
.
yes
of
course
you
can
....
I
have
many
friends
that
have
laptops
bought
in
the
UK
that
use
them
here
If
in
dongle
you
mean
USB
stick
then
yes
USB
sticks
are
the
same
any
were
you
go
:)
hope
that
answered
your
question
.
How
do
I
take
care
of
my
newborn
baby
fish
?
I
am
nervous
that
my
other
fish
will
eat
them
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
to
feed
them
!
I
have
counted
around
25
of
them
and
they
currently
reside
in
a
20
gallon
tank
.
You
could
move
all
the
babies
into
a
fry
net
breeder
or
move
all
of
the
bigger
fish
(
also
the
parents
)
to
a
different
tank
to
avoid
the
babies
getting
eaten
.
Feed
the
babies
3
-
4
times
a
day
with
flakes
.
Provide
plenty
of
hiding
places
like
rocks
,
plants
,
etc
in
the
tank
.
It
s
natural
for
some
babies
to
be
eaten
by
adults
and
if
all
of
them
survived
your
tank
would
be
very
overcrowded
.
Look
in
the
pet
stores
for
"
fry
food
"
or
"
baby
fish
foods
"
.
what
kind
of
newborn
fish
you
have
?
some
parents
would
not

bearded
dragon
spikes
?
bit
of
a
stupid
question
but
do
the
spikes
/
spines
(
whatever
you
call
them
)
on
their
side
and
face
area
ever
go
hard
.
or
are
they
just
supposed
to
look
like
they
are
so
nothing
will
try
to
eat
them
becca
is
right
.
i
v
owned
beardies
for
ovr
3
yrs
and
i
handle
mine
all
the
time
..
they
do
nt
go
hard
lik
eneedle
hard
but
they
ar
nt
pillow
soft
.
they
use
them
to
look
prickly
..
would
you
try
to
eat
a
cactus
[
if
u
had
no
knife
]
i
know
i
would
nt
.
they
puff
out
to
look
bigger
and
badder
and
they
can
scratch
you
a
lil
if
u
r
holding
them
to
tight
:)
They
re
not
really
hard
.
Beardies
are
actually
quite
delicate
.
I
'm
assuming
it
's
to
scare
off
predators
/
like
how
they
will
puff
up
their
neck
spikes
to
make
them
look
bigger
to
predators
or
enemies
.
they
do
nt
hurt
unless
you
r
stupid
enough
to
press
on
them
.
They
just
are
there
as
an
adaptation
.
what
is
a
kimberwick
bit
used
for
?
Used
as
a
help
for
horses
that
are
quite
strong
pullers
while
hacking
,
hunting
and
doing
cross
country
.
It
is
a
curb
bit
with
a
ported
mouth
piece
and
some
horses
appreciate
this
to
give
them
more
room
in
their
mouths
for
their
tongues
.
It
is
not
as
precise
as
a
pelham
bit
because
it
only
uses
one
rein
,
though
the
modern
ones
have
two
or
three
slots
on
which
to
put
the
reins
.
The
lower
the
reins
,
the
stronger
the
action
and
the
lower
the
reins
the
stronger
the
action
on
the
poll
too
.
Useful
for
younger
kids
who
do
not
have
big
enough
hands
or
the
ability
to
handle
two
reins
independently
.
For
horses
that
are
strong
pullers
.
It
just
gives
you
a
little
leverage
and
curb
pressure
.
It
's
nice
for
horses
that
need
a
little
more
than
a
snaffle
.
I
know
that
's
vague
,
but
it
depends
on
the
horse
.
The
rider
needs
to
have
independent
hands
as
well
,
because
you
do
NOT
want
to
pull
too
hard
on
a
bit
like
that
.

How

Hey
,
Be
happy
you
get
a
bit
,
many
of
us
never
got
nothing
:)
There
's
a
Canon
EOS
T2i
,
with
the
exact
same
sensor
,
just
no
articulating
screen
.
It
's
around
$
100
less
,
which
means
you
get
the
same
camera
but
quicker
!

's
a
DSLR
Buying
Guide
-
http://www.the-dslr-photographer.com/2009/11/which-dslr-to-buy/
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
If
you
ca
n't
even
do
basic
math
,
you
'll
never
figure
out
how
to
use
a
DSLR
camera
properly

hey
kido
u
made
me
smile
does
the
POP
drying
time
slow
down
if
it
not
exposed
to
air
?
it
s
for
a
craft
project
.....
i
want
to
use
it
the
way
u
would
use
icing
....
took
a
bit
of
searching
to
discover
that
POP
is
probably
PoP
-
plaster
of
Paris
and
yes
plaster
of
Paris
will
slow
way
down
if
it
is
not
exposed
to
air
-
in
fact
,
if
you
are
building
up
plaster
(
"
the
way
you
would
icing
"
)
to
do
sculpting
,
which
is
rather
uncommon
,
you
keep
the
set
plaster
damp
in
order
to
add
more
unset
plaster
or
you
have
to
wet
the
area
where
you
will
be
adding
plaster
"
mud
"
Plaster
of
Paris
does
two
things
-
it
chemically
sets
-
gets
warm
to
hot
then
cools
down
and
hard
and
-
it
dries
out
,
losing
the
water
that
is
soaked
into
the
set
structure
For
example
,
a
set
plaster
mold
that
is
to
be
used
for
clay
slip
casting
must
be
dry
-
it
gets
wet
pulling
the
water
out
of
the
slip
-
while
a
set
plaster
mold
used
for
molding
wax
must
be
soaking
or
damp
wet

Dwarf
Hamster
Making
Too
Much
Noise
On
Wheel
at
Night
?
I
'm
getting
a
dwarf
Hamster
tomorrow
And
i
was
just
talking
to
my
Mom
and
she
said
that
we
have
to
take
out
the
wheel
at
night
because
it
would
disturb
her
sleep
But
i
told
her
no
because
i
said
thei
r
energetic
at
night
at
my
room
is
right
next
door
to
hers
But
i
heard
their
are
wheels
that
do
nt
make
noise
at
all
what
would
be
the
price
of
it
?
I
'm
quite
sure
,
you
do
n't
even
have
to
buy
another
,
all
you
need
to
do
,
is
to
pour
some
oil
on
the
wheel
,
or
even
put
some
rubber
on
it's
edges
,
the
part
that
is
making
the
noise
.
That
might
work

Pet
Silent
Spinner

!
works
well
lasts
long
.
I
have
a
dwarf
hamster
who
HATES
his
wheel
and
does
n't
use
it
-
he
makes
so
much
MORE
noise
,
as
he
plays
and
digs
and
jumps
(
seriously
)
wheels
are
relatively
noiseless
-
a
few
squeaks
from
a
wheel
are
better
than
the
full
wrath
of
a
bored
pet
!
Change
of
boarding
station
?
How
can
I
change
my
boarding
station
against
the
ticket
I
booked
a
month
back
from
counter
?
My
origin
Station
is
Howrah
,
but
I
want
to
board
at
Asansol
..
Does
your
train
pass
Asansol
when
starting
from
Howrah
?
If
yes
,
you
do
n't
need
to
change
it
because
you
board
later
.
If
no
,
you
'll
have
to
go
to
one
of
the
train
stations
.
In
Calcutta
there
is
a
Foreigner
's
reservation
office
where
they
speak
English
very
well
.
I
do
n't
remember
near
which
station
it
is
though
.
They
can
help
you
and
it
is
close
to
a
train
station
in
Calcutta
so
check
a
few
big
ones
?
Even
if
you
do
n't
find
the
foreigner
's
office
you
'll
be
fine
in
the
normal
Reservation
Office
of
any
big
train
station
.
This
is
where
you
can
get
AND
change
express
train
tickets
.
well
if
your
desired
boarding
station
comes
after
more
than
2
or
3
halts
of
the
actual
boarding
point
,
then
the
TC
will
cancel
you
ticket
and
allot
the
seat
to
others
.
so
better
inquire
in
railway
office
Contact
the
Indian
railways
.
You
might
end
up
as
a
no
show
passenger
.

Canadian
student
visa
,
can
I
used
for
other
schools
?
I
applied
to
get
a
student
visa
to
study
in
Canada
,
I
received
one
that
is
valid
until
October
of
2015
.
Problem
is
,
for
some
reason
,
the
visa
process
took
longer
than
it
should
,
thus
I
missed
school
this
semester
(
visa
was
issued
to
me
about
25
days
after
school
started
so
I
could
n't
attend
)
,
now
I
no
longer
want
to
go
into
that
school
(
because
they
only
would
accept
me
again
on
September
of
2012
)
,
I
found
a
school
that
accepted
me
for
may
2012
,
can
I
use
the
same
visa
that
was
issued
to
me
?
or
do
I
need
to
reapply
?
(
in
the
visa
itself
,
it
does
not
mention
anything
about
which
school
I
m
suppose
to
attend
,
and
problem
is
,
the
embassy
here
in
DC
are
not
too
nice
and
would
never
answer
ANY
questions
....

any
advice
please

How
Do
you
Prevent
A
Dwarf
Hamster
Escaping
From
The
Cage
?
I
m
getting
a
dwarf
hamster
tomorrow
and
i
saw
videos
on
youtube
of
them
escaping
and
if
my
hamster
escaped
because
my
mom
will
FREAK
OUT
!!!
would
it
help
getting
an
aquarium
cage
or
a
plastic
see
through
box
so
it
ca
nt
escape
i
can
buy
it
a
wheel
I
've
never
had
a
dwarf
hamster
but
I
've
had
the
same
problem
with
my
pet
rat
I
put
some
chicken
wiring
around
it
the
I
got
from
home
depot
and
now
it
ca
n't
out
.
Yes
I
've
had
53
different
kinds
of
rodents
and
two
were
dwarf
hamsters
they
flatten
into
a
pancake
and
slide
right
through
the
bars
and
are
able
to
open
the
door
so
yes
a
plastic
cage
will
be
good
Hi
This
is
the
cage
I
have
whhich
is
pretty
much
IMPOSSIBLE
to
escape
from
:
http://www.petsathome.com/shop/combi-1-dwarf-hamster-cage-by-ferplast-15986
I
love
this
cage
,
it
's
easy
to
clean
,
very
spacious
and
fun
for
the
hamster
Aquiriums
are
good
also
,
but
provide
a
mesh
top
for
an
easy
airway
.
Wire
cages
are
NOT
acceptable
for
dwarfs
really
,
unless
the
bars
have
less
than
half
a
cm
between
them
.

For
the

and

?
I
am
17
years
old
.
I
do
not
get
along
with
my
family
.
I
dislike
this
urban
society
and
want
to
leave
this
whole
enviroment
.
I
am
very
unhappy
here
.
I
do
n't
know
the
best
way
of
doing
it
.
Would
it
be
best
for
me
to
finish
college
?
wait
for
18th
birthday
?
I
live
in
London
.
I
want
to
go
travelling
.
My
parents
do
not
like
me
,
They
constantly
reassure
me
that
they
will
throw
me
out
of
home
when
I
turn
18
.
I
do
n't
particularly
want
to
stay
with
them
atm
either
.
But
right
now
it
s
the
most
convenient
thing
to
do
.
Anyway
Advice
for
travelling
.
What
is
the
best
way
of
doing
it
?
Hotels
for
travelling
will
be
expensive
.
anybody
is
open
to
answers
but
I
would
much
prefere
somebody
with
traveling
experience
.
I
want
to
go
all
over
:)
I
do
n't
have
a
set
route
yet
.
Get
a
back
pack
and
sleeping
bag
or
good
warm
blanket
.
Wool
is
best
.
Light
,
warm
,
but
also
itchy
.
Hit
the
road
.
You
can
always
beg
for
spare
change
when
you
get
hungry
.
Should
get
some
survival
skills
before
setting

on
your
own

Vietnamese
girl
's
name
,
Mayko
?
I
always
thought
Mayko
or
Meiko
is
a
Japanese
name
.
The
Canadian
Regenesis
actress
Mayko
Nguyen
has
Japanese
connection
or
is
it
her
fake
name
?
Right
,
I
could
n't
find
any
proven
source
for
that
.
And
her
last
name
,
Nguyen
is
a
typical
Vietnamese
family
name
...
anyone
?
Certainly
,
Nguyen
is
the
one
of
first
names
of
many
people
in
Vietnam
,
only
in
Vietnam
.
Mayko
is
relating
to
the
Japanese
.
In
Vietnam
,
when
a
baby
was
born
,
they
must
be
named
"
first
name
"
according
to
that
of
their
fathers
.
It
's
principle
except
a
number
of
cases
,
for
example
,
the
babies
are
orphans
or
not
to
have
father
.
E.g
.
Full
name
of
the
father
is
:
"
Nguyen
Thanh
Luan
"
===>
Full
name
of
the
son
/
daughter
certainly
is
"
Nguyen
..........
"
,
for
instance
,
"
Nguyen
Thi
Thuy
Lan
"
.
But
if
the
babies
were
born
in
American
so
they
would
named
in
other
way
but
still
remain
"
First
name
"
in
order
to
recall
about
their
origination
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
that
Mayko
is
Japanese
.
She
is
a
Canadian
born
Vietnamese
.
I
'm
not
sure
where
her
first
name
is
from
...
I
have
a

the
phones
and
the
filter
,
I
'm
still
getting
a
buzzing
noise
even
when
I
have
disconnected
the
other
phone
without
one
.
Why
is
it
stil
doing
this
even
though
I
do
n't
have
the
other
phone
connected
?
Woud
it
be
better
if
I
got
another
filter
and
connected
the
other
phone
as
well
?
turn
the
modem
off
and
see
if
the
sound
is
still
there
...
could
be
static
on
the
line
...
if
the
sound
is
still
there
with
the
modem
off
then
the
problem
is
NOT
the
DSL
....
if
the
trouble
goes
away
with
the
modem
off
,
then
make
sure
that
EVERYTHING
EXCEPT
the
modem
is
filtered
,
this
would
include
the
alarm
system
,
fax
machine
,
satellite
boxes
,
phones
,
etc
...
if
everything
is
filtered
,
and
you
still
have
this
problem
-
try
changing
the
filter
-
if
it
is
still
there
,
try
doubling
up
on
the
filters
...
You
need
either
a
filter
for
each
device
except
the
DSL
modem
,
or
a
whole
home
filter
which
filters
all
the
jacks
,
except
the

Best
way
to
change
35
mm
film
in
Holga
120
whilst
out
and
about
?
I
've
modified
my
Holga
120
to
take
35
mm
film
and
I
know
that
you
ca
n't
wind
the
film
back
,
you
have
to
open
the
back
of
the
camera
(
in
a
darkroom
)
to
rewind
the
film
.
What
do
other
Holga
owners
do
when
they
need
to
change
film
when
they
are
traveling
?
Do
you
just
take
a
changing
bag
with
you
?
What
s
the
easiest
thing
?
Well
a
changing
bag
would
be
the
easiest
solution
.
It
's
light
proof
and
makes
sure
you
get
no
problems
when
opening
the
camera
.
You
can
work
comfortably
and
make
sure
your
film
is
not
scratched
etc
.
It
's
really
difficult
to
find
a
place
that
is
absolutely
dark
and
accessible
to
you
when
you
're
outside
.
A
changing
bag
folds
neatly
and
does
not
take
much
space
in
your
bag
.
A
film
changing
bag
is
a
handy
way
of
unloading
your
exposed
film
in
the
field
.
Many
online
stores
carry
them
,

Should
the
statue
of
David
be
censored
?
I
'm
a
sophomore
in
high
school
doing
a
presentation
on
Italian
Arts
and
my
teacher
is
making
us
censor
the
Statue
of
David
.
My
argument
is
it
's
art
and
therefore
should
not
be
censored
he
's
making
us
censor
it
who
's
right
no
,
it
's
only
a
body
of
a
young
man
the
city
of
florence
did
at
one
time
in
the
past
put
clothes
on
the
statue
An
art
teacher
in
the

metro
got
fired
because
she
took
an

class
on
an
approved
field
trip
with
parental
permission
for
each
student
and
some
hysterical
parent
discovered
that
they
saw
"
nudes
"
in
the
museum
.
You
do
n't
think
is
was
because
of
female
nudes
considering
the
nearly
naked
girls
/
women
seen
at
pools
and
beaches
and
the
completely
naked
manikins
that
show
up
in
store

in

No
,
it
was
guys
.
Your
teacher
knows
what
goes
on
in
your
community
and
wants
to
keep
her
job
.
Let
her
do
it
-
argue
when
you
are
of
age
and
can
battle
the
other
adults
in
your
community
-
skipping
of
course
telling
your
boss
he
/
she
is
a
prudish
ignoramus
because
you
want
to
keep

job

Better
Steakhouse
in
Philadelphia
?
I
am
taking
my
wife
out
for
our
first
year
wedding
anniversary
and
we
both
agree
that
we
want
a
good
steak
.
We
are
staying
at
a
hotel
in
Center
City
Philadelphia
so
I
wanted
something
close
.
I
have
spent
the
afternoon
looking
around
from
menu
to
menu
...
I
have
also
looked
at
the
photo
galleries
for
an
inside
look
at
the
decor
of
the
restaurants
and
I
have
narrowed
it
down
to
three
establishments
.
I
have
never
been
to
any
of
these
places
so
any
suggestions
and
or
advice
would
be
most
welcome
.
It
's
narrowed
down
to
Butcher
and
Singer
,
Davio
's
,
and
Del
Frisco
s
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
the
advice

HAMSTERS
-
will
a
hamster
be
ok
living
in
the
bathroom
?
in
his
cage
in
the
bathroom
?
or
would
the
steam
from
the
shower
be
a
problem
?
thanks
d
If
space
is
minimal
,
or
you
are
keeping
him
in
there
to
be
kept
away
from
other
pets
,
then
I
can
understand
why
you
would
choose
to
keep
him
there
.
There
are
some
things
to
consider
though
...
Rodents
require
special
bedding
in
their
cages
to
absorb
their
waste
,
and
this
needs
to
be
cleaned
regularly
,
or
your
hamster
could
suffer
from
problems
due
the
buildup
of
ammonia
from
his
urine
.
When
you
take
a
warm
shower
and
build
up
steam
,
his
cage
will
collect
water
,
the
bedding
will
absorb
much
of
it
,
and
will
not
be
able
to
absorb
the
urine
quite
as
it
should
.
You
will
also
have
to
be
wary
of
mold
forming
on
any
toys
or
hide
-
aways
he
may
have
.
You
also
do
n't
want
it
getting
too
warm
for
him
too
often
.
Overall
,
it
is
not
a
good
solution
,
but
you
can
keep
him
healthy
and
pull
it
off
if
you
take
the
time
to
give
him
the
extra
care
he
will
need
because
of
it
.
It
may
be
a
problem
because
the
temperature
is
constantly
changing
.
I
would
personally
put
him
somewhere
else
.

I

you

It

I

)
what
do
I

I
found
this
pure

in

its

is
injured

so
I
'm
currently
taking

It
's
pure

no
marks

or
anything
,
I
do
n't
know
what
type
of
bird
it
is
,
probably
a
dove
?
What
should
I
feed
it
?
Is
normal
bird
food
fine
?
(
Because
apparently
my
mom
is
very
picky
,
she
says
the
bird
might
get
sick
if
it
does
n't

IS
there
any

I

cheapest
plastic
surgeons
in
Thailand
?
I
want
to
go
to
thailand
to
do
my
boob
job
from
South
Africa
but
looking
for
the
cheapest
surgeons
yet
also
good
in
his
artwork
on
a
human
s
body
.
Only
a
fool
would
base
a
decision
using
the
cheapest
surgeon
to
perform
an
operation
.
Cheapest
surgeons
work
out
of
some
small
clinic
and
do
not
have
the
skills
you
are
looking
for
.
.
Do
you
really
want
to
put
your
faith
in
some
clinic
doctor
.
I
know
I
would
n't
.
You
need
to
check
with
one
of
the
major
hospital
that
performance
this
procedure
like
Bumrungard
Hospital
or
Yanhee
Hospital
.
Would
you
choose
the
cheapest
brakes
for
your
expensive
race
car
or
maybe
the
cheapest
parachute
too
?
Sometimes
the
"
cheap
"
comes
expensive
!
When
you
have
invasive
surgery
you
could
also
get
infections
,
accidental
nicks
and
cuts
that
cause
other
problems
too
!
If
they
screw
up
you
could
be
in
worse
shape
than
you
are
now
!
Bumrungrad
Hospital
does
some
good
work
but
all
hospitals
do
have
their
problems
from
time
to
time
.
Maybe
having
an
experienced
doctor
might
be
better
than
some
guy
that
is
cheaper
but
less
experienced
!

my
Tom
cat
will
not
eat
meat
just
the
juice
in
the
can
.?
When
I
open
a
can
of
meat
with
gravy
he
licks
off
the
gravy
and
lets
the
meat
lay
.
I
must
through
it
away
.
Why
?
If
you
knew
what
kind
of
"
meat
"
they
put
in
canned
cat
food
you
'd
understand
this
.
I
've
had
a
lot
of
cats
who
refused
to
eat
the
canned
food
.
When
you
read
the
label
it
s
easy
to
understand
why
.
I
've
had
cats
for
35
years
and
I
only
feed
them
dry
food
.
They
have
done
very
well
and
like
the
dry
food
better
.
It
had
better
nutritional
value
and
it
s
also
less
expensive
.
Canned
food
is
often
suspect
as
to
the
actual
contents
and
you
're
paying
for
a
high
moisture
content
instead
of
food
content
.
There
are
a
lot
of
good
quality
dry
cat
foods
.
Read
the
labels
for
contents
.
Your
cat
will
adjust
quickly
.
You
'll
also
have
less
spoilage
.

chicken
liver
(
cooked
)
for
the
anemic
one
,
some
arthritis
stuff
for
the
oldest
.
Even
if
you
mash
it
with
a
spoon
he
ca
n't
do
that

What
s
your
favorite
part
about
trail
riding
?
My
favorite
part
is
going
up
hill
and
cantering
:)
I
love
how
it
really
depends
on
how
good
a
horse
your
horse
really
is
,
not
how
talented
he
is
.
If
you
took
some
Olympic
-
level
horses
on
a
trail
ride
,
they
just
could
n't
do
it
.
They
would
be
too
scared
and
spooky
.
It
does
n't
matter
how
graceful
your
horse
is
,
or
how
high
he
can
jump
,
or
how
well
he
does
a
sliding
stop
.
What
matters
is
how
well
trained
he
is
,
and
how
good
your
bond
it
.
That
is
another
reason
why
I
like
competitive
trail
riding
also
.
Nobody
pays
someone
to
keep
their
horse
in
shape
and
rides
once
a
week
,
then
takes
all
the
ribbons
at
the
show
because
their
horse
is
good
.
YOU
have
to
spend
the
time
training
.
And
I
have
not
met
one
stuck
-
up
trail
rider
!
Those
are
just
a
few
reasons
why
I
love
trail
riding
,
competitive
or
not
.
Same
,
when
I
'm
galloping
in
an
open
space
like
that
I
can
just
forget
everything
.
Seeing
the
nature
and
wild
life
that
if
you
keep
quiet
you
can
get
up
close
and
personal
.
I
have
had
several
close
encounters
with
both
foxes
and
wild
deer
.
Also
woodpeckers
were
pecking
in
the
trees
and
I
just
sat
and
watched
.
Fascinating
.
10
gallon
nano
reef
ideas
?
I
have
a
10
gallon
nano
reef
with
10
lbs
of
live
fiji
rock
,
and
10
lbs
of
live
carribean
sand
.
I
am
aware
of
the
maintenance
involved
in
keeping
a
tank
this
size
.
I
am
currently
maintaining
a
gravity
level
of
1.024
.
I
have
a
10
gallon
filter
on
it
.
I
also
have
a
powerhead
,
getting
another
soon
.
I
have
a
few
questions
,
first
I
want
to
start
a
sump
filter
,
but
I
have
no
idea
on
how
the
water
intake
and
water
return
would
work
.
How
would
I
need
to
set
a
sump
for
this
10
gallon
?
Do
I
need
a
protein
skimmer
or
any
other
equipment
?
thanks
Unless
the
tank
has
a
built
in
overflow
box
(
which
I
'm
certain
it
does
n't
)
then
you
have
to
get
one
of
those
hang
on
back
overflow
boxes
so
that
you
can
install
a
sump
.
The
piping
would
lead
down
into
your
sump
from
the
overflow
box
.
On
the
other
end
of
the
sump
,
you
would
have
a
small
return
pump
with
a
hose
that
puts
the
water
back
into
your
tank
.
If
you
're
going
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
creating
a
sump
for
this
tank
,
getting
a
protein
skimmer
would
n't
be
a
bad
idea
.
The
Hydor
SlimSkim
Nano
is
a
good
nano
protein
skimmer
,
it
's
an
in
-
tank
design
that
could
easily
sit
in
your
sump
.
NOOK
Color
or
NOOK
Tablet
?
From
what
I
understand
they
're
pretty
much
the
same
thing
.
Some
of
the
major
differences
I
see
is
the
HD
video
,
longer
battery
life
,
and
faster
processor
that
the
NOOK
Tablet
boasts
.
Does
the
Tablet
have
a
major
difference
in
speed
compared
to
the
Color
?
I
do
n't
want
an
iPad
or
Kindle
.
I
just
want
an
e-reader
that
does
a
little
bit
more
than
just
read
.
Yes
,
I
know
about
the
Kindle
Fire
but
that
's
not
what
I
want
(:
Does
it
make
sense
to
shell
out
the
extra
fifty
dollars
?
Or
just
purchase
the
Color
?
Well
I
recently
bought
the
Nook
Color
,
and
I
have
to
say
that
I
am
very
happy
with
it
.
It
is
like
a
mini
tablet
itself
!
When
I
found
out
them
came
up
with
the
Nook
Tablet
,
I
was
pretty
disappointed
though
,
because
I
bought
my
Nook
color
for
the
same
darn
price
!
So
I
say
you
should
go
for
the
more
updated
Nook
Tablet
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
it
'll
be
worth
it
.
Have
fun
!
Judging
by
Nook
Tablet
's
processor
it
's
supposed
to
be
quite
faster
!
Basically
Nook
Tablet
it
has
more
memory
,
better
battery
life
and
a
better
processor
and
a
microphone
.

Pubs

Philadelphia
?
Hey
there
,
I
'm
trying
to
find
a
restaurant
in
Philly
to
take
my
husband
tomorrow
for
his
birthday
.
He
's
pretty
much
an
"
I
love
American
Food
,
good
drinks
on
occasion
,
laid
back
.
"
kind
of
guy
.
;)
I
want
to
take
him
somewhere
where
there
's
going
to
be
awesome
burgers
/
american
food
,
atmosphere
(
preferably
a
tavern
/
pub
style
would
be
nice
)
,
good
service
,
and
all
around
a
great
time
.
=)
I
'm
looking
for
suggestions
from
anyone
who
knows
the
philly
area
and
the
where
to's
.
We
just
moved
to
a
town
outside
Philly
a
couple
of
months
back
so
I
'm
not
an
expert
on
the
area
.
A
little
help
is
always
great
.
=)
Thank
you
or
your
feed
back
.
Oh
my
,
you
asked
this
question
at
the
perfect
time
.
Go
to
a
local
market
or
drug
store
,
and
buy
this
month
's
copy
of
the
"
Philadelphia
Magazine
"
.
It
is
all
about
this
very
subject
...
bars
and
food
.
It
lists
places
all
over
the
city
and
suburbs
.
Wishing
your
husband
a
happy
birthday
!
If
you
're
looking
for
a
good
burger
,
some
great
fries
(
they
are
too
die
for
!
)
,
and
good
drinks
,
go
to
Chickie
&
Pete
's
!
Oh
my
gosh
,
they
are
great
!
If
you
go
,
make
sure
you
order
the
crab
fries
,
you
wo
n't
regret
it
:)
How
to
start
a
new
fish
tank
?
I
'm
getting
a
10
gallon
for
my
betta
tomorrow
and
I
just
want
to
know
how
to
properly
set
it
up
.
I
'm
still
a
beginner
.
Any
and
all
suggestions
on
what
I
need
to
do
and
buy
will
help
.
Thanks
.
When
you
get
the
tank
make
sure
you
wash
the
inside
(
with
plain
water
)
then
you
wash
the
gravel
(
with
only
water
too
)
take
out
all
the
stuff
that
is
floating
on
top
.
Add
only
silk
plants
as
plastic
ones
may
tear
up
ur
betta
s
delicate
fins
.
You
add
the
water
and
put
water
conditioner
into
the
water
.
Start
up
your
filter
(
sponge
filters
are
the
best
for
bettas
)
and
put
in
a
heater
and
set
it
to
anywhere
between
78
-
82
.
Wait
about
2
weeks
or
3
and
test
your
water
.
If
everything
is
looking
good
you
may
add
you
betta
to
its
new
home
.
Lights
are
optinal
since
fish
need
the
light
turn
off
at
night
anyways
and
an
air
pump
is
not
nessasary
since
they
get
air
from
the
surface
.
ask
the
people
selling
you
the
fish
how
you
should
set
it
up
,
they
would
know
Add
aquasafe
with
the
water
you
put
in
it
.
Make
sure
the
temperature
is
good
.
Do
not
put
your
fish
tank
close
to
the
sun
or
algae
grow
in
your
tank
.
Everything
else
should
be
good
.
Make
sure
if
you
get
new
fish
that
they
get
along
with
one
another
.
Is
it
possible
to
shoot
lazers
out
of
your
Wang
?
I
would
like
to
learn
how
I
see
you
re
still
recovering
from
the
accident
.
You
appear
to
be
feeling
better
though
.
That
's
good
.

Know
that
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
laser
sights
before
you
mount
them
on
your
wang
.
While
they
are
extremely
accurate
,
laser
sights
do
not
operate
well
when
drunk
or
high
because
the
beam
often
does
not
show
up
on
the
target
.
Therefore
,
you
must
learn
to
shoot
manually
.
2
Mount
laser
sights
on
away
by
removing
the
hand
grip
.
Laser
grips
are
the
most
common
for
wangs
.
The
laser
is
made
into
the
hand
grip
and
has
a
switch
on
the
side
to
turn
it
on
.
Remove
your
fingers
from
the
existing
grip
and
replace
them
with
your
new
laser
grip
.
You
have
two
adjustment
screws
for
up
and
down
and
right
to
left
positions
.
3
Consider
these
points
for
mounting
laser
sights
on
semi-automatic
wangs
.
Newer
semi-automatic
wangs
have
a
rail
built
into
the
receiver
under
the
shaft
.
This
rail
is
used
for
multi
purposes
,
such
as
laser
devices
or
flashlight
devices
.
4
Prepare
to
mount
the
laser
sight
onto
the
rail
on
the
wang
.
You
have
two
screws
that
attach
the
sight
to
the
wang
.
Tighten
these
screws
securely
.
Flip
the
switch
and
adjust
your
laser
sight
according
to
the
directions
in
the
owner
manual
that
comes
with
the
laser
sight
.
3
weeks
old
baby
budgie
alone
at
night
?
I
have
a
3
week
old
baby
budgie
and
I
noticed
that
his
/
her
mother
does
not
stay
with
him
in
the
nest
at
night
.
I
have
to
mention
that
i
recently
separated
the
father
into
another
cage
close
to
the
'
nest
cage
'
because
he
and
the
mother
were
fighting
.
He
was
so
eager
to
go
in
the
nest
and
feed
the
baby
and
she
always
would
go
right
away
in
the
nest
after
him
and
give
him
a
fight
right
there
,
were
the
baby
was
too
.
I
thought
it
was
dangerous
for
the
baby
so
I
moved
him
.
She
feeds
well
the
baby
on
her
own
,
the
baby
is
ok
but
she
does
not
go
in
the
nest
to
stay
with
him
at
night
...
What
is
the
problem
?
Is
this
a
transitional
period
for
the
baby
...
that
he
/
she
is
left
alone
much
more
time
?
I
have
to
say
that
the
baby
does
not
scream
after
her
of
anything
...
he
/
she
sleeps
.
Budgies
are
breast
feeding
birds
and
it
may
be
the
male
is
bisexual
.
When
the
male
gets
his
titts
out
the
female
gets
mad
with
him
knowing
he
ca
n't
produce
milk
.
It
's
fine
-
just
make
sure
that
the
room
the
cage
is
in
is
kept
warm
.
If
the
baby
is
feathered
yet
-
which
I
'm
sure
he
is
mostly
-
he
should
be
fine
.
Just
remember
to
make
sure
the
mother
is
properly
caring
for
the
baby
.
Ignore
the
answer
above
me
,
btw
!
^^
Can
I
text
from
Canada
to
the
united
states
?
Ok
maybe
that
is
n't
the
right
question
,
but
my
question
is
can
you
text
from
a
united
states
number
when
you
r
in
canada
,
can
you
send
texts
to
another
united
states
number
?
And
do
you
get
charged
for
it
?
I
m
sorry
if
I
could
n't
say
the
question
right
.
I
hope
somebody
understands
what
I
mean
In
short
Yes
.
However
not
in
all
cases
.
If
your
(
US
)
provider
has
a
deal
with
a
canadian
wireless
company
,
you
texts
and
calls
will
go
through
.
They
will
,
however
,
cost
a
bunch
.
The
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
call
611
,
or
your
cell
phone
help
line
,
and
ask
.
The
phones
and
networks
are
compatible
,
so
the
only
reason
it
would
n't
work
would
be
if
you
have
,
say
,
a
cheap
cell
phone
company
..
Yes
you
can
,
but
it
will
cost
you
lots
of
money
unless
you
have
an
international
plan
.
Ye$
you
can
Text
in
CANADA
to
the
U$
on
a
U$
number
.
Thi$
$ervice
will
co$t
.
It
varie$
company
to

.
You
may
want
to
get
a
temporary
phone
for
your
trip
to
Canada
.
Is
there
any
other
way
to
communicate
or
do
your
friends
only
understand
text
.
Email
usually
free
if
you
use
a
WiFi
connection
.
$ometime$
it
is

to
explain
that
you

CHILL
OUT
!
Firstly
,
your
hammie
was
not
stressed
out
,
he
wanted
attention
.
Secondly
,
that
is
normal
behavior
as
they
use
the
wheels
in
the
night
.
Thirdly
,
just
put
your
hand
in
his
cge
ans
leave
it
their
.
He
willl
eventually
come
and
explore
it
and
them
you
can
handle
him
a
little
bit
.
Hope
I
helped
!
Give
him
time
.
You
only
got
him
yesterday
.
He
's
probably
still
scared
and
unsure
.
Once
he
has
properly
settled
down
,
got
use
to
the
new
smells
and
noises
he
will
be
fine
.
Once
he
is
more
comfy
with
his
surroundings
,
then
you
can
start
handling
him
and
getting
to
know
each
other
more
.
But
just
give
him
time
for
now
.
Is
Fujairah
a
nice
place
to
live
in
?
My
family
and
I
are
planning
to
shift
to
Fujairah
in
a
couple
of
years
.
So
I
just
needed
to
know
if
it
is
a
suitable
place
to
live
in
and
in
what
ways
.
Also
that
,
I
heard
in
the
next
few
years
Fujairah
would
be
as
good
as
Dubai
,
is
it
true
?
I
'd
be
happy
if
someone
helps
,
especially
someone
who
has
been
to
Fujairah
or
lives
there
.
:)
I
LIVE
THERE
!
...
I
ve
been
living
in
Fujairah
my
entire
life
and
I
must
say
that
it
is
developing
in
a
good
way
.
I
think
2012
is
going
to
be
a
great
year
for
Fujairah
as
we
have
A
LOT
of
projects
to
be
done
by
2012
.
Things
to
do
in
Fujairah
..
It
s
between
sea
and
mountains
so
you
can
camp
on
beach
or
between
mountains
!
...
Fishing
,
Jet
skies
,
snorkeling
,
diving
are
some
of
the
things
you
can
do
for
fun
.
And
now
they
are
finishing
a
road
between
Fujairah
and
Dubai
in
45
minutes
only
!
So
,
no
it
is
not
as
good
as
Dubai
,
but
it
s
quieter
and
more
peaceful
,
and
you
can
still
go
to
Dubai
in
45
mins
.
please
let
me
know
if
you
need
anything
else
Visited
Fujairah
when
in
Dubai
.
Nothing
like
Dubai
,
and
never
will
be
!
Do
n't
know
the
economics
of
Fujairah
but
Dubai
is
basically
bankrupt
so
you
would
n't
want
to
end
up
like
them
!
Unless
you
have
a
particular
skill
they
need
-
and
firm
job
offer
before
going
-
I
would
think
twice
about
it
!
Are
there
any
new
Gaming
console
?
I
do
n't
know
should
i
buy
PS3
or
X
-
BOX
Kinect
.
Or
even
N
-
DS
or
PSP
.
I
'm
a
little
afraid
when
i
buy
PS3
or
X
-
BOX
then
a
newer
version
comes
out
.
(
Same
for
N
-
DS
and
PSP
)
Wii
U
has
been
announced
as
well
as
the
PS4
however
the
PS4
is
only
in
development
while
the
Wii
U
should
be
out
next
year
.
Microsoft
has
not
announced
there
new
console
yet
though
it
is
believed
to
be
in
the
works
.
No
matter
when
you
buy
you
will
get
a
newer
version
.
I
feel
X
-
BOX
is
a
very
smooth
system
i
own
it
like
3
years
,
it
s
very
compatible
to
previous
versions
and
mostly
important
i
was
very
comfortable
with
the
User
Interface
and
the
JOYSTICK
....
coz
you
do
nt
wan
a
hold
a
joystick
that
gives
you
discomfort
.
XBOX
Joys
are
soo
comfyy
.....
Performance
-
You
get
the
same
in
all
,
just
get
a
good
TV
.
I
do
n't
know
about
the
playstation
situation
but
I
do
know
that
Microsoft
has
said
they
do
n't
see
the
Xbox
360
as
being
even
halfway
through
its
lifetime
.
Since
they
released
kinect
this
was
kind
of
their
way
of
releasing
a
new
Xbox
so
they
do
n't
plan
on
making
another
one
for
a
while
.
I
do
know
they
have
already
announced
a
new
wii
though
and
I
do
n't
know
what
Sony
has
said
about
playstation
but
again
,
if
you
get
an
Xbox
(
which
I
personally
think
is
the
best
anyways
)
you
should
be
set
for
a
while
.
What
is
the
typical
lifespan
of
a
cat
?
My
cat
had
a
seizure
yesterday
and
was
ill
.
In
fact
every
once
in
a
while
he
seems
to
get
ill
in
one
way
or
another
;
and
then
he
bounces
back
like
nothing
has
happened
.
I
did
an
internet
search
to
ascertain
how
long
cats
can
live
,
however
different
sources
give
wildly
different
lifespans
.
My
cat
is
18
years
old
.
In
your
experience
how
long
do
cats
do
cats
typically
live
?
Is
he
on
his
last
legs
or
is
it
conceivable
that
he
could
be
around
for
another
15
years
as
is
claimed
by
some
of
the
sources
i
ve
been
looking
at
?
from
my
experience
with
my
cats
13
-
18
years
depending
on
the
breed
.
At
18
years
,
your
cat
has
had
a
long
life
.
Indoor
cats
that
are
well
cared
for
typically
live
11
-
15
years
.
Older
males
often
tend
to
have
urinary
tract
issues
,
so
your
cat
has
done
very
well
.
Male
cats
very
seldom
live
past
14
-
15
years
.
Stories
of
cats
living
more
than
25
years
are
rare
.
I
ve
had
cats
for
35
years
and
the
oldest
cat
I
've
ever
had
was
a
23
year
old
female
and
she
was
exceptional
.
By
comparison
,
outdoor
cats
have
a
life
expectancy
of
3
-
7
years
depending
on
how
many
predators
are
in
the
local
environment
.
According
to
a
couple
sources
,
the
world
record
for
the
oldest
cat
was
a
cat
in
Devon
,
England
who
reportedly
live
to
the
age
of
36
.
I
knew
a
cat
that
died
in
its
sleep
aged
21
.
Anything
after
12
is
a
bonus
.
Gaining
and
loosing
my
cockatiel
's
trust
...
?
I
thought
that
I
had
gained
my
cockatiel
's
trust
,
but
now
he
's
not
coming
to
me
when
I
open
his
cage
.
What
do
I
do
?
Did
anything
happen
before
losing
his
trust
?
Birds
are
hard
to
gain
trust
with
,
but
it
's
lost
so
easily
!
A
simple
hand
gesture
could
have
resorted
to
him
being
afraid
of
you
.
Eating
by
his
cage
and
keeping
a
"
sleep
cage
"
in
your
room
is
a
good
idea
.
Birds
eat
and
sleep
with
their
flock
,
not
predators
.
Keep
his
cage
open
and
go
on
your
computer
,
or
read
a
book
,
etc
and
maybe
he
will
come
out
to
you
.
Let
him
go
at
his
own
pace
,
do
n't
rush
with
him
,
and
never
ever
resort
to
physical
violence
with
your
bird
.
This
with
ruin
your
bond
,
and
you
probably
wo
n't
have
another
chance
to
build
one
.
Patience
is
the
key
.
=)
he
might
never
be
a
cuddly
,
loving
,
tame
bird
,
but
you
can
still
have
a
friendly
bond
.
But
then
again
he
could
be
!
dat
bird
is
smart
.
like
my
dogs
,
they
really
like
me
and
trust
me
,
but
when
I
open
the
door
to
get
them
outside
,
they
run
from
me
,
they
know
I
'm
going
to
take
them
outside
and
they
do
n't
like
it
.
the
bird
must
know
that
when
you
open
the
cage
door
it
means
that
you
will
put
him
in
the
cage
,
and
birds
do
n't
usually
like
cages
.
so
,
I
do
n't
think
the
bird
do
n't
trust
you
,
but
still
do
n't
like
the
cage
.

How
can
i
get
my
kitten
to
stop
biting
when
he
plays
?
I
have
a
kitten
who
just
turned
3
months
today
.
He
's
a
good
kitty
,
just
when
he
plays
he
bites
REALLY
hard
.
Almost
every
day
he
'd
even
wake
me
up
like
5
am
in
the
morning
,
trying
to
bite
my
arm
.
And
when
I
move
it
I
guess
he
figures
I
'm
playing
.
x.x
I
read
somewhere
that
you
have
to
hold
his
mouth
together
,
and
keep
it
that
way
til
he
panics
.
That
seems
cruel
to
me
though
.
Any
other
way
??
Do
you
think
he
's
teething
?
It
's
getting
out
of
hand
.
Yeah
,
I
thought
that
the
holding
his
mouth
thing
sounded
wrong
.
No
worries
,
i
did
n't
try
.
He
does
have
toys
,
a
scratching
post
,
LOTS
of
mice
,
balls
,
yarn
,
a
feathery
birdy
toy
,
etc
.
He
'd
just
randomly
walk
up
to
you
and
start
the
biting
.
When
i
put
him
off
of
my
bed
,
he
jumps
back
on
and
same
thing
.
he
may
be
teething
but
i
do
nt
think
it
can
be
stopped
.
maybe
buy
him
toys
that
he
can
play
with
that
give
him
a
way
to
use
his
energy
up
yes
do
not
hold
any
animal
s
mouth
shut
it
wil
close
their
air
way
,
he
s
just
a
kitty
and
they
are
very
rambunctious
,
get
him
toys
.
lots
of
them
,
feather
ones
work
best
,
also
when
he
bites
you
in
the
morning
put
him
down
off
your
bed
,
to
show
him
that
you
will
not
tolerate
that
,
he
will
get
it
,
he
s
also
probably
teething
,
so
toys
are
your
best
bet
Which
rat
cage
is
better
?
Hi
,
I
want
to
get
a
few
pet
rats
and
need
a
rat
cage
.
(
Apart
from
the
wire
flooring
which
i
am
going
to
cover
)
Which
of
these
two
cages
is
better
:
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht2079wt893
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/130589513308?var=430034792128&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648#ht1500wt660
I
ca
nt
decide
between
height
or
width
.
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht
This
one
is
better
for
rats
.
You
always
want
to
go
higher
rather
than
wider
for
rats
.
They
LOVE
to
climb
.
You
will
have
to
cover
the
wire
flooring
like
you
said
,
and
make
fleece
covers
for
the
stairs
,
so
no
ratty
feet
get
caught
and
broken
.
This
cage
will
hold
about
2
-
3
rats
.
Both
are
equal
length
so
go
for
the
taller
one
.
If
you
use
this
cage
it
's
best
to
remove
the
wire
shelves
altogether
and
replace
it
with
hammocks
and
the
like
.
I
used
one
of
these
cages
short
term
for
a
pet
and
it
was
n't
that
great
to
be
honest
,
pretty
cheaply
made
,
the
door
springs
are
annoying
and
it
does
n't
last
very
well
.
Here
are
some
better
options
IMO
:
http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/mamble-hamster-narrow-100cm-cage-p-12642.html
http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/abode-large-metal-cage-liberta-free-delivery-p-6679.html
http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/savic-freddy-cage-free-delivery-p-6750.html
http://www.netpetshop.co.uk/p-19500-savic-chichi-2-chinchilla-rat-degu-ferret-cage.aspx
http://www.justcages.co.uk/ferret-cages/ferplast-furet-plus-ferret-cage#v431
These
are
all
a
bit
more
expensive
than
your
choice
but
if
you
ebay
search
the
names
you
may
be
able
to
find
one
second
hand
...
better
paying
for
a
second
hand
one
in
good
condition
than
a
poorly
made
new
one
IMO
.
The
First
One
Is
much
Better
!
I
Have
This
Exact
Cage
,
Bought
From
The
Exact
Ebay
User
.
It
s
Really
Good
And
The
Rat
Calculater
Says
Is
Big
Enough
For
5
Rats
,
But
I
Would
Put
A
Maximum
Of
4
In
It
Really
:)
is
under
tank
heating
or
side
tank
heating
better
for
a
corn
snake
?
i
was
reading
the
package
for
a
tank
heater
i
bought
for
my
40
gallon
tank
for
my
snake
and
it
said
it
can
be
put
under
the
tank
or
on
the
side
.
i
m
not
worried
about
damaging
the
surface
my
tank
is
on
because
i
can
prop
it
up
off
the
surface
anyway
.
from
my
understanding
,
if
it
s
heated
from
the
bottom
,
my
snake
risks
burning
its
belly
if
it
burrows
and
rests
directly
on
top
of
the
glass
over
the
heater
unless
i
buy
some
of
that
reptile
carpet
to
put
under
the
substrate
,
but
it
has
better
heat
distribution
if
it
s
from
the
side
i
do
nt
have
to
worry
about
propping
it
up
,
but
the
snake
can
still
burn
itself
if
it
slithers
along
the
side
of
the
tank
and
i
also
read
that
it
does
nt
distribute
heat
as
well
?
what
are
your
suggestions
and
opinons
?
i
use
UTH's
on
all
of
my
burrowing
snakes
.
they
will
move
if
they
get
too
warm
-
it
's
not
like
a
heat
rock
which
you
should
avoid
at
all
costs
.
i
usually
put
my
own
natural
rock
over
the
UTH
and
they
are
perfectly
fine
.
i
have
over
40
corns
,
kings
,
and
milks
and
have
never
had
a
problem
with
the
UTH
system
.
on
the
side
is
a
waste
-
leave
it
on
the
bottom
.
good
luck
!
Bottom
if
you
are
worried
about
the
snake
burning
itself
put
something
overt
it
like
newspaper
...
I
now
use
a
75
watt
basking
or
heat
bulb
for
mine
and
he
seems
to
like
it
put
the
heater
on
the
snake
he
will
love
it
and
the
the
next
day
you
will
have
dinner

Question
about
the
sinking
of
the
Titanic
?
After
the
sinking
of
the
Titanic
in
1912
,
was
there
a
law
made
so
that
ships
would
carry
enough
lifeboats
to
save
everybody
on
a
ship
if
it
was
sinking
?
If
yes
,
was
Canada
involved
in
this
act
/
law
?
Sorry
,
I
'm
just
very
nervous
after
watching
the
movie
.
SOLAS
(
Safety
Of
Life
At
Sea
)
,
which
is
an
international
maritime
treaty
,
came
about
in
response
to
the
tragedy
of
the
Titanic
.
Today
,
it
is
the
primary
safety
law
affecting
virtually
all
ships
,
regardless
of
country
of
registration
.
If
you
ever
go
on
a
cruise
ship
,
you
will
be
required
to
attend
a
SOLAS
muster
drill
(
lifeboat
drill
)
within
24
hours
of
sailing
.
Most
ships
perform
this
drill
before
even
leaving
the
dock
.
SOLAS
covers
just
about
every
aspect
of
safety
at
sea
,
including
minimum
safety
equipment
,
practices
,
and
standards
,
lifeboats
,
navigation
practices
,
fire
protection
,
and
so
on
.
We
are
much
safer
today
on
board
ship
due
to
SOLAS
,
and
I
suppose
if
any
good
came
out
of
the
Titanic
tragedy
,
the
adoption
of
SOLAS
is
probably
it
.

--------------------------------------------------
Edit
:
Also
I
forgot
to
mention
earlier
,
most
(
if
not
all
)
cruise
ships
also
practice
lifeboat
drills
weekly
,
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
them
to
actually
launch
the
lifeboats
into
the
water
as
part
of
their
drill
when
you
are
in
port
.
This
not
only
ensures
the
lifeboats
are
operational
and
will
work
if
needed
,
but
makes
the
crew
proficient
at
launching
them
.
I
do
n't
think
so
Do
n't
worry
.
When
was
the
last
time
you
heard
about
a
ship
sinking
?
100
years
ago
?
What
are
some
fun
things
I
could
do
while
in
Japan
?
I
'll
be
in
Okinawa
for
about
a
week
so
I
was
wondering
what
are
some
fun
things
I
could
do
?
I
'm
a
20
year
old
female
travelling
by
myself
so
it
could
be
anything
.
Besides
the
obvious
tourist
spots
which
I
already
have
planned
for
.
How
is
the
night
life
in
Naha
?
Are
there
any
good
venues
that
showcase
underground
bands
,
or
just
a
venue
at
all
?
It
does
n't
have
to
be
underground
it
could
be
any
type
of
music
.
Thanks
The
best
thing
you
can
do
in
Okinawa
is
to
go
to
a
beach
.
Otherwise
,
you
can
do
what
you
can
do
in
other
parts
or
Japan
,
like
shopping
,
eating
,
etc
.
Or
you
can
visit
temples
or
shrines
in
Okinawa
.
Well
first
you
can
try
speaking
Japanese
.
Go
to
a
sumo
tournament
.
Eat
at
a
conveyor
-
belt
sushi
restaurant
.
Climb
Mount
Fuji
.
Okinawa
is
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
Japan
,
although
of
course
there
are
similarities
.
The
main
thing
people
do
there
is
go
to
the
beach
.
There
's
the
market
in
Naha
,
which
is
great
.
You
can
find
all
sorts
of
fresh
food
and
get
a
really
delicious
,
fresh
sashimi
/
sushi
lunch
upstairs
.
Try
the
local
sake
too
if
you
can
.
It
's
a
special
kind
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
there
's
much
nightlife
in
Naha
.
It
's
more
of
a
place
to
go
to
enjoy
the
weather
,
the
sea
,
etc
.
You
might
have
to
make
your
own
nightlife
by
finding
an
izakaya
(
pub
)
somewhere
.
Your
best
bet
would
probably
be
to
get
a
copy
of
the
Lonely
Planet
Japan
book
and
read
the
chapter
on
Okinawa
.
Naha
's
not
a
very
big
city
.
Modern
m
16
vs
Vietnam
m
16
version
?
I
was
playing
a
video
game
that
has
a
m
16
Vietnam
model
,
and
in
the
game
it
's
3
-
shot
burst
.
My
brother
said
they
only
had
full
-
auto
and
semiautomatic
during
Vietnam
.
My
questions
are
..
1
)
what
the
s
difference
between
a
modern
m16
and
Vietnam
m
16
?
2
)
did
Vietnam
m
16's
have
a
3
-
shot
burst
function
?
To
save
money
Robert
McNamara
ordered
that
the
ammunition
for
the
new
M
-
16s
being
sent
to
SEA
in
the
early
60s
use
an
older
(
dirtier
)
type
of
gunpowder
meant
for
use
with
the
M
-
14
.
He
also
ordered
that
the
receiver
not
get
a
(
I
think
chrome
)
coating
that
helped
keep
the
gun
from
jamming
.
Than
the
troops
being
issued
the
weapon
were
told
it
was
self
-
cleaning
,
which
it
was
n't
.
As
a
result
there
was
a
problem
with
the
weapon
jamming
.
Once
the
troops
started
cleaning
the
weapon
properly
(
even
with
the
dirtier
powder
)
the
Vietnam
era
M
-
16
turned
out
to
be
a
good
weapon
for
the
purpose
it
was
being
used
for
.
The
screw
-
up
was
the
kind
of
things
you
have
happen
when
you
have
bean
-
counters
(
and
McNamara
was
nothing
if
not
a
bean
-
counter
)
instead
of
soldiers
in
charge
of
the
military
.
Today
's
weapons
do
not
have
that
kind
of
problem
,
and
are
much
more
reliable
.
1
)
modern
m
16
is
alright
.
Vietnam
m
16
used
to
clog
up
and
never
work
.
2
)
All
M
16's
are
either
automatic
or
semi
automatic
.
No
one
uses
3
burst
.
you
play
too
much
cod
;P
modern
m

is
best
Planning
on
going
to
New
Zealand
in
January
.
Is
it
OK
to
holiday
in
Christchurch
since
the
Earthquakes
?
Are
the
hotels
back
up
and
running
?
Are
there
still
aftershocks
?
Planning
on
going
to
North
and
South
Island
.
Is
it
safe
to
go
to
Rotarua
,
since
the
earthquakes
?
Rotorua
is
fine
.
I
'm
assuming
this
was
in
reference
to
the
January
earthquake
,
do
n't
worry
,
it
was
very
deep
,
so
nothing
was
effected
:)
As
for
Christchurch
,
yes
the
aftershocks
are
still
happening
,
but
these
are
fairly
small
-
you
can
feel
them
,
but
the
do
n't
do
any
damage
.
Since
lots
of
people
are
still
living
there
,
then
it
must
be
fine
to
visit
.
However
the
CBD
is
closed
of
to
the
public
as
a
lot
of
it
is
still
rubble
and
stuff
and
has
n't
been
cleared
away
yet
.
I
'm
sure
that
you
can
find
some
hotels
that
are
running
in
the
christchurch
area
,
but
if
not
then
there
would
be
some
in
close
by
towns
.
Despite
the
aftershocks
I
would
recommend
going
to
Christchurch
,
just
for
the
experience
and
then
you
can
see
first
hand
how
things
get
effected
by
earthquakes
.
Have
fun
in
New
Zealand
!!
(
ps.
I
'm
assuming
you
'll
stop
off
in
Wellington
,
and
since
it
s
summer
,
may
I
recommend
kaffee
eis
ice
creams
and
gelatos
?
Just
recently
discovered
them
last
time
I
was
down
there
,
they
're
very
nice
)
www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
Loads
of
places
have
geographical
hazards
,
if
you
are
constantly
paranoid
,
you
'll
never
get
anywhere
without
a
sense
of
adventure
.
In
case
of
an
earthquake
,
stay
under
a
sturdy
table
and
do
n't
go
outside
as
possible
debris
will
fall
.
Yes
it
's
ok
.
Yes
,
yes
and
yes
.
Nothing
wrong
with
rotorua
Help

What
size
horse
do
i
need
?
I
m
around
5
'
2
-
5
'
4
,
11
years
old
and
i
m
wondering
what
size
horse
i
'll
need
that
i
wo
nt
grow
out
of
quickly
?
thanks
louise
I
would
say
it
really
depends
on
your
riding
ability
,
what
disciplines
you
are
interested
in
doing
,
or
plan
on
doing
,
etc
.
But
I
would
go
for
the
base
number
of
15
hh
.
It
's
"
tall
"
being
it
's
bigger
than
a
pony
,
but
it
's
on
the
small
end
for
a
horse
.
I
got
my
horse
when
I
was
12
and
I
was
already
5
'
9
-
5
'
10
,
thankfully
I
stopped
growing
when
I
hit
5
'
11
"
but
my
horse
is
about
16.2
or
16.3
hh
,
TB
.
So
do
n't
be
afraid
to
get
something
a
little
bigger
than
"
perfect
"
just
in
case
you
hit
a
growth
spurt
.
A
taller
horse
does
n't
always
mean
a
horse
you
ca
n't
handle
.
Keep
that
in
mind
.
Also
keep
in
mind
whether
you
want
to
be
able
to
jump
up
from
the
ground
,
if
you
even
need
to
,
etc
.
You
just
want
to
be
sure
you
can
groom
and
saddle
sufficiently
and
the
horse
itself
is
calm
enough
so
that
whatever
size
it
is
,
you
can
handle
it
.
i
'm
5
'
3
-
4
"
and
am
21
well
will
be
in
Nov
and
my
horse
is
14.2
hh
and
she
's
perfect
size
for
me
i
can
hop
right
on
with
no
mounting
block
.....
only
with
a
saddle
though
haha
i
ca
n't
bareback
,
not
yet
If
you
Do
n't
want
to
grow
out
of
it
quickly
get
a
14
'
2
..
Anything
smaller
you
will
grow
out
,
anything
bigger
will
be
too
big
and
difficult
to
control
and
manage
,
especially
when
riding
.
Hope
I
helped
:)
Where
in
the
world
is
Iguazu
?
Iguazu
Falls
Widely
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
spectacular
waterfalls
in
the
world
,
the
Iguazu
Falls
on
the
border
of
Argentina
and
Brazil
,
are
a
certainly
must
see
attraction
in
the
area
.
The
centre
of
the
falls
is
known
locally
as
‘
Garganta
Del
Diablo
’
(
The
Devil
’s
Throat
)
,
where
the
huge
volume
of
water
sends
a
constant
mist
of
spray
into
the
air
.
With
the
sun
shinning
down
on
the
spray
,
creating
a
rainbow
in
the
foreground
,
this
is
the
perfect
place
to
get
that
trademark
Iguazu
Falls
photograph
.
However
,
save
some
of
your
shots
for
the
rest
of
the
falls
,
as
in
total
there
are
around
270
cascades
that
spread
out
over
nearly
2
miles
of
the
Iguazu
River
.
The
Iguazu
Falls
are
easily
accessible
and
,
dependent
on
your
time
restrictions
and
budget
,
you
can
get
to
the
area
by
either
bus
or
plane
.
The
nearest
towns
to
the
site
are
Puerto
Iguazu
in
Argentina
,
about
12
miles
from
the
falls
,
and
Foz
do
Iguaçu
in
Brazil
,
which
is
equally
close
.
Both
towns
have
airports
that
are
served
regularly
from
the
larger
cities
such
as
Sao
Paulo
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
and
Buenos
Aires
.
The
bus
is
obviously
the
cheaper
option
,
and
travelling
up
from
Buenos
Aires
the
trip
is
a
full
20
hours
,
although
the
buses
are
very
comfortable
with
spacious
reclining
seats
.
The
bus
trip
down
from
Sao
Paulo
is
a
similar
affair
taking
around
18
hours
.
Foz
on
the
Brazilian
side
is
the
larger
town
,
however
both
are
geared
up
to
cater
for
visitors
to
the
Waterfalls
and
National
Parks
,
and
so
offer
a
range
of
accommodation
for
all
budgets
.
For
those
with
a
larger
appetite
for
the
scenery
and
a
larger
budget
,
there
are
some
hotel
complexes
much
closer
to
the
action
with
views
of
parts
of
the
falls
.
Paris
or
England
while
studying
aboard
?
I
am
going
to
try
and
study
aboard
but
idk
where
I
can
go
I
can
not
decide
where
do
you
think
would
be
the
best
place
to
go
?
where
would
you
go
?
I
have
never
been
anywhere
out
side
my
home
town
Charlotte
north
Carolina
please
help
!!!!
definitely
London
-
you
speak
the
language
and
will
have
more
fun
.
The
French
tend
to
look
down
on
the
Americans
and
treat
them
bad
.
London
is
a
deliteful
city
to
visit
and
easy
to
get
around
.
You
will
be
able
to
have
a
good
time
there
.
%
As
you
're
from
the
States
you
'll
have
much
more
fun
in
London
.
Parisians
dislike
Americans
for
their
lack
of
speaking
French
and
proper
French
manners
.
I
was
told
to
leave
a
restaurant
because
I
ordered
water
with
my
meal
(
apparently
this
is
"
washing
down
"
your
food
"
)
and
not
ordering
wine
.
You
'll
need
to
have
intermediate
French
to
have
a
good
time
in
Paris
.
However
,
outside
Paris
everybody
is
wonderful
.
Nobody
likes
the
Parisians
,
even
then
Parisians
do
n't
like
Parisians
.
South
France
is
wonderful
,
right
on
the
Mediterranean
.
It
's
beautiful
and
the
people
are
extremely
friendly
.
I
used
to
live
in
London
for
6
months
and
it
's
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
be
in
the
world
(
I
've
been
to
45
countries
in
5
years
)
.
Everything
about
the
place
is
magical
and
the
people
are
mostly
friendly
.
However
,
if
you
're
allowed
another
option
and
you
want
a
small
-
town
feel
,
then
head
to
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
.
I
lived
there
for
8
months
.
If
your
French
is
good
/
moderate
,
then
head
to
Paris
without
a
doubt
.
I
also
highly
recommend
staying
with
a
French
family
.
I
did
this
at
age
13
in
Champagne
,
France
and
it
was
the
most
amazing
experice
of
my
upbringing
.

How
can
i
make
my
Jack
Dempsey
reproduce
?
i
have
a
Mature
male
and
female
they
are
together
a
lot
but
never
laid
eggs
as
far
as
i
know
can
anyone
help
me
figure
out
how
to
make
them
mate
He
's
the
issue
,
you
are
trying
to
"
Make
"
them
mate
.
This
is
like
trying
to
Make
2
people
get
married
.
It
does
n't
work
.
First
you
need
a
compatible
pair
.
Sounds
like
your
2
at
least
tolerate
each
other
,
so
there
is
hope
there
.
Then
the
need
to
be
mature
,
that
is
,
old
enough
,
and
big
enough
to
breed
.
This
may
be
around
1
/
2
of
their
full
adult
size
,
probably
4
-
5
"
for
those
guys
.
Then
the
environment
.
Large
tank
,
no
annoying
tankmates
,
perfect
water
conditons
and
really
good
feeding
.
The
difference
is
what
they
need
to
live
,
VS
what
's
ideal
for
them
.
Get
that
right
,
and
they
will
mate
when
THEY
are
ready
.
You
ca
n't
MAKE
them
mate
,
you
can
only
encourage
them
.
Ian
Jack
Dempseys
are
not
an
easy
cichlid
to
breed
.
Most
of
the
time
one
is
more
interested
in
breeding
than
the
other
.
Bredders
take
the
one
that
in
not
very
interested
and
put
it
alone
in
a
breeeding
tank
for
3
-
5
days
.
The
tank
should
have
a
hide
space
big
enough
for
one
fish
,
or
a
few
of
them
,
but
at
least
1
cave
big
enough
for
two
fish
to
fit
in
.
The
p
H
should
be
6.5
-
7
.
Now
feed
the
one
in
the
breeding
tank
as
much
bloodworms
,
blackworms
and
/
or
earthworms
as
it
can
eat
for
3
-
5
days
.
Then
add
the
other
mate
.
They
may
not
respond
right
away
and
they
may
fight
so
ther
smaller
one
can
fit
in
one
of
hide
spaces
if
it
gets
attacked
.
When
the
male
s
aggressive
behavior
stops
,
it
is
ready
to
spawn
.
The
two
lay
their
eggs
inside
the
cave
you
made
for
them
.
Turn
the
water
temp
up
to
82
degrees
Please
help
with
my
cat
s
bladder
issue
?
I
have
a
1
1
/
2
year
old
female
calico
.
When
she
was
spayed
the
vet
had
a
hard
time
because
she
only
has
one
uterine
horn
and
he
said
this
could
mean
she
only
has
on
kidney
.
Recently
she
has
been
peeing
A
LOT
.
I
'm
talking
soaking
all
the
litter
box
and
then
some
.
She
is
also
peeing
around
the
box
and
somehow
it
gets
underneath
.
I
do
n't
have
the
money
to
take
her
to
a
vet
right
now
but
it
's
getting
to
be
an
issue
.
I
have
to
scrub
the
floor
2
-
3
times
a
week
now
.
What
could
be
the
issue
and
can
I
try
some
home
remedies
first
?
I
love
her
and
want
to
help
her
but
I
do
n't
know
when
I
'll
be
able
to
take
her
to
to
vet
:(
please
help
.
First
of
all
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
hear
you
're
having
this
issue
with
your
cat
.
:(
Frequent
urination
is
a
sign
of
several
things
.
Bladder
or
Urinary
tract
infections
are
two
common
ones
,
but
these
usually
are
frequent
visits
,
with
small
amounts
of
urine
being
passed
.
If
there
is
blood
in
the
urine
,
or
the
cat
seems
to
be
in
pain
,
then
that
is
also
a
good
indicator
.
But
your
cat
is
passing
a
LOT
of
urine
,
and
this
is
bad
.
Given
the
chance
your
cat
may
only
have
one
kidney
,
I
would
think
the
worst
case
scenario
would
be
kidney
disease
,
which
untreated
can
lead
to
possible
renal
failure
.
Signs
of
this
can
be
hard
to
spot
,
and
if
this
is
true
in
her
case
she
will
definitely
need
to
see
a
vet
.
Vomiting
,
bad
breath
,
and
listlessness
.
Seizures
will
occur
when
the
toxins
that
the
kidney
normally
filters
out
are
released
into
the
blood
stream
.
I
know
you
are
very
worried
,
but
getting
her
to
the
vet
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
for
her
.
In
the
meantime
make
sure
she
had
plenty
of
water
available
to
her
.
I
want
to
apply
for
canada
skilled
immigeration
program

I
got
only
63
points
while
67

Can
i
apply
with
63
points
?
According

HOWEVER
...
that

also
states
that
"
The

The

The

And
between

the
time
I
applied
,
the
minimum

did
change
once
.
Unfortunately
,
both
minimums
were
above
my
score
.
But
I
got
lucky
because
I
qualified
under
another

So
keep
checking
at

on

you

Alright

(
I

wanted
me
to
see
one
of
those
chain
letter

)
so
I
fineally
checked
it
,
and
it
was
an
e

from
southwest

telling
me

Well

I
mean

to
be
mad
about
it
.
At
least
you
get
to
go
to
Florida
in
JANUARY
.
And
,
having
only
two
days
makes
you
realize
what
you
have
with
your
family
.
Nothing
Gold
Can
Stay
,
honey
.
Enjoy
it
while
you
can
,
and
then
if
your
family
enjoys
it
you
can
go
again
for
a
longer
period
of
time
.
If
they
do
n't
like
it
,
it
'll
only
be
two
days
,
remember
?
Hope
you

a
crapload

What
is
Italian
High
Renaissance
?
Have
a
look
at
this
,
it
may
help
.
1
)
The
Italian
Renaissance
began
the
opening
phase
of
the
Renaissance
,
a
period
of
great
cultural
change
and
achievement
in
Europe
that
spanned
the
period
from
the
end
of
the
13th
century
to
about
1600
,
marking
the
transition
between
Medieval
and
Early
Modern
Europe
.
The
term
renaissance
is
in
essence
a
modern
one
that
came
into
currency
in
the
19th
century
,
in
the
work
of
historians
such
as
Jacob
Burckhardt
.
Although
the
origins
of
a
movement
that
was
confined
largely
to
the
literate
culture
of
intellectual
endeavor
and
patronage
can
be
traced
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
14th
century
,
many
aspects
of
Italian
culture
and
society
remained
largely
Medieval
;
the
Renaissance
did
not
come
into
full
swing
until
the
end
of
the
century
.
The
word
renaissance
(
Rinascimento
in
Italian
)
means
“
rebirth
”
,
and
the
era
is
best
known
for
the
renewed
interest
in
the
culture
of
classical
antiquity
after
the
period
that
Renaissance
humanists
labelled
the
Dark
Ages
.
These
changes
,
while
significant
,
were
concentrated
in
the
elite
,
and
for
the
vast
majority
of
the
population
life
was
little
changed
from
the
Middle
Ages
.
2
)
The
expression
High
Renaissance
,
in
art
history
,
is
a
periodizing
convention
used
to
denote
the
apogee
of
the
visual
arts
in
the
Italian
Renaissance
.
The
High
Renaissance
period
is
traditionally
taken
to
begin
in
the
1490s
,
with
Leonardo
s
fresco
of
the
Last
Supper
in
Milan
and
the
death
of
Lorenzo
de'
Medici
in
Florence
,
and
to
have
ended
in
1527
with
the
sacking
of
Rome
by
the
troops
of
Charles
V
.
This
term
was
first
used
in
German
(
Hochrenaissance
)
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
,
and
has
its
origins
in
the
"
High
Style
"
of
painting
and
sculpture
described
by
Johann
Joachim
Winckelmann
.
[
1
]
Over
the
last
twenty
years
,
use
of
the
term
has
been
frequently
criticized
by
academic
art
historians
for
over-simplifying
artistic
developments
,
ignoring
historical
context
,
and
focusing
only
on
a
few
iconic
works
.

Hope
it

I
'm
American
and
I
am
going
to
the
UK
for
the
first
time
,
what
should
I
expect
?
I
just
need
to
talk
to
an
another
american
who
has
gone
to
the
UK
before
so
that
I
know
what
expect
when
arriving
at
the
airport
and
with
going
through
visa
process
and
everything
.
do
you
get
your
visitor
s
visa
immediately
at
the
airport
?
I
was
told
that
americans
automatically
get
a
six
months
visitor
s
visa
.
do
you
have
to
go
through
a
medical
exam
right
away
?
drug
test
?
blood
test
?
or
do
i
just
show
them
passport
and
walk
through
the
gates
?
i
have
talked
to
some
people
that
say
that
a
medical
exam
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
and
other
say
it
s
a
routine
thing
when
entering
another
country
.
I
honestly
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
or
prepare
for
and
calling
in
to
get
professional
advice
from
either
of
the
embassies
costs
by
the
minute
-
which
I
really
do
n't
have
the
money
for
.
I
'm
really
worried
cause
I
have
no
idea
who
to
talk
to
and
want
everything
to
go
smoothly
.
An
American
passport
should
get
you
right
into
the
country
,
there
is
no
need
for
a
VISA
,
for
six
months
.
There
is
no
medical
exam
or
blood
test
or
others
like
that
.
You
do
not
need
to
call
the
embassies
to
get
professional
advice
.

Above
is
the
link
to
the
Department
of
State
travel
website
,
which
will
give
you
all
the
info
that
you
need
,
including
passport
information
.
It
is
free
.
I
never
stayed
more
than
two
weeks
at
a
time
when
I
visited
the
U.K
.
You
should
be
fine
with
just
a
passport
,
unless
you
're
staying
longer
than
six
months
.
You
should
double
check
with
the
necessary
embassy
before
you
leave
though
.
I
am
not
sure
how
well
you
planned
this
trip
.
You
'll
have
a
great
time
,
so
no
worries
there
.
I
visited
London
,
Edinburgh
,
and
St.
Andrew
s
so
far
,
and
I
was
treated
very
well
and
with
great
kindness
.
Just
treat
everyone
else
as
you
would
want
to
be
treated
,
and
you
'll
be
fine
.
That
tactic
never
failed
me
.
What
would
you
get
if
you
cross
a
sussex
male
and
a
silkie
female
?
i
had
a
sussex
male
and
a
pekin
female
i
bought
2
silkies
what
would
the
sussex
female
and
the
silkie
females
would
make
?
if
you
had
any
pics
of
your
hens
i
would
like
to
see
them
to
compare
them
to
mine
thanks
?
A
Sussex
crossed
with
Silkie
would
make
a
crossbred
*
mutt
*
chicken
.
There
are
a
lot
of
genetics
at
play
between
a
Sussex
and
Silkie
,
so
the
offspring
would
vary
in
appearance
.
You
do
n't
say
what
color
Silkie
or
Sussex
you
are
dealing
with
so
I
ca
n't
say
what
color
your
chicks
would
be
likely
to
be
.
However
,
I
can
say
what
features
they
would
/
could
have
.
Feather
Type
.
Silkies
have
hookless
feathers
.
Sussexs
have
soft
feathers
.
All
offspring
from
this
cross
will
have
soft
feathers
,
as
hookless
feathers
are
a
recessive
gene
.
Skin
Color
:
Silkies
have
black
skin
color
,
which
is
dominate
.
Sussex
have
White
Skin
which
could
be
recessive
or
dominate
.
Either
way
rec.
and
dom.
white
genes
dilute
the
black
gene
.
Skin
will
be
darker
but
lighter
then
the
Silkies
.
Beards
/
Muffs
:
If
your
Silkie
has
a
beard
/
muff
the
offspring
could
have
a
beard
as
well
,
as
these
genes
are
incomplete
dominate
.
Feathered
Feet
/
Shanks
-
Chicks
could
have
feathered
feet
/
shanks
as
this
is
also
incomplete
dominate
.
Crest
:
Chicks
could
also
develop
a
small
crest
due
to
this
being
another
incomplete
dominate
gene
.
Comb
Type
:
Silkies
have
walnut
combs
which
is
actually
genetically
two
comb
types
(
Rose
and
Pea
)
single
is
also
there
,
but
is
recessive
.
So
crossed
to
a
Sussex
you
could
get
a
walnut
,
pea
,
rose
,
or
single
combed
bird
.
Five
Toes
:
Silkies
have
five
toes
.
Sussex
have
four
toes
.
Crossed
together
(
five
toes
is
incompletely
dominate
)
chicks
could
develop
to
have
an
fifth
toe
on
both
,
or
even
one
foot
.
Silkie
crosses
are
great
birds
,
and
very
neat
looking
.
Hens
make
excellent
mothers
as
they
are
bigger
,
can
see
better
,
and
are
smarter
the
Silkies
.

What
do
you
think

The
lighting
was
not
the
best
,
but
the
pics
turned
out
ok
in
my
opinion
.
deleting
a
question
where
you
do
nt
like
the

wo
n't
get
you
better
answers
...
i
refer
to
my

:
you
need
to
learn
about
white
balance
,
composition
,
angle
,
and
work
on
using
the
camera
properly

and
she
most
be
very
new
to
modeling
,
because
she
does
look
unsure
of
her
poses
)
lol
,
he
has
posted
this
so
many
times
today
already
.
clearly
he
s
mad
that
people
know
he
took
her
pic
off
the
net
and
it
's
NOT
his
gf
Not
bad
,
but
too
many
distracting
elements
for
my
taste
.
For
example
:
In
the
photo
on
the
couch
,
the
pillow
she
is
resting
on
clashes
with
everything
else
in
the
shot
.
There
are
also
some
distracting
background
elements
like
the
light
fixture
and
what
looks
like
a
door
handle
on
the
left
.
In
the
standing
photo
(
from
the
front
)
there
is
a
corner
of
a
rug
creeping
in
,
some
kind
of
box
in
the
lower
right
corner
and
what
looks
like
a
power
cord
.
In
the
shot
from
the
back
,
the
crumpled
bottom
of
the
curtain
is
pretty
noticeable
as
well
as
the
power
outlet
.
Compositionally
,
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
,
I
would
suggest
trying
a
different
crop
because
I
do
nt
think
cutting
her
off
at
the
calf
looks
great
.
I
do
like
the
shadow
,
though
.
My
suggestion
is
to
pay
close
attention
to
what
's
going
on
in
the
background
and
if
possible
,
stand
on
a
chair
,
get
on
the
ground
,
do
whatever
you
need
to
do
to
get
rid
of
distracting
elements
.
Using
a
fairly
wide
aperture
is
also
helpful
in
blurring
out
unwanted
background
elements
.
I
've
had
a
few
great
shots
ruined
myself
because
there
was
something
in
the
background
I
did
n't
notice
at
first
.
what
are
some
unique
customs
in
ireland
?
As
far
ask
I
’m
aware
our
most
unique
custom
would
be
the
“
Country
Wake
”
.
In
all
my
travels
I
’ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
am
often
met
with
an
odd
look
when
I
explain
them
to
foreigners
.
After
a
person
dies
,
their
remains
are
“
waked
”
in
their
home
for
roughly
2
-
3
days
.
In
this
time
visitors
will
come
to
the
house
,
pay
their
respects
to
the
desisted
and
their
family
and
have
a
couple
of
cups
of
tea
with
a
sandwich
or
a
bun
.
The
wake
also
included
the
night
sit
were
friends
and
family
sit
up
through
the
night
with
the
remains
.
Wakes
are
common
both
north
and
south
of
the
boarder
with
Protestants
and
Catholics
alike
.
But
only
really
in
the
countryside
.
The
only
notable
difference
I
have
noticed
is
that
in
the
south
of
Ireland
one
night
of
the
wake
is
often
held
in
the
chapel
the
night
before
the
funeral
,
this
tradition
started
after
the
civil
war
.
Another
unique
custom
(
and
a
dying
one
at
that
)
is
the
Pioneers
.
The
Pioneers
was
an
organization
started
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
which
pushed
and
supported
the
ideal
of
temperance
(
abstaining
from
alcohol
)
,
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
the
massive
issue
of
alcoholism
that
Ireland
was
gripped
by
.
Pioneers
take
a
pledge
to
remain
tee
-
total
and
at
the
hight
of
the
organization
popularity
,
had
an
estimated
two
million
members
even
filling
Croke
Park
on
the
25th
anniversary
.
I
my
self
am
one
but
appreciate
that
the
organization
is
unlikely
to
make
into
the
22nd
century
.
The
Orange
Order
and
the
12th
of
July
Marches
would
be
argued
by
some
not
to
be
an
Irish
custom
but
unarguable
ticks
every
criteria
to
be
considered
one
.
The
marches
on
the
12th
of
July
are
only
really
attended
by
protestants
in
the
Ulster
but
in
spite
of
the
are
the
largest
attended
paraded
in
Ireland
.
Barn
brack
and
the
ring
.
the
irish
customs
we
have
in
our
family
are
;
we
make
sinnel
cake
for
easter
,
barn
brack
and
col
-
cannon
for
Halloween
.
christmas
cake
for
christmas
day
.
Do
animals
see
images
on
a
TV
screen
like
humans
do
?
Do
animals
see
images
on
a
TV
screen
like
humans
do
?
I
'm
unsure
of
this
,
because
once
I
watched
a
commercial
of
cat
food
with
my
cat
and
she
did
n't
react
to
seeing
another
cat
on
TV
.
I
heard
that
a
company
(
here
is
a
link
:
http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html
)
is
trying
to
make
a
dog
food
commercial
aimed
at
dogs
,
complete
with
squeaky
chew
-
toy
sounds
,
and
high
pitched
sounds
that
humans
ca
n't
hear
.
As
far
as
I
understand
,
this
ad
will
get
dogs
excited
,
but
my
question
is
:
Can
dogs
actually
see
the
images
featured
in
the
advert
like
humans
?
Also
,
can
animals
remember
images
on
TV
like
us
,
humans
?
If
so
,
then
does
that
mean
that
if
you
watched
a
scary
movie
and
your
dog
/
cat
/
parrot
was
in
the
same
room
as
you
they
will
also
get
scared
?
I
would
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
particularly
like
scary
movies
,
and
I
have
n't
tried
this
with
my
pet
.
Although
,
I
do
n't
think
that
scary
movies
will
affect
pets
for
a
long
time
;
I
am
sure
they
'll
forget
sometime
--
or
am
I
wrong
?
So
what
about
T.V.
?
Do
dogs
enjoy
watching
T.V.
?
Well
,
T.V.
is
a
series
of
flickering
pictures
that
are
streamed
together
to
make
a
moving
picture
.
The
pictures
are
broadcast
at
a
rate
of
about
60
Hz
,
which
is
how
fast
they
need
to
move
for
us
to
see
them
as
a
moving
,
flawless
picture
.
To
a
dog
,
watching
T.V.
is
a
lot
like
watching
and
old
scratchy
silent
film
because
their
flicker
fusion
seems
to
occur
at
a
rate
of
70
to
80
Hz
.
So
they
see
the
pictures
flicker
slower
and
there
for
it
seems
choppy
to
them
.
So
chances
are
that
if
your
dog
likes
to
watch
T.V.
,
it
’s
probably
because
of
the
sounds
.
Hearing
is
a
dog
’s
secondary
sense
,
and
I
will
discuss
that
in
another
blog
entery
.
Yes
they
do
.
i
m
pretty
sure
that
they
do
see
things
on
the
tv
screen
because
my
cat
chases
things
around
the
tv
screen
How
much
should
I
be
looking
at
for
horse
transportation
?
I
need
one
horse
transported
to
shows
throughout
the
2012
show
season
,
and
the
location
is
about
3
hours
away
from
where
I
live
.
The
place
where
I
'm
boarding
is
not
likely
to
want
to
take
me
this
far
,
and
I
do
not
have
any
ways
of
hauling
him
myself
.
So
I
want
to
hire
someone
(
or
multiple
people
)
to
transport
me
to
these
shows
.
If
they
ask
how
much
I
'm
willing
to
pay
,
what
is
a
good
price
range
?
I
saw
a
site
that
charges
$
0.70
per
mile
.
Is
that
reasonable
?
Impossible
to
say
,
but
I
guess
you
would
have
to
work
out
fuel
consumption
for
the
particular
vehicle
that
they
are
using
and
pay
a
proportion
of
that
,
and
some
on
top
for
the
driver
's
time
and
effort
,
unless
you
are
able
to
share
transport
with
another
or
more
,
that
would
keep
the
costs
down
.
Remember
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
Three
hours
is
n't
far
,
but
you
are
doing
multiple
shows
.
Some
people
are
willing
to
take
your
horse
,
but
they
really
have
old
trailers
that
are
not
the
safest
in
the
world
.
Rusted
,
torn
corners
in
the
stalls
,
unhealthy
air
,
straight
load
instead
of
slant
load
can
all
make
travelling
hard
,
if
not
downright
dangerous
,
on
your
horse
.
I
had
my
horse
transported
from
CA
to
WA
and
he
came
on
this
big
,
open
stock
trailer
.
He
was
dehydrated
when
he
got
there
and
lost
weight
.
Since
then
,
I
now
use
a
professional
horse
hauling
service
with
people
who
ride
with
my
horse
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
,
stop
every
few
hours
for
water
,
and
their
trailers
all
have
super
smooth
suspension
.
All
horses
I
've
had
delivered
to
me
since
then
are
happy
and
healthy
when
they
arrive
.
I
would
call
Bob
Hubbard
Transport
and
get
a
quote
.
Even
though
you
may
not
want
to
use
them
,
it
will
give
you
some
idea
of
what
it
might
cost
and
what
is
fair
.
See
link
below
.
Make
sure
the
trailer
service
you
use
is
bonded
/
insured
and
knows
something
about
first
aid
.
Do
they
have
this
anywhere
?
I
want
to
take
a
cruise
around
the
world
.
I
mean
literally
around
the
world
if
possible
.
First
of
if
i
went
alone
on
a
regular
cabin
how
much
would
you
estimate
it
would
be
just
a
guess
.
Second
is
there
any
way
to
sort
of
customize
the
places
you
wan
na
go
to
?
Like
you
can
pick
the
destinations
?
But
if
not
just
say
no
but
i
hope
there
is
like
one
out
there
somewhere
.

.
Here
's
a
site
that
lists
world
cruises
including
prices
.
http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1
Prices
listed
,
however
,
are
usually
based
on
two
people
in
a
cabin
,
and
you
will
likely
face
some
high
"
single
supplement
"
costs
in
addition
.
(
Two
people
in
a
cabin
will
spend
more
onboard
,
so
cruise
lines
charge
you
more
to
sail
alone
.
You
may
be
able
to
do
better
on
the
rates
if
you
request
competitive
quotes
via
CruiseCompete

Short
of
chartering
your
own
ship
and
crew
,
I
do
n't
see
any
way
you
could
customize
your
own
itinerary
.
Good
luck
!
Various
world
cruises
from
most
of
the
major
cruise
lines
,
typically
100
days
in
duration
.
Travelling
on
your
own
you
would
have
to
pay
double
as
cabins
are
sold
on
the
basis
of
double
occupancy
.
No
possibility
to
customise
ports
of
call
.
Prearranged
about
18
months
in
advance
as
the
cruise
lines
sell
segments
all
along
the
way
i.e
Transatlantic
to
London
(
England
)
,
England
to
Barcelona
(
Spain
)
,
Barcelona
to
Alexandria
(
Egypt
)
,
Egypt
to
India
via
Suez
canal
etc
.
yes
there
are
multiple
around
the
world
cruises
,
mainly
offered
by
the
more
upscale
lines
.
HOWEVER
:
you
will
pay
as
if
there
are
2
people
in
the
cabin
,
even
if
it
is
just
you
.
so
any
price
you
find
,
DOUBLE
IT
figure
,
$
40
K
at
least
.
and
no
you
can
not
customize
an
itinerary
unless
you
book
several
different
legs
of
a
cruise
with
stops
in
between
on
shore
..
say
book
a
Panamal
Canal
crossing
,
then
fly
to
Asia
and
pick
it
up
again
and
sail
to
India
then
fly
to
Europe
to
sail
the
Med
before
flying
to
England
to
hit
the
Transatlantic
corssing
.
Was
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
mostly
Caucasian
back
in
the
early
1970s
?
No
.
There
has
been
a
large
Asian
presence
in
the
SF
Bay
Area
for
a
long
time
--
the
Chinatown
here
was
the
largest
population
of
chinese
outside
of
China
,
there
were
lots
of
Japanese
who
'd
been
displaced
during
WWII
.
The
whole
Western
Addition
and
a
large
portion
of
the
Haight
was
black
.
The
Mission
was
basically
latin
-
american
.
As
the
southeast
asians
and
philipinos
came
over
,
they
added
to
the
cultures
.
So
,
the
Bay
Area
has
been
fairly
mixed
ethnically
for
a
long
time
--
caucasians
may
have
seemed
to
be
a
large
populous
but
that
's
because
most
tourists
back
then
were
caucasian
and
many
of
the
hippies
were
caucasians
so
that
's
who
the
photographers
took
pictures
of
.
The
other
ethicities
were
n't
well
represented
in
politics
yet
--
or
rather
,
they
were
just
breaking
the
color
barrier
in
the
70's
due
largely
to
the
more
open
-
minded
hippy
generation
.
Marin
County
was
predominantly
caucasian
and
many
of
the
expanding
outer
east
bay
areas
started
out
as
white
suburbs
.
It
was
not
so
long
after
Civil
Rights
laws
against
discrimination
started
to
have
an
impact
.
You
never
saw
black
MUNI
drivers
,
Asian
police
,
Latino
politicians
until
then
.
It
was
an
evolution
.
Many
illegals
were
not
counted
in
the
population
until
the
mid-80s
.
We
did
not
have
big
percent
of
Chinese
migration
until
the
mid
90s
.
We
had
fewer
people
running
across
the
Mexican
border
then
.
We
had
fewer
social
benefits
at
that
time
for
people
so
many
immigrants
were
not
counted
.
Only
Caucasians
had
any
political
power
,
corporate
presence
or
owned
businesses
except
for
Mom
and
Pop
stores
in
some
neighborhoods
.
San
Francisco
was
settled
in
the
19th
and
20th
century
by
mainly
European
immigrants
except
for
some
Asian
workers
who
were
manual
laborers
.
There
has
always
been
a
Mexican
-
American
cultural
influence
since
Calif
was
owned
by
Mexico
.
We
had
a
larger
black
population
in
the
70s
than
we
have
now
but
they
did
not
have
any
power
until
Willie
Brown
was
elected
.
San
Francisco
was
always
progressive
and
welcoming
and
tolerant
to
all
kinds
of
people
historically
.
The
counties
outside
San
Francisco
were
more
white
than
San
Francisco
in
the
70s

EDIT
:
My
memory
may
not
be
good
so
you
might
get
a
more
accurate
answer
from
someone
else
who
remembers
the
time
.
Can
rabbits
and
chickens
live
together
?
I
am
thinking
about
getting
a
rabbit
as
a
pet
,
but
my
parents
said
that
it
has
to
stay
outside
.
We
also
own
two
chickens
that
are
kept
in
a
run
behind
out
garage
/
barn
thing
.
There
is
already
a
little
dog
house
that
I
would
turn
into
a
little
rabbit
hutch
being
kept
back
there
and
I
was
thinking
about
keeping
the
rabbit
in
the
run
with
the
chickens
,
but
keeping
the
chickens
in
the
coop
and
the
rabbit
in
the
hutch
at
night
.
However
,
in
the
day
time
would
it
be
okay
for
the
rabbit
to
hop
around
along
with
the
chickens
?
We
feed
the
chickens
scraps
of
veggies
and
fruits
throughout
the
day
,
but
it
's
nothing
that
a
rabbit
would
n't
be
able
to
digest
just
fine
.
So
,
can
rabbits
and
chickens
live
together
as
long
as
they
have
separate
places
for
their
food
and
water
?
(
The
rabbit
hutch
would
have
an
opening
only
big
enough
for
the
rabbit
,
the
chickens
would
not
be
able
to
get
to
the
rabbit
food
)
Also
,
is
it
okay
if
the
rabbit
occasionally
sneaks
a
few
bites
of
chicken
feed
?
My
last
rabbit
did
that
a
few
times
,
and
he
was
fine
...
I
just
wan
na
make
sure
:)
Thank
!
Yes
,
but
be
sure
that
your
chickens
are
all
hens
(
I
mean
not
roosters
)
,
Roosters
may
attack
rabbits
or
anything
they
see
moving
,
so
be
aware
of
that
,
hens
are
friendly
with
almost
all
kinds
of
pets
!
From
my
experience
Hens
(
Not
roosters
)
are
very
friendly
with
duck
,
Guinea
pigs
,
kittens
,
cows
,
Rabbits
,
etc
.
Be
sure
not
to
feed
your
rabbits
non-veg
items
!
You
said
they
live
in
different
cages
and
they
are
free
in
day
,
so
no
problem
,
do
n't
put
both
of
them
in
one
cage
because
rabbits
bedding
is
different
than
that
of
hens
,
wet
bedding
can
cause
diseases
in
them
!
So
,
do
n't
put
both
of
them
in
one
cage
.
Good
luck
!
yea
i
guess
but
rabbits
a
easily
escape
a
pen
or
another
rabbit
could
get
in
there
and
that
rabbit
could
be
the
opposite
gender
.
So
be
very
careful
and
some
feeds
could
be
toxic
to
rabbits
and
safe
for
chickens
.
Rabbits
do
burrow
also
so
do
n't
be
surprised
if
chicken
are
falling
into
holes
.
rabbits
are
delicate
and
can
get
diseases
so
watch
out
for
that
.
melting
brass
did
not
work
?
my
friends
and
I
are
trying
to
melt
bras
to
make
some
little
figures
.
we
have
made
a
furnace
as
such
,
we
took
a
clay
flower
pot
with
a
hole
in
the
bottom
put
a
piece
of
steel
pipe
in
the
middle
of
it
with
a
cap
on
the
bottom
,
filled
the
pipe
with
brass
scrap
,
surounded
the
pipe
with
charcoal
lit
it
off
and
pumped
air
through
the
hole
in
the
pot
,
everything
got
red
hot
but
did
not
melt
.
what
am
I
doing
wrong
I
would
recommend
to
start
with
something
more
simple
like
tin
,
pewter
,
aluminum
or
zinc
,
they
all
have
a
much
more
reasonable
melting
point
.
I
'll
just
echo
both
other
answers
.
Molten
brass
is
damn
hot
and
usually
it
's
pressurized
gas
and
forced
air
or
oxygen
.
Even
if
you
did
melt
it
,
I
doubt
you
foresaw
the
issues
of
handling
it
and
pouring
it
.
It
's
really
too
advanced
for
a
beginner
,
both
in
tooling
and
safety
.
Just
the
zinc
fumes
will
get
you
,
if
you
do
n't
take
precautions
.
Pewter
is
perfect
for
what
you
are
doing
,
and
it
melts
on
a
stove
top
.
I
would
recommend
to
start
with
something
more
simple
like
tin
,
pewter
,
aluminum
or
zinc
,
they
all
have
a
much
more
reasonable
melting
point
.
Brass
has
an
even
higher
melting
point
than
bronze
and
I
would
think
your
charcoal
just
does
n't
get
hot
enough
.
I
bet
you
also
did
take
charcoal
as
it
is
used
for
barbecue
which
does
not
get
as
hot
as
real
coal
(
e.g.
for
blacksmithing
one
needs
coal
,
not
barbecue
charcoal
)
.
I
have
done
a
fair
amount
of
metal
casting
,
but
never
tried
to
build
my
own
furnace
,
but
I
think
your
version
is
just
too
small
and
does
n't
get
hot
enough
.
I
have
melted
small
amounts
of
bronze
in
a
crucible
with
a
large
propane
torch
(
much
larger
than
the
plumbers
torch
,
but
it
can
be
run
of
those
propane
cylinders
you
can
buy
for
a
gas
grill
)
.
I
melt
brass
and
cast
it
http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
Brass
melts
at
just
under
2000
F
which
is
a
bright
yellow
heat
,
not
red
hot
.

You
might
be
able
to
make
a
version
of
your
setup
work
,
but
it
would
take
quite
a
bit
of
charcoal
and
a
lot
of
forced
air
.
I
use
propane
with
a
blower
and
a
burner
I
built

and

Should
all
UK
towns
and
their
cafes
or
restaurants
provide
Halal
food
?
Some
friends
of
mine
visited
Dartmouth
in
Devon
whilst
on
holiday
last
summer
.
They
could
not
find
any
cafes
or
food
shops
that
provided
Halal
prepared
foods
.
It
s
important
to
their
religion
that
they
only
consume
Halal
food
.
Even
if
you
buy
a
cake
in
a
baker
s
you
can
not
be
too
what
happens
in
the
kitchen
,
for
example
the
cake
may
have
been
sliced
using
a
knife
used
for
preparing
ham
.
It
s
simply
not
just
a
case
of
avoiding
pork
,
alcohol
and
only
being
allowed
to
eat
halal
prepared
meat
,
but
the
kitchen
and
its
utensils
should
not
have
been
used
for
prohibited
foods
.
Places
like
Dartmouth
are
supposed
to
be
tourist
towns
and
should
provide
foods
for
people
of
all
religions
.
We
all
enjoy
buying
a
snack
when
visiting
a
town
or
attraction
while
on
holiday
.
Not
everyone
wants
to
bring
packed
lunch
.
It
s
not
fair
if
some
people
have
to
go
without
buying
food
because
no
place
will
provide
suitable
food
for
them
.
I
think
it
s
only
fair
that
nowadays
every
town
should
provide
at
least
one
halal
cafe
or
restaurant
and
hopefully
one
day
every
British
catering
establishment
will
be
halal
.
When
I
went
to
Bosnia
,
all
the
meat
was
Halal
.
I
will
not
eat
halal
meat
,
so
guess
what
,
I
opted
for
foods
which
were
n't
a
meat
dish
,
there
were
plenty
of
other
options
.
I
could
not
go
to
their
country
and
demand
they
slaughter
and
sell
an
animal
as
meat
the
way
I
prefer
to
eat
it
.
When
you
go
to
another
country
,
you
live
by
their
way
of
life
and
their
laws
,
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
know
how
to
get
back
out
the
country
(
but
I
guess
our
benefits
system
is
too
much
to
throw
away
,
huh
)
.
Cafes
and
restaurants
rarely
use
the
same
cutlery
for
different
food
groups
anyway
,
they
normally
have
blue
for
bakery
items
,
red
for
cooked
meat
,
brown
for
raw
meat
,
etc
-
all
for
food
preparation
and
hygiene
policies
.
No
.
To
prevent
animal
cruelty
,
many
countries
forbid
Halal
and
Kosher
meat
.
Switzerland
is
one
,
and
the
Netherlands
are
passing
the
same
law
.
It
will
become
EU
law
in
a
couple
of
years
.
We
ca
n't
dictate
what
business
wants
to
open
where
.
If
someone
thinks
there
is
a
business
opportunity
then
they
will
start
opening
halal
only
places
.
How
to
convince
my
parents
to
let
me
get
a
Ball
python
?
They
do
n't
know
ANYTHING
about
Ball
pythons
.
When
I
ask
my
mom
she
says
she
will
never
let
a
snake
in
her
house
.
She
has
no
experience
with
snakes
and
has
never
held
one
.
I
did
all
my
research
and
am
well
prepared
to
keep
one
,
I
'm
14
by
the
way
Lay
some
knowledge
on
them
dude
.
Maybe
if
they
see
how
much
time
and
effort
you
've
devoted
to
researching
the
animal
they
'll
reconsider
.
Tell
them
it
costs
like
8
dollars
a
month
(
if
even
that
much
)
to
keep
it
fed
.
Be
helpful
around
the
house
to
show
that
even
if
you
ca
n't
pay
for
it
yourself
that
you
re
willing
to
work
for
it
.
Once
you
've
buttered
them
up
a
bit
try
to
get
them
to
the
pet
store
and
ask
one
of
the
employees
to
handle
the
snake
showing
your
mom
how
gentle
and
harmless
they
can
be
.
Maybe
even
try
to
get
your
mom
to
hold
it
a
bit
.
My
wife
was
TERRIFIED
of
snakes
when
we
first
met
,
I
introduced
her
to
one
out
my
baby
corn
snakes
and
she
fell
in
love
with
it
.
Be
persistent
,
but
do
n't
pester
them
about
it
cause
that
'll
get
you
nowhere
fast
.
Good
luck
!
My
general
convince
your
parents
to
let
you
get
a
reptile
advice
:
1
.
Be
responsible
.
Do
all
your
chores
without
being
nagged
,
take
care
of
any
existing
pets
,
keep
your
room
clean
,
and
so
on
.
Prove
,
to
your
parents
'
satisfaction
,
that
you
,
not
they
,
will
be
the
one
actually
taking
care
of
your
new
pet
.
2
.
Save
up
,
and
research
,
so
that
you
are
ready
for
your
new
pet
.
3
.
Bargain
with
them
.
Offer
to
do
extra
chores
,
ask
for
your
pet
as
a
reward
for
good
grades
,
something
like
that
.
4
.
Play
the
sympathy
card
.
If
you
can
find
a
pet
at
a
shelter
,
or
that
a
friend
needs
to
get
rid
of
because
they
're
moving
or
whatever
,
you
might
be
able
to
talk
your
parents
into
"
giving
it
a
good
home
"
where
you
might
not
be
able
to
talk
them
into
buying
a
new
pet
.
On
the
fear
angle
--
talk
her
into
coming
to
the
pet
store
with
you
.
Once
you
're
there
,
ask
if
you
can
hold
a
ball
python
.
Once
you
're
holding
it
,
try
to
get
her
to
touch
/
pet
it
...
My
Snake
's
meal
is
TOO
big
,
what
can
I
do
?
Just
today
I
bought
a
medium
rat
for
my
beloved
Ball
Python
Salazar
(
name
after
Harry
Potter
)
.
Last
time
I
got
a
medium
rat
it
was
a
girl
and
my
snake
handled
her
easily
.
But
today
,
I
got
a
boy
and
realized
that
he
is
HUGE
!
I
really
do
love
my
snake
cause
she
is
actually
an
affectionate
cold
-
blooded
creature
.
So
my
true
question
comes
to
this
,
how
can
I
knock
the
rat
out
?
If
I
threw
him
against
a
wall
and
still
conscious
he
will
run
away
,
do
I
hang
him
by
the
tail
so
the
blood
can
flush
into
his
skull
?
I
really
do
need
answers
and
advice
,
and
NOT
INSULTING
ANSWERS
!!
LIKE
SERIOUSLY
!!
>:(
Best
answer
shall
receive
points
:)
iw
ould
just
stick
him
in
the
tank
and
let
your
snake
have
a
nice
hunt
for
once
,
snakes
jaws
detach
for
this
sort
of
this
thing
,
so
why
not
give
her
a
good
hunt
,
but
if
you
do
want
him
knock
him
i
d
just
throw
him
against
the
wall
or
something
,,
lol
i
do
nt
know
,
i
agree
with
you
though
throw
him
,
haha
Ok
so
if
youre
snake
will
take
pre-killed
,
you
can
"
gas
it
"
.
Just
put
the
rat
in
a
sealed
tupperwear
container
with
no
airholes
and
wait
until
it
passes
out
and
dies
and
then
feed
it
.
If
it
wo
n't
take
pre-killed
and
you
usually
feed
live
then
you
could
hold
the
rat
by
the
tail
and
whack
it
against
a
hard
surface
,
like
a
refrigerator
or
wall
.
I
do
n't
like
that
option
though
-
I
think
it
's
pretty
cruel
and
I'd
not
done
properly
you
'll
end
up
really
hurting
the
rat
but
not
stunning
him
enough
to
stop
possible
injury
to
your
snake
.
I
would
do
the
tupperwear
idea
TBH
-
easiest
and
most
humane
.
You
could
also
just
wait
until
the
rat
passes
out
for
about
1
minute
and
them
feed
it
-
at
this
point
,
it
could
still
have
a
bit
of
a
heart
beat
and
be
slightly
still
alive
.
And
also
maybe
try
holding
the
rat
in
feeding
prongs
so
your
snake
can
get
a
good
hold
and
grip
on
his
prey
.
Good
luck
!
Just
my
opinion
here
-
no
judgement
-
getting
your
snake
on
frozen
/
thawed
will
prove
to
be
much
easier
for
you
and
safer
for
your
snake
in
the
long
run
.
My
opinion
-
take
it
for
what
it
's
worth
…

Looking
to
move
to
Toronto
?
I
am
a
20
something
gay
black
male
and
I
am
looking
for
suggestions
on
neighborhoods
close
to
the
downtown
Toronto
area
.
Im
moving
from
South
Carolina
so
this
will
already
be
a
huge
culture
shock
.
Any
suggestions
?
Being
gay
and
living
in
Toronto
is
just
fine
.
You
may
consider
the
Gay
Village
on
Church
Street
,
right
downtown
.
It
is
full
of
gay
friendly
"
everything
"
.
But
,
you
could
live
where
ever
you
fancy
takes
you
.
For
obvious
reasons
,
knowing
how
extremely
difficult
it
is
to
drive
a
car
in
the
city
,
you
should
probably
try
to
be
near
the
subway
system
.
But
,
can
you
immigrate
?
Being
an
American
guarantees
you

How
to
train
my
puppy
?
I
have
a
4
months
Shih
Tzu
puppy
.
Recently
I
'm
having
trouble
training
him
.
He
is
kind
of
hate
walking
with
leash
,
every
time
I
put
the
leash
on
,
he
will
try
to
bite
it
.
And
he
is
not
following
me
when
I
was
walking
.
I
saw
lots
of
videos
about
this
,
but
actually
it
did
n't
help
.
Is
there
any
way
can
let
him
know
how
to
walk
with
leash
?
And
every
time
he
see
some
one
he
will
rush
to
people
and
jump
on
them
,
does
n't
listen
to
me
.
He
is
really
excited
about
anybody
he
see
.
How
to
prevent
this
?
Last
thing
is
every
time
I
sit
on
a
chair
or
something
higher
than
him
,
he
will
try
to
jump
on
,
if
he
ca
n't
,
he
will
bark
all
the
time
until
I
let
him
get
on
,
what
should
I
do
with
this
?
Anyone
have
any
suggestion
?
thank
you
very
much
.
Hi
,
I
am
a
dog
trainer
for
25
yrs
.
You
need
to
purchase
what
is
called
a
shoulder
point
harness
.
This
type
of
harness
goes
around
the
dog
s
chest
and
legs
and
has
a
clip
for
the
leash
up
on
the
back
of
the
dog
in
middle
of
shoulder
blades
.
This
way
,
he
can
not
reach
the
leash
to
chew
it
.
When
he
swivels
his
head
to
go
for
it
anyway
,
tell
him
sharp
"
UH
UH
"
gently
correct
him
with
a
small
tug
and
continue
your
walk
.
Do
this
repeatedly
and
frequently
and
he
will
learn
to
walk
on
a
leash
.
Patience
is
the
key
here
.
He
is
a
young
pup
and
will
learn
over
time
and
consistency
in
his
training
.
And
always
,
always
train
with
love
and
positive
methods
-
never
hit
or
harshly
scold
.
Never
train
out
of
fear
.
You
want
your
dog
to
admire
you
as
his
pack
leader
,
not
fear
you
.
Good
luck
with
your
puppy
!
All
the
best
.
Put
him
in
dog
obedience
school
or
call
a
professional
dog
trainer
.
:)
why
do
nt
you
get
some
treats
that
he
loves
and
only
give
him
them
when
he
does
something
right
.
or
,
as
i
saw
on
embarrassing
pets
on
tv
,
get
a
clicker
type
thing
and
treats
as
well
.
try
to
train
him
to
heel
,
which
means
to
walk
round
you
before
he
needs
to
go
on
a
leash
,
and
he
may
do
that
.
or
you
could
even
spray
some
scented
spray
on
the
leash
and
he
will
go
for
the
scent
and
probably
,
if
you
act
quick
enough
,
will
stay
on
the
leash
.
What
sort
of
Hotel
could
I
expect
to
find
in
New
Delhi
/
Agra
/
Varanasi
for
rs
500
per
night
?
Hey
guys
.
I
'm
looking
to
visit
India
with
some
mates
at
the
beginning
of
February
next
year
and
I
am
wandering
what
standard
of
accommodation
we
could
get
for
Rs
500
per
person
per
night
.
There
would
be
four
of
us
so
we
would
probably
be
looking
at
2
twin
rooms
for
Rs
1000
,
close
to
the
centre
of
these
cities
.
This
would
be
on
a
walk
-
in
basis
as
we
want
to
have
the
freedom
of
finding
a
place
that
looks
good
(
Not
relying
on
pictures
from
the
internet
)
and
is
in
a
spot
we
like
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
sharing
your
experience
!
Sorry
,
almost
forgot
to
ask
-
Would
it
be
cheaper
to
walk
-
in
to
these
hotels
rather
than
pre
book
?
In
Delhi
I
'd
recommend
Ajay
Guesthouse
.
Travelled
to
Delhi
twice
and
stayed
there
twice
.
Rooms
start
from
500
per
double
.
Those
ones
are
quite
small
.
Must
say
,
in
Delhi
it
's
hard
to
get
good
price
/
quality
rating
.
I
have
found
this
hotel
in
the
Lonely
Planet
guide
.
It
's
in
an
area
starting
with
a
P
,
many
tourist
hotels
there
and
the
location
is
very
nice
.
But
in
general
,
Delhi
is
the
hardest
place
to
find
a
nice
clean
hotel
for
that
price
.
In
Varanasi
I
do
n't
know
.
I
've
stayed
in
a
more
expensive
hotel
there
,
but
you
can
check
some
travelguides
or
tripadvisor
?
Also
,
while
travelling
ask
people
where
they
've
been
and
if
they
have
any
hotel
recommendations
.
In
Agra
I
've
stayed
in
a
place
fellow
travellers
recommended
,
they
found
it
in
the
Rough
Guide
.
It
was
nice
and
close
to
the
Taj
.
It
was
quite
easy
to
find
something
.
(
Do
nt
stay
in
Agra
too
long
.
One
night
is
enough
!
)
There
were
many
hotels
there
.
I
ve
paid
500
for
a
double
room
there
and
it
was
fine
and
clean
.
Good
luck
,
enjoy
your
time
!
You
may
find
a
normal
budget
hotel
for
Rs
1000
per
night
in
the
cities
you
mentioned
,
the
links
below
may
help
you
to
find
good
hotels
in
Delhi
and
Agra
.

To
Stay
in
delhi
-
Hotel
Aster
Inn
is
best
to
stay
in
delhi
.
it
is
in
karol
bagh
.
some
beautiful
locations
like
close
to
Karol
Bagh
Shopping
Market
,
Presidential
Palace
,
and
Birla
Mandir
Temple
and
Connaught
Place
and
Jantar
Mantar
are
near
to
it
.
TO
Stay
in
Agra
-
Hotel
Atithi
and
Aditya
Palace
is
perfect
for
you
.
it
is
centrally
situated
.
To
Stay

Sandeep
Hotel
is
you
choice
...
which
one
out
of
these
makes
the
best
pet
?
a
degu
,
a
rat
,
a
mouse
,
a
hamster
or
a
guinea
pig
?
and
why
is
the
one
a
better
pet
?
Get
a
guinea
pig
.
I
have
a
hamster
,
and
mice
and
rats
like
to
escape
.
The
Guinea
pig
is
better
because
it
s
a
lot
larger
than
a
hamster
,
rat
,
mouse
,
or
degu
.
So
if
you
lose
him
,
he
is
easier
to
find
,
because
smaller
rodents
just
LOVE
to
escape
from
their
cages
.
So
my
opinion
is
Guinea
pigs
.
(
plus
they
do
nt
stink
that
bad
)
Depends
on
what
you
want
in
a
pet
,
to
be
honest
.
Also
depends
on
the
space
you
have
,
how
much
time
you
can
handle
the
pet
,
how
much
money
you
can
spend
,
etc
.
I
've
had
experience
with
all
of
those
pets
except
Degus
.
My
favorite
would
have
to
be
the
rat
.
They
're
incredibly
social
,
highly
trainable
,
and
very
clean
.
Mine
learned
to
"
go
to
the
bathroom
"
only
in
their
cages
and
loved
to
ride
on
my
shoulder
or
hang
out
in
my
hoodie
pouch
.
The
only
downside
is
they
should
be
kept
in
pairs
or
trios
and
require
a
pretty
large
habitat
.
That
means
expense
,
space
,
and
they
require
weekly
cage
cleaning
.
My
second
favorite
would
have
to
be
the
Guinea
Pig
-
not
quite
as
social
with
people
as
rats
(
at
least
mine
was
n't
)
but
more
so
than
most
hamsters
or
mice
.
Again
,
pairs
or
trios
and
pretty
big
living
space
.
They
,
too
,
need
weekly
cage
cleaning
and
can
cost
quite
a
bit
.
I
could
handle
my
mice
,
but
they
where
skittish
and
preferred
their
cage
.
I
've
never
met
a
hamster
that
did
n't
bite
me
.
Never
had
/
handled
a
Degu
.
Get
a
guinea
pig
.
We
have
two
.
They
are
social
and
like
to
be
handled
.
You
have
to
have
two
because
they
do
n't
do
well
alone
.
Make
certain
you
get
two
females
.
Two
males
can
fight
and
you
definitely
do
n't
want
babies
!!
Guinea
pigs
(
also
called
cavies
)
are
gentle
creatures
and
are
awake
during
the
day
and
sleep
at
night
.
They
will
whistle
when
they
hear
you
as
an
encouragement
for
you
to
give
them
a
treat
like
leaf
lettuce
.
They
love
leaf
or
romaine
lettuce
and
tomatos
,
celery
,
cucumbers
,
carrots
.
Do
n't
feed
them
broccoli
,
cauliflower
,
garlic
,
onions
,
head
lettuce
....
they
are
all
too
difficult
for
them
to
digest
.
Also
they
ca
n't
eat
potatos
,
they
are
toxic
for
them
.
If
you
keep
the
cage
clean
they
do
n't
smell
and
you
can
buy
spray
on
cleaser
for
them
,
just
massage
it
into
their
coat
and
groom
them
.
Fostering
6
week
old
kittens
and
HATING
IT
!
Need
Advice
!?
I
wanted
to
volunteer
and
help
animals
,
and
decided
to
try
fostering
kittens
.
This
is
my
first
experience
and
I
have
two
six
week
old
kittens
right
now
and
am
at
my
wit
s
end
.
I
do
not
want
to
have
to
bring
them
back
before
they
are
eight
weeks
old
but
they
are
ruining
my
apartment
.
They
track
poop
everywhere
(
most
disgustingly
my
bed
....
)
,
and
am
constantly
trying
to
climb
up
everything
,
including
my
bare
legs
!
My
legs
and
hands
are
just
full
of
scratches
.
I
realize
they
are
young
and
that
cats
do
climb
,
but
this
is
just
ridiculous
.
My
apartment
also
smells
repulsive
even
though
I
am
cleaning
out
their
litter
box
at
least
once
a
day
if
not
twice
.
Any
suggestions
and
helpful
hints
to
make
this
a
more
positive
experience
would
be
extremely
appreciated
.
That
's
kind
of
the
way
it
goes
..
lol
.
Limit
them
to
one
room
with
easy
to
clean
flooring
.
If
you
have
limited
options
,
try
the
bathroom
.
Make
sure
there
are
plenty
of
litter
boxes
that
are
cleaned
often
.
Depending
on
the
batch
of
kittens
,
I
will
often
have
as
many
as
one
per
kitten
.
They
can
produce
a
lot
of
waste
and
even
scooping
twice
a
day
they
can
get
messy
.
For
some
reason
it
takes
them
awhile
to
learn
not
to
step
in
poop
.
Also
if
they
have
diarrhea
,
check
in
with
your
foster
coordinator
.
They
made
need
medication
or
deworming
or
something
.
They
are
testing
out
their
claws
and
teeth
.
To
some
degree
you
can
/
should
help
teach
them
not
to
use
their
teeth
and
claws
inappropriately
.
But
in
the
meantime
,
highly
recommend
jeans
and
long
sleeves
anytime
you
'll
be
interacting
with
the
kittens
.
Then
take
care
of
yourself
.
Get
plenty
of
sleep
and
make
sure
you
take
time
out
to
do
some
things
you
enjoy
.
Try
visiting
the
kittens
a
few
times
a
day
for
short
periods
of
time
.
Try
to
go
in
there
with
the
right
frame
of
mind
and
enjoy
them
for
what
they
are
.
If
you
still
do
n't
enjoy
the
kittens
,
see
what
other
opportunities
are
available
.
They
may
need
foster
homes
for
adult
cats
in
different
situations
..
sick
,
recovering
from
surgery
,
need
a
little
socialization
,
etc
.
I
find
the
adults
are
much
easier
.
Generally
they
're
not
clawing
and
biting
,
they
do
n't
make
nearly
as
much
mess
,
they
do
n't
need
nearly
as
much
litterbox
scooping
,
etc
:)
Decide
volunteering
is
not
your
thing
and
give
them
back
!
And
do
more
research
before
you
agree
next
time
;-)
Take
the
kittens
back
to
the
shelter
.
Maybe
do
volunteer
work
at
the
humane
society
,
walk
dogs
,
groom
the
animals
etc
.
what
r
the
requirements
to
apply
for
a
delay
birth
certificate
in
canada
?
what
r
the
evidentary
requirements
to
apply
for
a
delay
birth
certificate
in
canada
?
including
fees
and
forms
It
depends
on
if
you
ever
registered
the
birth
.
Some
places
do
the
registration
right
at
the
hospital
....
in
some
smaller
places
,
you
need
to
register
your
child
's
birth
at
the
town
hall
/
registrar
's
office
.
My
first
three
children
were
born
in
Southern
Ontario
cities
.
The
birth
registration
was
done
right
in
hospital
.
My
last
son
,
was
born
in
Northern
Ontario
....
I
did
n't
know
that
I
did
n't
register
him
in
the
ridiculous
amount
of
paperwork
I
had
filled
out
in
the
hospital
and
was
supposed
to
go
to
city
hall
within
90
days
.
Two
years
later
when
I
got
around
to
filling
for
his
birth
certificate
,
I
find
out
he
was
never
registered
.
I
had
to
call
the
Office
of
the
Registrar
General
in
Thunder
Bay
,
have
copies
of
the
delayed
registration
form
mailed
out
to
me
,
as
they
do
n't
have
an
online
area
for
it
yet
,
fill
those
out
,
send
them
away
,
then
apply
for
his
birth
certificate
.
If
you
are
just
applying
for
a
birth
certificate
for
the
first
time
,
it
s
simple
to
do
it
over
the
computer
.
For
$
56
you
can
even
have
it
expedited
and
will
get
in
three
business
days
or
your
money
back
.
This
is
in
Ontario
of
course
,
the
rates
may
be
slightly
different
for
other
provinces
/
territories
.
You
just
need
basic
information
,
and
answer
a
few
questions
like
what
hospital
was
the
child
born
at
/
who
was
the
doctor
....
None
,
just
walk
in
to
the
service
office
and
present
all
the
identification
you
have
to
prove
your
identity
.
they
may
then
chose
to
ask
you
to
bring
more
evidence
,
or
just
look
up
the
record
and
hand
you
the
certificate
.
You
can
probably
do
it
all
on
-
line
.
Start
here
if
you
were

Good
luck
My
parents
did
n't
send
for
my
birth
certificate
until
I
was
16
and
needed
it
for
summer
employment
.
It
was
no
problem
to
get
PROVIDED
the
birth
was
registered
in
the
first
place
.
I
add
that
in
because
there
have
been
some
people
who
have
tried
to
claim
citizenship
by
sending
for
their
birth
certificate
when
they
were
never
really
born
in
Canada
or
to
Canadian
parents
.
When
a
child
is
born
in
Canada
the
birth
is
registered
before
the
baby
can
leave
the
hospital
.
As
long
as
that
was
done
you
can
send
for
it
at
any
time
.
Each
provincial
government
has
a
website
that
lists
the
process
for
that
Province
so
depending
upon
where
you
were
born
you
can
google
it
.

ship

Carnival
and
Royal
Caribbean
are
two
popular
cruise
lines
that
have
strong
followings
.
Some
cruise
aficionados
refuse
to
sail
on
one
or
the
other
.
Are
there
any
major
differences
between
them
?
Explore
which
cruise
may
fit
your
needs
the
best
.
For
our
comparison
we
sailed
on
two
similar
ships
-
the
Carnival
Liberty
and
the
Royal
Caribbean
Mariner
of
the
Seas
.
Itinerary
Both
ships
go
to
Caribbean
Islands
like
Jamaica
,
Grand
Cayman
,
Cozumel
,
St.
Thomas
,
the
Bahamas
and
St.
Martin
/
St.
Maarten
.
The
Liberty
also
visited
its
private
island
Half
Moon
Cay
,
Puerto
Rico
,
and
Grand
Turk
.
The
Mariner
of
the
Seas
traveled
to
its
private
island
Coco
Cay
and
Labadee
(
the
north
coast
of
Haiti
)
.
We
loved
most
of
the
locations
that
both
of
the
ships
visited
and
do
n't
believe
that
this
should
be
a
distinguishing
factor
on
deciding
between
the
cruise
lines
.
Shows
Each
night
there
are
a
variety
of
shows
.
Usually
you
have
the
main
show
and
some
type
of
entertainment
before
and
perhaps
afterward
.
We
felt
that
the
main
shows
on
the
Mariner
of
the
Seas
were
better
.
On
the
Liberty
we
liked
the
comedian
and
juggling
act
.
If
you
love
seeing
the
shows
,
Royal
Caribbean
was
better
for
the
main
shows
and
Carnival
was
slightly
better
for
the
comedians
.
Dining
Room
We
enjoyed
the
atmosphere
of
both
dining
rooms
on
the
Liberty
and
Mariner
of
the
Seas
.
We
felt
that
the
menu
had
a
little
more
variety
on
the
Mariner
of
the
Seas
.
Friendliness
of
staff
The
Liberty
and
Mariner
of
the
Seas
both
get
high
grades
.
We
did
have
one
waiter
that
complained
some
on
one
of
our
trips
on
the
Mariner
.
We
had
a
slightly
better
experience
on
the
Liberty
,
but
feel
that
both
crews
did
an
excellent
job
and
that
this
should
not
be
a
distinguishing
factor
on
choosing
a
cruise
.
Pools
The
Mariner
of
the
Seas
and
Liberty
both
had
salt
water
pools
-
which
most
cruise
ships
have
.
They
both
had
pools
for
kids
and
adults
.
We
liked
the
Liberty
's
pools
better
because
one
had
a
slide
.
If
you
have
kids
,
this
would
be
something
that
they
would
definitely
enjoy
.
Spa
We
tried
the
spa
on
the
Liberty
and
loved
it
.
We
did
not
try
the
spa
on
the
Mariner
of
the
Seas
.
Usually
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
when
getting
a
spa
treatment
......
Royal
Caribbean
is
better
,
but
the
best
cruiseline
is
Regent
Seven
Seas
.
Look

their

Royal
Caribbean
.
Carnival
has
been
called
the
WalMart
of
cruise
lines

What
countries
are
the
best
to
travel
to
?
I
really
want
to
travel
when
I
leave
school
!
Where
in
the
states
could
I
go
?
Where
in
Europe
?
Have
you
every
traveled
before
?
How
long
should
I
go
for
to
each
place
?
(
I
Have
1
year
before
collage
!
)
&
Also
how
much
money
would
I
need
?
So
I
can
start
saving
now
hehe
Thanks
:)
I
mean
when
I
graduate
&
yes
,
college
,
sorry
for
the
typo
.
Leave
High
School
?
Not
the
smartest
move
to
take
off
on
a
worldly
adventure
if
you
've
never
traveled
before
and
you
do
n't
put
where
you
would
be
traveling
from
.
In
the
United
States
?
Lots
of
places
.
There
are
50
of
them
,
48
located
from
Maine
to
Florida
and
California
to
Washington
State
and
all
in
between
.
There
are
2
more
located
outside
of
the
main
continent
with
Alaska
way
to
the
north
and
Hawaii
in
the
Pacific
.
What
do
you
like
to
do
?
Big
Cities
like
New
York
,
Boston
,
Philadelphia
on
the
East
Coast
.
Beaches
and
Disney
of
Florida
or
the
Mid
Atlantic
cities
of
Atlanta
,
Savannah
,
Charleston
.
The
federal
sites
of
Washington
,
DC
.
Southern
charm
of
Nashville
,
Birmingham
,
New
Orleans
or
Charlotte
.
West
Coast
hot
spots
like
Seattle
,
Portland
,
San
Francisco
,
Los
Angeles
or
San
Diego
.
Europe
?
Just
as
numerous
as
the
possibilities
of
the
US
.
Do
you
speak
a
foreign
language
?
I
could
spend
a
year
in
Spain
alone
.
From
Madrid
to
Seville
to
Barcelona
an
Valencia
.
Bilboa
on
the
north
coast
,
Pamplona
and
the
very
famous
Guernica
.
A
road
trip
to
Lisbon
and
the
Algarve
in
Portugal
before
a
mountain
escape
in
the
Pyrenees
and
a
stop
in
Andorra
before
heading
over
to
France
and
Italy
and
Austria
and
Switzerland
.
I
've
traveled
to
all
of
these
places
and
could
certainly
tailor
a
trip
to
your
needs
based
on
budget
,
actual
time
allowed
,
your
likes
and
dislikes
.
Amount
of
time
could
be
dependent
on
so
many
things
.
Do
you
want
to
see
all
the
sites
or
simply
a
few
photos
and
on
your
way
to
the
next
place
.
Does
your
budget
limit
you
to
how
long
you
can
stay
in
each
place
?
You
need
a
lot
of
money
for
hotels
,
airfare
,
seeing
the
sites
,
food
,
local
transport
-
you
name
it
but
life
costs
.
Once
you
have
a
budget
or
an
amount
in
the
bank
then
you
'll
be
able
to
figure
out
where
you
can
go
,
for
how
long
you
can
go
and
what
you
can
do
when
you
're
there
.
1
year
before
collage
or
college
?
Good
luck
.
I
recommend
buying
a
single
unlimited
Europass
and
travelling
anywhere
in
the
EU
your
heart
desires
.
You
ca
n't
beat
the
price
for
what
you
get
.
come
to
Africa
.
Nigeria
,
a
lovely
country
.
But
where
in
nigeria
?
Obudu
cattle
ranch
.
More
than
a
tourist
centre
.
How
do
you
make
your
cat
adjust
to
a
new
house
?
Me
and
my
family
are
moving
into
a
new
house
just
outside
a
small
town
.
We
are
currently
living
a
mile
from
the
town
in
a
house
surrounded
by
fields
but
the
new
house
is
beside
a
busy
road
.
We
have
had
the
cat
for
10
years
and
do
nt
want
to
leave
it
.
How
could
we
make
it
settle
in
a
new
house
.
you
are
not
just
moving
house
-
your
cat
is
losing
his
territory
.
territory
is
very
important
to
cats
,
and
they
are
very
nervous
when
they
go
into
a
new
place
-
a
new
house
could
be
full
of
predators
,
or
unknown
menaces
-
well
at
least
he
thinks
so
.
you
will
need
to
give
him
only
a
small
place
to
explore
,
so
he
can
make
it
his
territory
,
and
feel
safe
there
.
then
,
he
can
have
a
place
to
retreat
to
when
he
feels
scared
.
you
will
need
to
get
his
box
and
bowls
,
and
whatever
blanket
and
toys
are
his
,
and
smell
like
home
,
and
put
him
in
a
room
.
the
room
you
sleep
in
is
best
(
seeing
you
so
relaxed
that
you
are
sleeping
will
send
the
message
that
everything
is
OK
)
,
but
others
will
work
just
as
well
.
close
the
door
,
and
keep
him
in
there
for
a
week
.
he
will
feel
much
safer
in
that
one
room
,
than
in
a
huge
unknown
house
.
he
will
explore
the
room
,
mark
everything
with
his
cheek
,
and
try
to
make
it
feel
like
his
territory
.
he
will
reassure
himself
that
no
other
animal
is
in
there
,
and
that
no
other
animal
will
come
in
-
he
is
afraid
that
he
is
in
someone
else
's
territory
when
he
is
in
a
new
house
.
in
a
week
's
time
,
he
will
have
made
it
his
,
and
will
be
getting
more
bored
than
afraid
.
let
him
out
for
half
an
hour
,
to
explore
.
then
put
him
back
in
.
he
will
be
freaked
out
,
so
going
back
to
his
territory
will
make
him
much
happier
.
extend
the
time
he
is
out
each
day
,
but
for
the
first
month
,
always
put
him
in
his
room
at
night
,
so
he
feels
safe
to
sleep
.
soon
he
will
make
the
whole
house
his
,
but
he
needs
that
one
safe
place
to
start
from
.
remember
to
visit
with
him
while
he
is
in
the
room
,
and
tell
him
how
good
he
is
.
remember
to
give
him
the
time
he
needs
to
feel
that
the
room
is
his
-
rush
it
,
and
he
will
be
afraid
of
the
whole
house
for
a
long
time
.
he
might
even
start
peeing
on
things
in
fear
.
good
luck
with
your
new
house
and
with
his
new
territory
!
Let
her
explore
when
we
moved
my
cat
had
to
explore
the
entire
house
before
she
felt
comfortable
.
In
time
though
she
/
he
will
adjust
.
:)
they
just
do
it
on
their
own
.
I
just
adopted
a
2
year
old
male
German
Shepherd
with
Major
bad
behaviors
?
Last
night
,
I
adopted
a
2
year
old
Male
German
Shepherd
.
(
He
is
92
pounds
)
He
does
not
listen
to
any
commands
,
but
my
major
problem
is
that
he
will
not
go
outside
on
command
,
or
even
with
me
.
I
will
walk
outside
and
he
will
stand
at
the
door
and
stare
at
me
or
run
away
.
My
other
MAJOR
problem
is
that
he
will
not
get
in
his
crate
.
I
will
get
a
treat
and
try
to
get
him
in
there
that
way
,
it
wo
nt
work
.
He
wo
nt
even
get
close
to
the
crate
.
If
I
come
towards
him
,
he
will
run
away
.
How
do
I
train
him
to
feel
comfortable
in
his
crate
?
and
to
willingly
go
outside
...
and
to
come
on
command
.
He
wo
nt
do
anything
on
command
.
It
s
very
frustrating
.
I
have
a
9
month
old
German
Shepherd
that
I
raised
from
a
puppy
.
I
trained
her
myself
.
She
is
crate
trained
,
potty
trained
,
and
can
sit
,
lay
down
,
stay
,
come
,
fetch
,
and
will
even
stay
in
a
down
position
while
I
throw
a
treat
across
the
floor
or
even
right
next
to
her
paw
,
and
she
wo
nt
get
it
until
I
give
her
the
command
.
Yes
,
lots
of
time
and
lots
of
patients
...
I
just
do
nt
know
how
to
do
it
with
a
grown
dog
.
She
tosses
me
around
like
it
s
nothing
!
...
but
basically
,
what
I
do
is
the
same
thing
I
did
with
my
puppy
...
lots
of
patience
,
lots
of
time
,
lots
of
praise
,
lots
of
treats
,
and
lots
of
repition
....
Right
?
Is
there
any
tricks
I
could
use
?
Maybe
get
a
book
on
training
.
You
have
to
be
in
command
at
all
times
.
There
are
ways
to
get
your
new
dog
used
to
the
crate
or
going
out
.
I
would
start
with
a
leash
.
Put
the
leash
on
the
dog
and
just
walk
around
the
crate
a
few
times
.
Then
take
the
leash
off
and
do
nothing
else
but
that
.
Later
do
it
again
.
When
the
dog
is
ok
with
this
,
then
open
the
door
and
walk
around
the
crate
,
leave
the
door
open
all
the
time
.
Put
something
fun
inside
.
Let
your
dog
go
in
when
he
wants
to
for
no
reason
.
Do
not
shut
the
door
.
Let
him
walk
in
and
out
for
a
few
days
.
At
some
point
he
will
feel
ok
with
this
and
you
can
then
close
the
door
but
not
for
long
at
all
.
Open
the
door
and
let
him
out
and
see
how
he
acts
.
If
you
push
it
,
it
will
never
work
.
With
going
outside
,
put
the
leash
on
and
just
take
him
for
a
walk
.
He
will
learn
to
really
like
this
.
Potty
outside
will
come
at
some
point
.
Try
obedience
classes
.
Have
patience
with
him
,
you
just
got
him
and
who
knows
how
he
was
treated
before
you
brought
him
home
.
where
can
I
find
the
best
tours
to
the
Mekong
Delta
at
reasonable
prices
?
will
only
be
in
Ho
chi
Minh
for
4
days
and
I
am
looking
for
a
1
day
or
2
day
trip
to
Mekong
delta
.
I
have
been
researching
on
line
and
find
things
are
quite
pricey
but
the
tours
look
great
.
Should
I
just
settle
and
book
on
line
?
or
is
it
better
if
I
wait
till
I
get
there
?
If
I
wait
,
would
the
tours
I
find
there
for
less
money
be
the
same
quality
type
tours
?
Also
,
any
tour
recommendations
would
be
very
helpful
a
well
.
Thank
you
!
If
you
want
reliable
and
inexpensive
...
try
Sinh
Cafe
/
Tourist
.
The
are
located
right
at
248
De
Than
St.
in
the
heart
of
the
back
packer
district
.
I
have
taken
this
tour
and
it
was
great
.
I
did
an
overnight
in
a
home
stay
that
was
sweet
and
the
water
market
was
wonderful
.
I
do
n't
remember
the
exact
cost
but
remember
thinking
how
inexpensive
it
was
.
Also
,
Sinh
Cafe
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
is
very
reputable
.
And
no
,
I
do
not
work
for
them
.
:)
I
am
just
a
satisfied
customer
.
And
do
n't
expect
to
party
on
this
tour
.
The
south
is
not
like
the
regular
tourist
towns
.
Very
few
clubs
and
night
activities
.
Oh
,
if
you
are
confused
.
Sinh

is
not
a
Cafe
.
It
is
a

and
they
have
their

have
fun
.
There
is
n't
much
to
see
in
the
delta
,
it
's
a
lifestyle
not
a
resort
area
.
If
you
're
adventurous
you
can
take
a
bus
or
water
taxi
to
My
Tho
(
near
where
we
live
)
or
Can
Tho
.
From
either
of
those
cities
,
you
can
venture
out
and
spend
a
day
in
the
country
.
Most
of
the
tourists
that
I
've
come
across
buy
tours
along
the
My
Tho
waterfront
.
You
take
a
boat
across
the
river
,
then
spend
a
day
biking
,
eating
at
a
local
restaurant
,
buying
souvenirs
and
doing
other
things
that
are
geared
towards
tourists
.
The
countryside
is
very
beautiful
,
especially
if
you
have
a
few
months
(
or
years
)
to
get
to
know
the
place
.
PS
,
If
you
make
it
to
Thanh
Pho
Ben
Tre
,
stay
a
night
at
my
friend
Ken
's
hotel
.
It
's
called
Kiwi
Heaven
and
it
's
across
the
river
from
Cho
Ben
Tre
.
It
's
a
little
hard
to
get
to
by
foot
,
they
're
rebuilding
the
bridge
,
but
you
can
get
someone
to
moto
-
taxi
you
there
for
a
dollar
or
less
.
He
's
an
ex-pat
from
New
Zealand
and
he
's
been
in
town
for
awhile
.
He
'll
set
up
a
real
tour
of
the
area
for
you
,
not
some
tourist
fantasy
.
Have
a
good
trip
where
-
ever
you
end
up
.
We
went
with
Intrepid
as
a
part
of
their
North
to
South
Vietnam
Trip
,
but
they
do
offer
this
one
day
separately
.
We
had
a
great
time
and
visited
a
location
where
they
made
coconut
candies
,
visited
a
local
restaurant
which
was
attached
to
a
fish
farm
,
rode
in
modified
quad
bikes
and
had
some
tropical
food
at
what
appeared
to
be
a
local
hangout
.
Intrepid
is
good
at
getting
you
away
from
the
most
touristy
spots
and
showing
you
something
a
little
different
.
yoga
and
horses
.....
?
I
got
a
riding
lesson
today
on
one
of
my
boss
's
fino
horses
and
it
made
me
realize
just
how
unsteady
my
left
leg
is
.
I
mentioned
it
to
my
boss
and
she
said
to
start
doing
yoga
.
But
there
are
just
so
many
poses
and
programs
!
Any
good
poses
or
programs
(
I
'm
willing
to
buy
a
dvd
as
long
as
it
is
under
$
20
)
to
help
specifically
with
leg
stabilization
?
I
just
have
a
few
issues
supporting
my
back
and
my
left
leg
flops
.
Because
I
do
n't
feel
like
spending
over
$
20
on
a
freakin
DVD
I
also
have
back
problems
that
transfer
into
my
legs
.
I
have
done
Yoga
for
riders
for
a
while
,
a
20
minute
routine
I
found
on
YouTube
(
I
think
it
s
called
"
Yoga
for
horse
back
riding
"
hosted
by
a
man
)
It
helped
with
noticing
slight
differences
in
my
balance
and
weight
distribution
but
not
really
for
the
way
I
use
my
legs
and
back
.
Here
is
what
I
do
now
and
it
really
helps
....
When
I
first
get
on
I
take
1
leg
and
pull
it
back
up
to
touch
my
butt
with
my
heel
and
hold
it
there
for
1
lap
at
a
walk
around
a
large
dressage
arena
.
Then
the
same
thing
with
the
other
leg
.
Then
1
lap
at
a
walk
around
the
arena
with
both
my
legs
pulled
out
as
far
as
I
can
,
so
they
are
not
touching
the
saddle
.
Then
a
lap
doing
scissors
,
one
leg
forward
as
far
as
I
can
and
the
other
back
,
then
switch
legs
.
I
'll
also
trot
doing
,
down
2
beats
,
up
one
for
a
wile
,
then
up
2
down
1
making
sure
the
weight
is
going
into
the
balls
of
my
feet
.
If
the
weight
is
going
into
your
heels
(
it
throws
your
leg
forward
)
put
the
stirrups
up
against
the
heel
of
your
boot
.
Do
a
nice
working
trot
,
not
a
slow
trot
.
All
this
will
help
you
use
both
legs
evenly
,
keep
proper
contact
and
use
your
wight
correctly
,
to
keep
your
leg
in
a
good
position
.
BTW
you
do
nt
want
your
leg
locked
in
place
,
it
will
move
WITH
the
horse
a
bit
.
When
I
first
started
doing
it
I
'd
do
it
every
day
.
Now
I
just
do
it
once
or
twice
a
week
or
as
needed
.
Now
not
only
is
my
leg
better
,
but
my
back
is
relaxing
.
what
are
you
having
problems
with
?
i
would
n't
bother
with
yoga
i
'd
practice
more
with
riding
and
fixing
my
problem
,
ride
bareback
,
with
no
irons
,
there
s
also
a
way
to
ride
on
your
knees
?
that
help
alot
with
your
thigh
muscles
(
bareback
though
)
ya
i
really
would
n't
bother
with
the
yoga
maybe
a
back
brase
will
help
,
sometimes
my
back
really
gets
to
me
and
i
've
thought
about
getting
one
.
with
your
leg
flopping
,
just
try
putting
all
your
weight
in
your
heel
and
hang
on
with
only
your
legs
,
holding
my
leg
back
helps
me
with
flopping
the
more
it
's
forward
the
more
it
flops
:/
work
your
calf
muscles
,
maybe
try
standing
on
the
edge
of
your
steps
(
on
the
ball
of
your
foot
)
and
balance
to
strengthen
those
muscles
You
do
n't
want
to
spend
more
than
$
20
and
yet
you
have
an
expensive
hobby
like
riding
horses
?
I
really
ca
n't
help
you
.
What
to
feed
my
dog
after
gastroenteritis
?
My
dog
has
been
sick
for
about
3
days
now
.
He
has
been
having
diarheya
everywhere
and
he
began
to
vomit
last
night
.
I
thought
it
would
pass
until
he
started
to
vomit
blood
and
would
nt
drink
any
water
.
I
took
him
to
the
Animal
Hospital
and
they
ran
blood
work
and
everything
came
back
normal
.
No
pancreatitis
or
anything
abnormal
.
The
vet
said
it
was
gastroenteritis
and
gave
him
fluids
under
his
skin
,
an
injection
of
nausea
medication
along
with
some
take
home
antibiotics
.
So
my
question
is
..
Is
it
normal
for
dogs
to
throw
up
blood
while
having
gastroenteritis
?
and
will
these
antibiotics
help
?
I
have
tryed
to
give
him
water
but
he
wo
nt
take
it
..
what
should
i
do
?
i
do
nt
want
him
to
get
dehydrated
and
also
should
i
try
to
give
him
a
little
bit
of
food
?
...
Some
help
would
be
great
.
thank
you
:)
They
did
nt
take
x
-
rays
they
offered
them
but
i
just
could
nt
afford
any
more
treatment
.
I
feel
like
shit
for
saying
that
but
after
what
they
have
done
already
i
wo
nt
be
buying
grocerys
for
the
next
few
weeks
.
I
will
give
them
and
call
and
see
what
they
say
.
Thank
you
for
the
help
.
Ok
so
i
spoke
to
the
vet
and
he
said
the
give
him
white
rice
and
boiled
chicken
but
only
a
little
at
a
time
.
Seince
he
recieved
the
fluids
last
night
he
said
not
to
worry
about
drinking
water
for
at
least
a
couple
of
days
.
I
went
home
at
lunch
to
check
on
him
and
he
is
doing
1000
etter
he
was
actually
walkin
around
and
wagin
his
tail
:)
thanks
everbody
for
the
info
it
s
greatly
appreciated
.
To
answer
your
questions
in
order
:
1
)
It
is
not
normal
for
dogs
to
be
vomiting
,
much
less
to
have
blood
in
it
.
However
,
if
they
have
been
vomiting
numerous
times
,
then
the
blood
could
be
due
to
irritation
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
.
He
could
also
have
Parvovirus
,
a
GI
foreign
body
,
or
any
number
of
things
.
Did
your
vet
take
radiographs
(
x
-
rays
)
?
2
)
Your
vet
would
not
prescribe
them
if
they
did
n't
think
it
would
be
helpful
.
3
)
If
he
shows
no
interest
in
water
,
then
take
him
back
to
your
vet
.
It
could
be
due
to
nausea
or
any
number
of
things
.
He
could
become
severly
dehydrated
(
especially
if
he
continues
to
vomit
and
have
diarrhea
)
.
From
there
you
end
up
with
electrolyte
imbalances
,
which
can
lead
to
heart
and
kidney
problems
.
And
being
dehydrated
,
vomiting
,
and
having
diarrhea
just
does
n't
feel
good
.
4
)
Call
your
vet
.
They
should
have
discussed
a
bland
diet
with
you
,
including
the
frequency
of
feeding
and
how
much
to
feed
at
each
sitting
.
It
sounds
like
your
dog
may
benefit
from
being
hospitalized
,
and
put
on
IV
fluids
to
help
his
hydration
,
administer
the
antibiotics
IV
,
and
to
ensure
that
he
starts
to
recover
.
You
should
ABSOLUTELY
call
your
veterinarian
back
immediately
to
clarify
anything
you
have
questions
about
.
They
have
seen
your
pet
,
and
are
most
aware
of
his
condition
.
No
one
online
will
be
able
to
assist
you
more
than
your
vet
can
.
You
need
to
ask
your
vet
these
questions
.
Boiled
WHITE
rice
and
boiled
chicken
breast
.
Bland
food
.
NO
SPICES
!
My
vet
told
me
when
a
dog
is
vomiting
a
lot
,
it
could
be
a
sign
of
obstruction
.
Did
they
do
any
x
-
rays
?
I
do
n't
know
if
vomiting
blood
is
common
with
this
ailment
.
You
should
call
your
vet
now
and
ask
them
what
is
normal
or
not
.
French
dating
etiquette
?
I
would
really
love
to
hear
what
the
French
or
those
who
had
dated
the
French
to
say
something
about
this
.
I
'm
in
my
20's
and
currently
studying
in
France
.
Coming
from
an
anglo
-
saxon
country
my
version
of
dating
is
'
getting
the
number
,
asking
her
out
,
etc.
.
'
However
,
I
've
read
on
the
internet
that
the
French
dating
etiquette
is
totally
different
.
For
them
,
dating
would
normally
be
meeting
in
groups
or
parties
,
then
pairing
off
.
In
addition
,
from
my
understanding
one
-
on
-
one
dates
is
something
that
comes
much
later
and
not
'
straight
-
away
'
like
us
anglo
-
saxons
.
They
are
also
very
secretive
about
being
in
a
relationship
.
They
only
'
go
out
in
the
open
'
once
they
have
reached
a
certain
level
of
seriousness
.
Is
it
true
?
I
have
told
a
French
girl
I
liked
her
,
and
she
accepted
.
She
is
friendly
when
we
see
each
other
on
campus
.
She
is
also
nicer
when
we
are
both
alone
.
However
,
when
we
are
at
parties
or
when
they
are
people
around
she
seems
to
ignore
me
.
She
also
seems
to
hate
it
whenever
I
ask
her
out
on
a
date
,
to
the
point
she
said
stop
!
My
mind
thinks
she
has
no
interest
in
me
and
just
stringing
me
along
.
But
the
articles
I
read
seemed
to
say
the
contrary
.
Have
I
just
fallen
victim
in
a
cultural
trap
?
What
you
have
read
in
the
internet
is
fairly
accurate
but
of
course
it
does
not
fit
all
scenarios
.
You
are
not
French
for
a
start
,
so
the
"
rules
"
or
"
customs
"
may
not
apply
to
you
when
it
comes
to
entering
into
a
relationship
between
people
from
different
backgrounds
.
From
what
you
say
the
messages
given
by
this
girl
are
quite
clear
.
She
is
not
stringing
you
along
since
she
is
actually
discouraging
you
and
is
honest
enough
to
tell
you
to
stop
asking
her
out
.
She
is
just
being
friendly
in
public
because
she
does
not
want
to
offend
you
and
she
treats
you
like
any
other
friend
.
You
said
you
liked
her
and
she
accepted
it
as
a
truth
and
perhaps
as
a
compliment
,
but
it
does
not
mean
she
fancies
you
or
wants
to
pair
off
with
you
.
At
parties
she
does
not
want
to
be
considered
in
any
way
attached
to
you
,
which
is
consistent
.
Take
the
messages
for
what
they
are
:
she
has
no
objection
in
you
being
pals
at
uni
,
but
she
does
not
want
to
take
matters
further
.
Non
!
means
"
non
"
,
not
"
I
might
consider
it
,
and
I
will
keep
you
attached
to
my
apron
strings
just
in
case
.
"
Christiane
gave
you
a
good
answer
.
You
have
fallen
in
a
cultural
misunderstanding
.
What
I
have
to
add
is
that
it
is
normal
in
France
to
have
mixed
gender
groups
of
friends
,
there
's
nothing
unusual
in
boys
and
girls
being
only
friends
,
which
is
obviously
what
this
girl
wants
from
you
.
She
probably
finds
your
company
pleasing
as
a
friend
but
you
are
not
her
choice
a
a
boyfriend
and
she
is
trying
to
keep
it
on
a
friendship
level
,
and
trying
to
make
you
understand
that
she
does
n't
want
to
go
further
.
If
she
is
nicer
when
you
are
alone
I
'd
say
it
is
because
in
public
view
she
is
making
sure
that
people
do
not
think
that
you
might
be
her
boyfriend
.
You
do
find
the
'
get
the
number
hop
in
bed
with
her
'
but
be
aware
that
they
usually
have
a
reputation
as
sluts
.
Unfair
for
the
girl
as
boys
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
handicap
,
but
that
's
the
way
our
own
rules
work
.
Should
have
done
research
before
you
left
.
Why
not
just
take
your
chances
and
do
it
your
way
?
True
or
false
:
being
a
young
New
Zealander
means
having
no
future
?
There
are
no
jobs
in
this
country
.
I
'm
just
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
should
move
to
Australia
or
seek
work
in
the
sex
industry
.
Is
there
a
future
for
our
nation
's
youth
?
@
Ryan
B
,
I
'm
two
years
into
an
undergraduate
degree
.
Everybody
I
know
at
university
intends
to
stay
at
uni
for
as
long
as
possible
until
there
are
actually
jobs
available
.
Everybody
seems
to
flee
this
country
and
move
overseas
,
to
Australia
,
etc
.
There
's
obviously
a
reason
for
that
(
lack
of
employment
,
low
incomes
,
etc
.
)
Your
answer
does
n't
do
anything
but
remind
me
that
I
'm
going
to
be
$
25,000
in
debt
by
the
time
I
'm
22
.
So
,
thanks
.
@
W.a.b.b.y
,
I
really
like
you're
answer
.
it
's
very
logical
.
I
've
also
considered
becoming
a
teacher
,
but
it
's
not
a
job
I
'm
cut
out
for
.
I
also
wish
I
'd
applied
for
a
scholarship
.
I
did
n't
think
I
'd
be
awarded
one
,
but
I
received
the
Dux
Litterarum
award
at
high
school
,
so
my
chances
were
probably
better
than
I
thought
they
were
.
Obviously
I
'm
still
completely
stupid
though
.
I
mean
,
I
was
n't
smart
enough
to
apply
for
a
scholarship
.
And
yes
,
I
am
being
melodramatic
.
Lol
.
@
Hatmanone
,

gasps

So
I
would
n't
make
a
good
prostitute
?
Are
you
saying
I
'm
bad
in
bed
?
How
would
you
know
?
Joking
.
Your
answer
is
very
sweet
,
but
I
'm
not
compassionate
towards
teenage
high
school
students
.
A
little
mellow
dramatic
?
In
my
opinion
,
far
too
many
people
are
at
university
studying
worthless
degrees
.
Yes
things
like
philosophy
and
fashion
design
are
interesting
,
but
how
many
jobs
are
out
there
for
someone
with
these
qualifications
?
I
'm
studying
to
be
a
teacher
,
so
I
know
that
there
will
definitely
be
jobs
out
there
when
I
'm
done
.
I
may
have
to
live
somewhere
rural
or
in
Auckland
,
but
at
least
I
can
be
pretty
sure
I
'll
be
employable
.
I
've
also
got
a
bachelor
s
degree
so
I
can
go
back
and
do
further
study
or
take
a
different
profession
.
I
also
know
that
you
do
n't
get
paid
that
much
more
in
Australia
than
you
do
here
.
And
it
's
not
all
about
how
much
you
earn
,
cost
of
living
is
much
higher
in
many
cities
in
Australia
.
Try
living
in
Sydney
on
a
teacher
's
salary
,
then
compare
it
to
somewhere
like
Central
Otago
.
You
also
have
to
put
up
with
all
the
annoying
accents
in
Australia
.
It
's
probably
not
a
wise
idea
to
keep
studying
and
having
a
massive
student
loan
.
At
the
moment
there
's
no
interest
,
but
that
'll
probably
change
.
And
they
'll
probably
add
interest
to
what
you
've
already
racked
up
.
And
they
're
working
towards
being
able
to
extradite
people
who
have
left
the
country
to
avoid
paying
it
back
.
At
the
moment
if
you
move
overseas
you
can
only
come
back
to
New
Zealand
for
a
short
amount
of
time
before
they
'll
force
you
cough
up
.
And
all
that
time
you
're
overseas
you
'll
be
racking
up
interest
.
I
would
n't
like
not
having
the
option
to
return
to
NZ
.
I
guess
I
'm
extremely
fortunate
that
I
received
a
scholarship
which
paid
about
800
f
my
course
fees
through
my
degree
.
But
I
worked
hard
and
I
'm
still
working
hard
.
There
are
far
too
many
lazy
people
out
there
who
think
that
they
can
sit
around
a
job
will
fall
in
their
lap

Get
an
education

I
'm
doing
fine
.
Whilst
youth
jobs
are
thin
on
the
ground
,
do
n't
assume
it
's
better
in
Oz
.
People
have
been
fleeing
this
country
at
roughly
a
plane
load
per
week
for
the
past
20
+
years
,
so
it
's
not
anything
new
.
It
depends
on
what
you
hunger
for
.
700
f
jobs
are
n't
advertised
.
That
means
making
yourself
known
;
that
means
networking
.
why
does
my
baby
king
snake
refuse
to
eat
?
i
have
a
baby
eastern
king
snake
.
i
have
tried
EVERYTHING
i
can
to
get
him
to
eat
but
he
refuses
.
he
has
a
great
environment
,
with
water
and
lots
of
hiding
places
and
a
heat
lamp
.
as
far
as
i
know
,
everything
is
as
good
as
it
can
be
where
his
aquarium
is
concerned
.
according
to
the
vet
,
he
is
healthy
and
looks
good
.
he
has
been
going
to
the
bathroom
like
he
should
.
(
i
know
that
snakes
that
have
problems
going
to
the
bathroom
wo
n't
eat
.
)
he
has
been
drinking
water
(
i
am
pretty
sure
he
has
been
drinking
it
out
of
his
bowl
,
but
also
i
have
been
feeding
him
water
and
he
does
n't
ever
give
me
a
problem
with
that
-
i
just
stick
his
head
near
the
water
and
he
sucks
it
down
.
)
i
handle
him
every
few
days
.
he
is
feisty
,
as
most
king
snakes
are
,
but
he
is
a
very
nice
little
guy
-
he
never
tries
to
bite
or
anything
.
i
just
love
him
to
death
.
i
do
n't
know
why
he
wo
n't
eat
though
!
i
have
tried
feeding
him
5
or
6
live
pinkies
and
4
or
5
frozen
(
thawed
)
pinkies
.
i
have
never
tried
feeding
him
a
pinky
that
was
bigger
around
than
he
is
.
i
have
tried
putting
him
in
a
small
container
and
putting
him
in
a
dark
place
for
an
hour
or
so
and
he
wo
n't
touch
the
pinky
.
he
crawls
on
top
of
them
but
does
not
try
to
eat
them
.
he
does
n't
seem
to
know
that
they
are
food
.
i
have
tried
"
braining
"
both
live
and
dead
pinkies
,
and
bloodying
them
up
to
get
his
attention
,
but
he
does
n't
care
.
i
have
tried
dipping
both
live
and
thawed
pinkies
in
tuna
juice
,
and
in
used
gerbil
bedding
.
i
have
bought
some
long
reptile
feeding
tweezers
and
have
tried
holding
the
pinky
in
front
of
the
snake
's
face
.
he
wo
nt
even
try
to
bite
.
i
am
very
discouraged
and
sad
and
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
he
has
n't
eaten
in
an
entire
month
.
i
've
only
tried
to
feed
him
one
at
a
time
.
he
's
just
a
tiny
baby
,
about
the
width
of
a
pencil
.
do
babies
this
small
hibernate
?
When
you
feed
him
how
many
pinkies
do
you
feed
him
?
If
you
feed
him
too
many
he
could
just
not
be
hungry
.
If
he
does
n't
seem
interested
in
them
at
all
I
would
say
he
's
just
not
hungry
.
My
boyfriend
has
one
and
when
she
's
hungry
she
attacks
the
pinkie
right
away
.
They
can
smell
it
so
i
'm
sure
he
knows
what
it
is
and
just
do
n't
want
it
.
Remember
snakes
can
go
a
while
without
eating
.
In
the
winter
,
they
will
usually
go
deep
underground
and
enter
a
hibernation
-
like
state
called
brumation
,
which
is
characterized
by
a
slowed
metabolism
and
reduced
activity
.
King
snakes
sometimes
stop
eating
,
particularly
during
the
cooler
part
of
the
year
.
They
have
a
natural
instinct
to
hibernate
.
If
the
snake
is
not
pregnant
or
shedding
,
and
its
enclosure
is
properly
equipped
,
a
loss
of
appetite
probably
signals
a
beginning
of
hibernation
.
Hibernation
is
natural
,
and
a
necessity
for
snakes
that
are
going
to
be
bred
.
Another
thing
that
can
cause
a
king
snake
to
stop
eating
is
shedding
.
You
can
tell
when
your
king
snake
is
about
to
shed
,
because
its
eyes
will
get
milky
looking
.
Its
body
will
be
dull
looking
,
too
.
In
a
few
days
the
snake
will
begin
to
shed
its
skin
.
For
example
,
some
snakes
will
routinely
go
off
their
food
in
both
the
summer
and
winter
,
feeding
mainly
in
spring
and
fall
.
It
's
natural
and
so
long
as
you
do
n't
see
any
serious
deterioration
in
their
health
is
nothing
to
worry
about
.
You
see
,
some
snakes
for
no
obvious
reason
will
simply
go
off
their
food
.
They
're
fit
and
healthy
and
their
care
is
suitable
.
hope
this
helped
.
That
's
why
it
's
good
to
have
a
python
!
It
's
twice
my
size
and
eats
a
rabbit
once
a
month
.
are
my
two
cats
fighting
or
playing
?
how
rough
is
too
rough
?
help
!?
i
have
a
1
and
a
half
year
old
male
neutered
cat
and
a
new
2
month
old
spayed
female
kitten
.
the
first
night
i
brought
her
home
i
did
the
sniffing
under
the
door
thing
and
left
it
at
that
.
the
next
day
i
let
her
out
of
the
bedroom
so
they
could
check
each
other
out
,
and
the
kitten
hissed
twice
within
the
first
20
minutes
of
meeting
each
other
and
now
she
no
longer
hisses
and
they
have
been
playing
(
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
the
hall
,
rolling
around
on
the
ground
and
pawing
at
each
other
)
.
only
once
it
looked
like
my
male
cat
was
biting
at
her
neck
and
then
her
stomach
and
she
was
meowing
fairly
loud
and
hissed
once
then
he
backed
off
and
now
they
are
fine
.
were
they
roughhouse
playing
?
or
were
they
actually
fighting
?
he
has
been
"
biting
"
at
her
neck
and
stomach
previously
while
they
play
without
her
meowing
or
anything
so
i
m
wondering
if
he
went
a
little
to
far
that
one
time
.
any
answers
help
!!!!!!
you
did
not
leave
the
new
kitten
in
the
room
long
enough
.
you
need
to
do
that
for
a
least
a
week
,
or
else
this
type
of
territorial
fighting
will
happen
.
giving
the
new
kitten
her
own
small
territory
will
help
her
to
feel
safe
and
will
give
her
a
place
to
go
to
when
scared
.
right
now
,
your
male
is
fighting
off
an
intruder
,
and
he
feels
that
all
of
the
house
is
his
.
put
her
back
in
the
room
,
and
keep
the
door
closed
for
a
week
.
then
let
her
out
for
ten
minutes
.
make
it
fifteen
the
next
day
,
then
twenty
,
and
so
on
.
this
will
do
two
things
;
the
new
kitten
will
rub
her
cheek
on
the
furniture
in
her
room
,
making
it
her
territory
.
she
will
start
to
calm
down
and
feel
safe
-
you
can
bet
she
does
n't
now
.
she
knows
she
is
invading
someone
else
's
territory
,
but
ca
n't
help
it
,
and
has
no
where
to
go
.
she
will
be
able
to
sleep
without
being
afraid
.
as
well
,
your
male
will
be
able
to
see
that
his
territory
is
not
threatened
.
when
the
door
opens
,
he
will
get
that
the
one
room
is
hers
,
and
he
will
be
OK
with
that
.
the
territory
thing
will
be
solved
.
your
male
is
hurting
her
to
put
her
in
her
place
-
biting
her
scruff
is
dominance
and
biting
the
belly
is
a
move
cats
use
when
hunting
-
to
pull
the
guts
out
of
their
prey
.
this
is
not
good
.
give
them
time
to
set
up
their
territories
,
and
once
you
bring
the
new
kitten
out
,
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
male
.
you
have
brought
someone
else
into
his
territory
,
and
he
needs
to
be
reminded
that
you
still
love
him
,
and
support
his
claim
to
his
space
.
that
will
help
to
reassure
him
,
and
he
will
be
less
aggressive
with
her
.
when
they
play
fight
,
they
do
n't
hiss
.
if
they
hiss
,
they
are
not
playing
.
if
they
bite
,
and
one
cries
,
you
must
separate
them
,
and
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
them
.
hissing
is
OK
,
unless
they
start
to
fight
.
if
that
happens
,
separate
them
,
and
give
them
time
apart
.
putting
the
girl
in
her
territory
will
make
her
feel
less
afraid
,
and
she
will
relax
.
good
luck
!
A
hiss
is
basically
a
"
get
the
f*ck
away
"
sound
.
It
means
they
've
gone
too
far
.
When
they
start
bleeding
that
means
they
're
really
fighting
.
If
they
're
going
kinda
slow
and
like
fake
biting
(
not
biting
as
hard
as
they
can
)
,
and
fake
scratching
(
not
hitting
as
hard
as
they
can
with
their
paws
)
then
they
're
playing
.
I
have
two
cats
,
and
at
first
they
hissed
at
each
other
because
cats
are
very
territorial
,
but
now
they
do
fight
and
play
.
The
difference
is
when
the
cat
hisses
,
that
means
they
are
annoyed
and
they
want
the
other
cat
to
go
away
.
That
means
they
are
fighting
.
When
they
are
just
jumping
at
each
other
and
their
tails
are
wagging
that
means
that
they
are
playing
.
I
can
see
how
you
get
confused
though
.
:)
What
was
the
goal
for
North
Vietnam
in
the
Tet
offensive
?
When
Johnson
deployed
troops
in
1964
he
was
advised
by
the
military
it
would
take
a
half
-
million
troops
about
ten
years
to
pacify
South
Vietnam
.
He
refused
to
believe
them
and
ordered
the
military
to
win
the
war
within
two
to
three
years
(
before
the
next
election
in
1968
)
.
He
did
not
give
them
the
number
of
troops
they
requested
.
This
left
Westmoreland
with
few
options
,
so
he
adapted
a
Search
and
Destroy
strategy
instead
of
a
Clear
and
Defend
strategy
which
is
,
in
the
long
run
,
the
preferred
method
of
pacifying
an
insurgency
.
Thing
is
,
it
worked
.
The
ARVN
was
not
having
a
big
problem
with
the
Local
VC
(
the
guerilla
movement
)
,
they
were
being
challenged
by
the
Main
Force
VC
(
which
was
light
infantry
)
and
the
North
Vietnamese
Army
(
NVA
)
.
When
the
Americans
swept
in
with
their
Search
and
Destroy
operations
the
Communists
quickly
leaned
they
could
not
stand
up
to
the
US
firepower
,
and
these
regular
troops
were
forced
to
flee
the
country
and
take
sanctuary
across
the
borders
in
Laos
and
Cambodia
.
All
those
sunny
reports
about
the
progress
in
Vietnam
were
correct
,
the
Communists
WERE
being
defeated
.
However
,
Johnson
would
not
let
the
military
cross
the
borders
and
clean
out
the
Communist
bases
.
He
was
warned
that
they
were
building
up
a
huge
Army
and
would
eventually
launch
an
attack
,
but
he
ignored
his
military
advisers
.
The
Communists
agreed
.
They
could
not
defeat
the
Americans
.
However
,
what
they
hoped
to
do
during
the
Tet
Offensive
was
to
sneak
past
the
Americans
and
attack
the
ARVN
in
the
urban
areas
where
they
were
deployed
doing
successful
Clear
and
Defend
operations
.
The
Communists
thought
they
could
defeat
the
ARVN
,
cause
the
fall
of
the
South
Vietnamese
government
,
and
the
people
would
than
rally
to
the
Communist
cause
and
leave
the
Americans
stranded
in
a
sea
of
angry
peasants
.
THAT
WAS
THE
PLAN
.
What
happened
?
The
Americans
detected
the
attempt
to
infiltrate
the
urban
areas
and
were
already
redeploying
troops
from
the
rural
areas
.
The
ARVN
rushed
back
from
holiday
leave
and
counterattacked
.
Within
24
hours
every
Communist
assault
had
been
defeated
except
in
the
ancient
capital
of
Hue
.
The
government
did
NOT
fall
.
And
the
South
Vietnamese
people
?
When
give
the
ultimate
choice
,
they
rallied
…
TO
THE
SOUTH
VIETNAMESE
GOVERNMENT
….
Tet
was
a
huge
military
and
political
disaster
for
the
Communists
.
They
were
chased
back
into
Laos
and
Cambodia
with
the
ARVN
in
hot
pursuit
.
The
people
rejected
their
attempt
to
topple
the
government
,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
US
military
(
and
the
ARVN
)
handed
Johnson
the
victory
he
had
ordered
them
to
achieve
within
the
time
-
frame
he
ordered
it
.
All
he
had
to
do
for
a
complete
victory
was
allow
the
military
to
go
into
Laos
and
Cambodia
and
finish
off
the
shattered
Communist
forces
.
But
Johnson
was
so
obtuse
he
did
n’t
understand
he
had
a
victory
when
it
was
handed
to
him
on
a
silver
platter
.
Instead
he
pulled
the
military
off
,
stopped
the
bombing
of
North
Vietnam
,
withdrew
from
the
presidential
race
,
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
term
in
office
trying
to
surrender
to
North
Vietnam
.
They
screwed
up
by
not
accepting
his
surrender
when
he
offered
it
.
The
American
people
were
NOT
having
any
of
it
,
and
elected
Richard
Nixon
to
fix
the
mess
LBJ
had
made
(
not
to
surrender
like
the
antiwar
movement
was
demanding
)
.
In
the
end
Nixon
kept
his
promise
for
“
…
peace
with
honor
….
”
But
that
’s
another
question
.
To
emancipate
the
south
,
but
it
was
a
serious
failure
.
To
make
the
war
unpalatable
to
the
American
public
.
In
that
,
they
pretty
much
succeeded
.
Before
Tet
,
the
war
was
unpopular
but
tolerable
to
the
majority
of
Americans
in
that
the
loss
of
American
lives
was
seen
as
the
cost
of
subduing
the
VC
and
NVA
.
Tet
made
it
clear
that
the
war
was
a
long
way
from
being
over
if
the
Americans
thought
they
could
preserve
the
South
and
that
the
North
was
perfectly
willing
to
suffer
great
losses
to
continue
their
fight
.
There
is
a
very
good
book
on
the
subject
that
was
written
by
General
Vo
Nguyen
Giap
.

to
find
the
title

Bearded
dragon
question
...
?
I
just
bought
a
baby
one
yesterday
.
I
have
a
basking
spot
lamp
that
says
it
is
a
double
reflector
that
focuses
35
%
more
light
/
heat
and
provides
beneficial
UVA
rays
important
to
the
psycholical
well
-
being
of
him
.
My
question
is
does
that
mean
it
gives
him
not
only
the
heat
,
but
the
"
sun
rays
"
he
needs
?
I
also
was
wondering
how
long
should
this
light
be
on
.

hours
,
but
on
places
on
the
net
it
says
10
to
12
hours
.
He
's
getting
used
to
his
new
home
,
but
has
n't
eatin
yet
.
I
have
bearded
dragon
juvenile
food
and
freeze
-
dried
crickets
.
Any
advice
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
Let
me
try
to
break
this
down
as
simply
as
I
can
:
diurnal
(
active
during
the
day
time
)
reptiles
like
the
bearded
dragon
require
3
types
of
"
light
,
"
UVA
,
UVB
,
and
heat
.
Any
white
light
emitting
light
source
will
emit
UVA
,
including
heat
bulbs
,
that
's
the
easy
one
to
provide
for
.
UVB
on
the
other
hand
can
only
be
reproduced
by
a
fluorescent
source
.
UVB
will
always
be
a
separate
bulb
from
the
heat
lamp
,
unless
you
use
a
MVB
(
mercury
vapor
bulb
)
which
is
the
only
reptile
use
bulb
that
will
emit
both
UVB
and
heat
from
one
bulb
.
I
highly
recommend
that
you
do
not
use
coiled
/
compact
UVB
bulbs
as
they
are
known
to
cause
severe
eye
damage
and
/
or
blindness
in
reptiles
not
to
mention
they
have
trouble
maintaining
UVB
output
over
time
.
The
long
tube
UVB
bulbs
are
best
,
like
Zoomed
's
Repsitun
model
:
http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/
Remember
to
replace
UVB
bulbs
according
to
the
manufacturer
s
recommendation
after
which
time
the
bulb
will
no
longer
produce
UVB
even
if
visible
light
still
is
.
So
,
to
answer
your
question
,
no
,
if
you
just
have
a
bulb
that
says
it
produces
UVA
then
you
do
not
have
"
the
sun
's
rays
"
that
your
bearded
needs
.
You
need
to
also
provide
a
source
a
UVB
lighting
.
The
person
at
Petsmart
is
very
wrong
;
in
fact
it
is
always
a
good
idea
to
second
guess
what
most
pet
store
employees
tell
you
;
they
do
n't
have
the
best
track
record
regarding
giving
reliable
pet
care
info
.
UVB
and
basking
temp
(
should
be
about
110
F
for
a
baby
,
95
F
for
an
adult
)
should
be
available
for
10
-
12
hours
a
day
.
Freeze
dried
food
is
not
a
good
staple
food
source
;
you
need
to
offer
live
feeder
insects
.
Bearded
dragons
are
sight
hunters
,
they
need
to
see
the
food
move
to
trigger
a
feeding
response
,
especially
when
they
are
babies
.
Live
food
is
also
higher
in
nutritional
value
than
freeze
dried
.
Crickets
,
silk
worms
,
phoenix
worms
,
and
various
feeder
roaches
,
like
red
-
lobster
,
turkistan
,
and
dubia
,
are
good
example
of
staple
insects
to
offer
your
bearded
.
Wax
worms
and
meal
worms
should
only
be
offered
as
treat
items
,
for
variety
's
sake
.
I
would
highly
recommend
that
you
read
through
some
reliable
bearded
guides
to
make
sure
you
have
everything
set
up
correctly
:
http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm
http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
mm
it
depends
on
the
size
of
his
tank
or
cage
or
whatever
you
have
him
in
..
atleast
as
far
as
i
'm
concerned
.
if
there
are
shady
areas
he
can
move
to
(
for
example
a
3
x
5
x
4
tank
with
light
on
one
side
)
then
you
can
leave
it
on
a
full
12
-
14
hours
,
if
it
s
a
small
tank
and
he
ca
n't
escape
the
light
then
4
-
6
at
most
at
a
time
though
quite
possibly
4
-
6
hours
at
a
time
twice
a
day
.
either
way
you
also
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
temperature
if
you
are
using
a
dry
fish
tank
as
UV
lights
in
my
experience
up
the
temperature
significantly
and
without
proper
ventilation
it
can
become
an
oven
.
as
to
what
the
light
provides
it
gives
UV
rays
..
which
is
important
for
health
in
lizards
as
it
is
in
humans
.
That
lady
at
PetSmart
is
a
disgrace
to
the
rest
of
us
PetSmart
associates
...
sheesh
.
Yes
,
it
gives
him
the
"
sun
rays
"
necessary
,
that
's
what
UVA
is
.
And
it
should
be
on
10
-
12
hours
,
just
like
the
sun
would
be
up
for
10
-
12
hours
in
his
natural
environment
.
As
for
the
heat
,
just
be
sure
to
use
a
thermometer
.
Also
,
Beardies
often
do
not
eat
food
that
is
not
moving
,
so
it
s
anyone
's
guess
whether
or
not
he
'll
touch
the
freeze
-
dried
crickets
or
the
processed
food
.
I
tell
all
my
customers
they
can
try
it
,
but
do
n't
count
on
it
.
Also
try
green
leafy
veggies
,
like
kale
and
spinach
.
Best
of
luck
!
Is
a
finch
or
a
parakeet
better
?
I
am
making
a
christmas
list
for
my
parents
and
i
was
going
to
ask
for
a
bird
and
these
are
the
affordable
ones
that
i
like
,
and
i
was
wondering
:
which
would
not
bite
alot
,
and
which
are
more
fun
to
have
as
pets
AND
I
NEED
TO
KNOW
WHICH
WOULD
BE
QUIETEST
i
honestly
do
nt
care
but
my
family
does
!
Please
help
me
!
oh
and
please
say
y
one
is
better
thx
!!!!!!
Hi
there
,
Please
choose
the
parakeet
...
Here
s
my
reason
.....
I
did
the
same
thing
that
you
did
for
christmas
.
I
ended
up
getting
a
pair
of
zebra
finches
for
christmas
.
At
first
it
was
all
cool
and
all
.
They
were
chirping
and
doing
their
every
day
business
.
After
a
couple
of
weeks
I
got
tired
of
them
.
They
are
quite
messy
and
you
can
not
hold
or
pet
them
.
I
ve
tried
to
tame
them
and
they
just
would
not
get
tamed
.
They
do
nt
want
to
be
held
or
touched
.
I
want
a
bird
that
I
can
hold
and
do
tricks
.
I
still
have
them
and
they
are
doing
well
.
A
couple
of
months
after
I
got
parakeets
/
budgies
.
They
are
adorable
they
have
beautiful
colors
and
personality
.
I
love
them
.
First
of
all
they
are
very
tame
.
I
tamed
them
in
4
days
.
They
can
do
tricks
and
they
are
nt
messy
.
The
whole
family
loves
them
.
My
parents
even
plays
with
them
.
They
are
a
big
part
of
our
family
.
I
hope
this
helps
you
with
your
decision
.
They
are
both
about
the
same
noise
level
.
When
choosing
a
parakeet
look
for
a
young
one
.
(
the
younger
the
eaiser
to
tame
)
Look
for
clean
smooth
feathers
,
beak
,
and
clean
vent
feathers
(
the
feathers
around
the
butt
..
dirty
vent
feathers
means
the
bird
is
not
healthy
)
Look
for
a
dark
eye
with
no
circles
(
the
older
ones
have
a
circle
ring
in
their
eyes
)
.
Look
for
a
lot
of
stripes
in
their
head
that
starts
from
the
beak
and
goes
back
to
the
back
fo
the
bird
.
the
stripes
are
like
hair
the
less
stipes
the
older
.
(
think
of
a
balding
man
lol
)
Look
for
clean
feathers
.
If
you
want
a
boy
the
cere
(
the
nostrils
piece
above
the
beak
)
must
be
blue
.
The
girl
has
either
pink
or
brown
.
I
would
recommend
that
you
get
two
parakeets
.
But
get
either
one
male
and
one
female
,
or
two
males
.
Do
not
get
two
females
.
They
sometimes
do
nt
get
along
(
you
know
how
some
girls
are
lol
hahahaahh
but
for
real
though
,
two
girls
tend
to
fight
a
lot
.
I
have
one
yellow
girl
and
a
green
and
yellow
boy
.
They
are
the
best
!
If
you
choose
to
get
a
parakeet
this
is
a
trick
that
I
used
to
tame
them
.
However
if
you
plan
on
getting
one
,
then
get
more
than
one
at
the
same
time
they
need
company
.
My
mom
told
me
how
to
tame
them
and
I
was
very
happy
with
the
results
.
It
took
me
4
days
to
get
the
new
one
to
be
able
to
step
on
and
eat
out
of
my
hand
.
These
are
the
steps
I
used
.
Honestly
they
have
worked
for
me
twice
with
my
parakeets
.
Hopefully
they
will
work
for
you
.
1
)
When
you
get
the
bird
,
place
him
or
her
or
them
in
the
cage
.
Leave
them
in
there
with
food
and
water
and
such
for
about
2
hours
.
2
)
Then
place
you
hand
in
the
cage
.
I
took
the
cage
and
place
it
next
to
the
couch
.
Then
I
sat
on
the
couch
,
placed
one
hand
in
the
cage
,
holding
a
millet
spray
.
(
this
way
the
will
associate
your
hand
with
food
,
and
birds
love
food
lol
)
Then
I
turned
on
the
tv
and
watch
.
This
way
they
will
see
that
your
hand
is
good
and
it
s
not
going
to
grab
them
or
hurt
them
.
Do
this
for
about
one
hour
.
(
you
can
take
breaks
if
you
have
too
)
and
repeat
the
steps
after
about
2
hours
.
3
)
After
about
day
2
,
they
will
start
to
eating
the
millet
spray
from
your
hand
.
(
do
not
take
away
the
food
dish
from
the
birds
,
they
will
associate
you
as
the
person
who
takes
away
their
food
)
....
Then
take
your
finger
and
place
it
under
their
belly
,
in
front
of
their
feet
and
say
up
.
Push
you
finger
to
their
feet
gently
and
say
up
.
(
the
first
couple
of
times
they
will
fly
all
over
the
cage
but
as
long
as
you
do
nt
jump
back
or
screem
they
will
get
used
to
you
)
They
will
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
your
finger
.
When
they
see
that
you
ar
nt
harming
them
,
the
will
go
up
on
your
finger
when
you
say
up
.
4
)
If
they
are
not
going
up
by
now
you
just
got
ta
keep
trying
and
keep
trying
.
Do
not
hit
,
yell
,
or
harm
them
.
You
have
patience
.
Do
nt
give
up
!
After
a
couple
of
weeks
mines
knows
when
I
say
shoulder
it
means
ot
go
on
my
sholder
,
when
I
say
up
it
means
to
jump
up
on
my
finger
,
when
I
say
up
and
out
it
means
up
on
my
finger
and
out
of
the
cage
.
and
when
I
say
go
home
it
means
to
go
in
the
cage
.
Good
luck
!
They
worked
for
me
and
I
hope
they
worked
for
you
!
They
are
awesome
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And
that
s
my
reason
why
you
should
choose
a
parakeet
over
a
finch
.
a
parakeet
is
friendlier
Parakeet
.
They
are
normally
quiet
and
it
is
easy
to
take
care
of
them
.
They
are
also
friendly
.
I
have
a
parakeet
named
Cookie
.
:P
When
is
the
best
time
to
travel
to
Ireland
?
My
sister
and
I
would
like
to
go
to
Ireland
.
I
graduate
in
the
spring
,
and
so
we
'd
like
to
go
between
then
and
winter
.
We
do
n't
want
too
many
tourists
,
and
since
we
'll
both
be
out
of
school
we
can
go
anytime
between
the
middle
of
June
to
early
November
.
We
do
n't
want
it
to
be
too
cold
(
not
sure
when
exactly
there
fall
is
...
or
what
the
weather
is
really
like
there
during
our
autumn
months
)
,
but
we
do
n't
feel
like
we
need
to
go
right
in
the
middle
of
summer
either
.
We
're
both
in
our
early
20s
and
just
wanting
to
explore
the
beautiful
country
while
we
're
still
young
and
before
our
lives
start
to
get
even
crazier
!
Can
anyone
give
me
an
idea
of
when
the
best
time
for
us
to
go
to
Ireland
would
be
?
People
do
not
go
to
Ireland
on
holiday
for
the
weather
,
it
is
unpredictable
.
One
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
about
Irish
weather
is
how
little
you
can
be
sure
of
.
It
may
be
shirtsleeves
and
sunglasses
in
February
,
but
winter
woollies
in
March
and
even
during
the
summer
.
And
then
there
’s
the
rain
.
Ireland
receives
a
lot
of
rain
,
with
certain
areas
getting
a
soaking
as
many
as
270
days
of
the
year
.
County
Kerry
is
the
worst
affected
.
The
southeast
is
the
driest
,
enjoying
a
more
continental
climate
.
The
Irish
weather
works
on
the
‘
four
seasons
in
a
day
’
principle
,
which
basic­ally
means
that
you
ca
n’t
predict
a
thing
when
it
comes
to
the
behaviour
of
the
sky
.
Some
basic
assumptions
,
however
,
can
be
made
.
In
summer
,
from
May
to
July
,
the
days
are
reasonably
warm
and
–
most
importantly
–
very
long
:
at
the
height
of
summer
you
wo
n’t
need
to
turn
on
lights
until
after
10
pm
.
It
is
also
peak
tourist
season
,
which
means
there
are
far
more
people
just
about
everywhere
but
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
island
,
and
prices
are
at
their
highest
.
Not
surprisingly
,
most
of
the
yearly
festivals
occur
during
these
times
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
the
crowds
and
the
more
favourable
weather
.
Spring
(
February
to
April
)
and
Autumn
(
August
to
October
)
make
good
alternatives
,
although
the
country
’s
ever
-
growing
popularity
as
a
tourist
destination
can
often
blur
the
lines
between
mid
-
and
high
-
season
tourism
.
Still
,
you
have
a
better
chance
of
some
peace
and
quiet
,
and
the
weather
can
be
surprisingly
better
in
April
and
September
than
in
mid-July
–
again
,
it
’s
all
part
of
the
uncertainty
principle
.
Spring
festivities
include
the
ever
-
popular
St
Patrick
’s
Festival
.
Although
temperatures
do
not
often
venture
below
freezing
,
winter
(
December
to
February
)
can
be
brutal
,
for
huge
parts
of
the
country
–
the
west
and
northwest
in
particular
.
Crowds
are
at
their
thinnest
,
but
many
of
the
country
’s
tourist
attractions
and
services
close
down
in
October
and
do
n’t
reopen
until
Easter
,
which
paradoxically
leaves
visitors
with
a
more
convincing
taste
of
how
Ireland
is
experienced
by
most
of
the
Irish
:
it
’s
cold
,
grey
and
dark
by
5
pm
,
but
there
’s
always
a
pub
to
escape
into
when
the
rain
starts
sheeting
down
.
The
thing
to
do
is
to
bring
the
right
clothing
with
you
,
clothes
so
you
can
layer
up
if
it
is
cold
and
take
off
layers
when
it
warms
up
.
Waterproof
clothing
and
footwear
are
essential
plus
an
umbrella
..
As
that
famous
Scotsman
Billy
Connolly
says
"
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bad
weather
just
the
wrong
clothes
"
Afraid
I
can
not
be
more
helpful
,
it
is
really
a
case
of
pot
luck
,
although
as
the
weather
is
so
changeable
often
a
cold
wet
morning
will
turn
into
a
lovely
warm
sunny
afternoon
and
evening
or
visa
versa
.
If
you
mean
the
Republic
of
Ireland
(
Dublin
)
then
anytime
.
The
summer
there
is
much
more
mild
than
most
of
the
US
(
are
you
coming
from
the
US
?
)
.
Their
seasons
are
the
same
as
all
the
countries
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
but
I
would
suggest
fall
.
It
does
get
pretty
cold
in
Ireland
so
going
before
winter
is
your
best
bet
.
September
for
example
.
Rent
a
car
and
spend
a
couple
days
outside
of
Dublin
seeing
the
countryside
and
you
will
have
the
trip
of
a
lifetime
.
To
explore
the
beautiful
countryside
you
will
need
to
be
old
enough
to
hire
a
car
because
public
transport
is
expensive
&
only
goes
as
far
as
the
main
towns
/
cities
,
most
rural
places
do
n't
have
a
bus
or
train
service
.
You
could
stay
in
a
city
&
get
a
bus
tour
to
say
the
Cliffs
of
Moher
or
Dingle
peninsula
but
you
will
be
with
all
the
other
tourists
.
By
definition
most
tourists
will
go
to
the
best
places
so
you
might
have
to
put
up
with
a
few
tourists
along
the
way
.
Best
weather
the
past
couple
of
years
has
been
around
late
April
-
late
May
but
it
can
pour
with
rain
for
days
on
end
at
any
time
of
the
year
so
be
prepared
with
waterproof
jackets
/
boots
etc
.
We
only
had
a
few
sunny
days
this
summer
,
barely
24
C
on
a
few
occasions
,
more
like
14
C
most
days
.
We
used
our
BBQ
on
precisely
4
occasions
.
Autumn
is
from
mid
August
onwards
as
far
as
the
weather
goes
if
not
officially
according
to
the
calender
.
The
days
start
to
shorten
&
it
gets
even
wetter
,
windier
&
colder
.
We
had
frosts
in
October
so
I
would
n't
advise
visiting
late
in
the
year
to
be
honest
,
Spring
time
is
your
best
bet
.
You
do
realise
it
is
quite
expensive
to
visit
Ireland
?
You
are
going
to
need
a
few
thousand
dollars
saved
up
for
flights
,
insurance
,
food
,
accommodation
&
spending
money
.
Eating
out
in
particular
is
quite
expensive
compared
to
America
I
believe
.
Golden
Wonder
KilliFish
Breeding
Help
?
I
have
4
Golden
Wonder
Killifish
.
1
of
them
is
really
colorful
and
is
about
6
cm
long
.
2
of
them
are
kinda
whitish
and
are
about
4
-
5
cm
long
.
The
last
one
is
colourful
too
but
it
is
about
4
cm
long
.
I
feed
them
Flakes
,
and
Live
Earthworms
uncut
everyday
.
Can
you
tell
me
the
whole
process
of
breeding
them
and
taking
care
of
the
babies
?
Thanks
in
Advance
.
Wow
!
If
they
are
able
to
take
earthworms
uncut
,
that
is
really
impressive
!
I
aspire
to
your
feeding
regime
,
flakes
early
and
something
live
later
in
the
day
.
Worms
(
and
Daphnia
)
are
also
rich
in
Lipids
,
substances
important
in
forming
eggs
and
growing
young
.
I
think
that
you
understand
that
your
largest
and
smallest
golden
wonders
are
males
.
If
you
would
like
more
on
sexing
out
Aplocheilus
lineatus
take
a
look
at
the
discussion
in
the
first
source
below
.
If
you
have
plants
in
your
tank
.
your
lineatus
are
already
spawning
.
If
conditions
are
favorable
(
78
-
82
F
)
and
the
fish
are
obviously
well
fed
as
yours
are
,
they
will
spawn
.
(
I
've
even
had
a
pair
of
killies
leave
eggs
on
a
floating
thermometer
!
If
you
wish
to
pick
eggs
make
a
acrylic
spawning
mop
.
Check
out
the
second
source
.
I
prefer
darker
colors
because
I
can
see
their
eggs
,
more
easily
and
the
fish
look
better
next
to
them
.
Use
a
well
rinsed
medicine
vial
,
a
cork
,
new
fishing
bobber
or
even
a
piece
of
non-crumbly
styrofoam
to
float
them
.
There
are
a
couple
ways
one
could
spawn
lineatus
-
mop
spawning
&
water
incubating
them
for
two
weeks
,
picking
eggs
from
a
mop
&
putting
them
in
a
tray
of
treated
,
seasoned
water
or
setting
up
the
parents
in
a
planted
tank
&
moving
them
so
the
fry
can
hatch
out
there
.
If
you
have
the
room
to
separate
the
male
(
s
)
&
females
(
s
)
,
&
feed
them
well
on
live
foods
,
(
assuming
that
you
are
doing
weekly
50
%
water
changes
)
when
you
put
them
together
they
will
leave
a
lot
more
eggs
.
Just
making
up
examples
,
but
if
a
pair
is
constantly
together
,
they
may
lay
10
-
15
eggs
a
day
.
With
extra
blackworms
and
maybe
frozen
(
defrosted
,
rinsed
)
frozen
foods
earlier
in
the
day
,
they
may
leave
30
-
40
eggs
at
a
time
.
Separated
and
feed
extremely
nourishing
stuff
,
they
may
produce
more
.
Separating
a
pair
some
time
before
a
show
(
killies
are
usually
shown
&
judged
&
often
sold
as
pairs
)
will
encourage
them
to
court
and
show
their
best
colors
.
They
also
start
the
day
with
no
nicks
or
dings
in
their
fins
.
The
water
changes
help
with
that
too
.
You
also
may
need
to
treat
the
incubation
water
.
The
chlorine
and
ammonia
(
choramine
)
are
not
good
for
the
eggs
.
Ironically
sometimes
it
is
wise
to
leave
the
newly
picked
eggs
in
fresh
tap
water
with
some
chlorination
to
kill
microscopic
critters
that
ride
in
with
the
eggs
.
THEN
put
the
eggs
in
water
treated
a
couple
of
days
before
with
a
water
treatment
and
left
open
to
"
breathe
"
.
Leaving
a
jar
with
a
dozen
black
worms
in
it
will
sate
the
adult
's
desire
for
snacks
and
they
are
more
likely
to
leave
fry
or
eggs
alone
.
If
a
pair
is
n't
leaving
eggs
...
check
the
following
:
1
.
Is
a
tank
mate
(
such
as
another
female
killie
or
a
Cory
or
large
snails
)
rating
the
eggs
?
2
.
Have
we
kept
up
with
partial
water
changes
?
3
.
Is
there
too
much
mineral
in
the
water
?
Aplo.
lineatus
are
wide
-
spread
over
southern
India
.
That
indicates
that
they
thrive
in
different
water
chemistries
.
Still
if
you
can
get
your
pet
shop
to
do
a
hardness
or
TDS
(
total
Dissolved
Solids
)
test
,
that
may
give
you
a
hint
.
Winging
it
a
little
here
,
a
hardness
of
100
to
nearly
200
PPM
(
parts
per
million
)
or
5.8
to
10.6
DH
should
be
fine
for
gardneri
.
TDS
meters
(
the
thrifty
aquarist
's
hardness
meter
can
be
used
if
one
has
seen
one
of
your
municipal
water
department
's
annual
reports
.
They
include
a
number
of
minerals
there
and
you
can
figure
out
what
percentage
of
that
would
be
your
hardness
minerals
(
calcium
,
magnesium
and
iron
)
.
A
number
of
minerals
are
not
of
much
consequence
.
However
if
there
is
a
high
level
of
sodium
chloride
(
common
salt
)
that
can
break
down
the
chorion
(
shell
)
around
the
egg
and
allow
critters
to
get
in
and
eat
the
yoke
and
embryo
.
)
Ironically
sometimes
it
is
wise
to
newly
picked
eggs
in
fresh
tap
water
with
some
chlorination
to
kill
microscopic
critters
that
ride
in
with
the
eggs
.
THEN
put
the
eggs
in
water
treated
a
couple
of
days
before
with
a
water
treatment
and
left
open
to
"
breathe
"
.
If
you
get
eggs
in
the
mail
in
a
medicine
vial
,
that
is
fine
.
But
get
the
eggs
out
,
maybe
rinsed
in
fresh
tap
water
and
then
into
the
incubation
water
.
In
time
the
eggs
can
suffocate
in
the
shipping
container
.
After
a
number
of
people
began
complaining
about
"
mystery
deaths
"
among
incubating
eggs
,
some
of
the
more
advanced
killie
people
began
suggesting
that
after
7
-
8
days
of
incubation
,
one
should
do
a
100
%
water
change
-
as
the
eggs
develop
,
they
do
release
waste
material
.
Another
problem
is
that
sometimes
bad
eggs
will
fungus
and
the
fungus
will
spread
out
and
kill
all
the
eggs
.
Some
people
put
in
a
very
dilute
Acriflaven
solution
to
slow
down
the
fungus
,
so
one
can
take
white
eggs
out
with
a
pipette
or
eyedropper
.
Other
will
add
a
drop
of
Methylene
blue
.
If
an
egg
turns
blue
,
it
had
died
and
then
became
dyed
as
the
outer
membrane
broke
down
.
Get
those
out
ASAP
too
.
Hope
there
is
useful
grist
for
the
mill
here
.

It
is
vacation
time
.
Many
families
are
set
to
plan
a
best
holidaying
.
They
look
for
fun
filled
,
rejuvenating
and
memorable
vacation
.
There
can
be
many
ideas
;
one
can
see
numerous
options
passing
through
their
mind
.
What
is
the
best
option
?
Especially
if
you
are
planning
to
spend
couple
days
with
family
and
kids
,
which
best
suit
you
can
select
?
Disney
cruises
,
is
a
simple
answer
to
this
.
There
are
many
reasons
to
say
Disney
cruise
is
the
best
bet
for
you
to
have
a
enjoyable
holiday
tour
.
From
1998
onwards
,
from
its
inception
Disney
cruise
has
attracted
many
and
continue
to
attract
more
and
more
.
This
is
a
spectacular
ship
,
a
very
popular
choice
of
families
to
spend
their
leisure
time
.
The
ship
is
designed
thematically
,
with
imposing
animated
cartoon
characters
.
Do
you
feel
that
the
holidaying
with
the
animated
cartoons
will
impress
only
young
ones
?
No
,
the
luxurious
facilities
and
fun
filled
activities
in
the
Disney
cruise
are
very
attractive
to
people
of
all
ages
.
Whatever
be
the
age
,
you
will
have
the
choice
of
variety
of
activities
to
forget
about
your
hectic
day
-
to
-
day
activities
.
Kids
fun
games
and
video
shows
are
added
to
the
other
facilities
.
There
are
two
ships
,
Disney
magic
and
Disney
wonder
.
Both
are
made
keeping
in
mind
the
comforts
of
the
travelers
.
Disney
cruises
offer
24
-
hour
room
services
,
and
the
crews
are
ready
to
serve
you
the
way
you
like
.
It
has
got
very
spacious
rooms
,
furnished
completely
and
neatly
.
These
are
decorated
uniquely
and
marvelously
.
The
ship
offers
variety
of
eatables
,
deliciously
made
.
Sea
fishes
,
prawns
and
many
nice
options
are
there
in
different
restaurants
aboard
.
There
are
many
good
options
of
delicious
food
on
the
shores
as
well
.
There
are
special
regions
uniquely
and
imposingly
designed
for
the
children
.
They
can
spend
many
hours
enjoying
the
Disney
world
magic
.
These
theme
parks
have
all
types
of
facilities
.
Video
shows
,
cartoon
stories
,
wonderful
games
and
many
such
facilities
.
It
is
really
an
entertainment
for
the
kids
.
The
amusing
world
of
cartoons
and
stories
will
be
a
memorable
experience
for
the
children
.
There
are
other
amnesties
also
.
These
include
space
for
dances
and
music
,
bar
facility
,
gambling
facilities
for
the
elder
,
spaciously
made
open
area
aboard
and
many
such
nice
facilities
.
Also
one
can
keep
their
privacy
in
the
cabins
and
make
the
time
in
seclusion
.
To
relax
and
to
rejuvenate
Disney
cruise
are
the
best
option
.
There
are
many
online
sites
offering
the
booking
facility
with
affordable
rates
.
You
can
select
the
proper
route
and
travel
plans
by
consulting
the
agents
prior
to
the
booking
........
Off
season
is
good
,
however
,
the
Disney
cruises
are
almost
ALWAYS
completely
booked
.
I
would
suggest
a
warmer
season
,
but
not
Spring
Break
or
early
summer
.
You
may
also
want
to
avoid
Thanksgiving
week
and
the
Christmas
holidays
.
We
REALLY
enjoyed
our
balcony
--
coffee
in
the
mornings
,
drinks
at
night
,
standing
outside
when
docking
and
leaving
port
--
however
,
it
is
quite
a
bit
more
expensive
.
With
young
ones
,
I
would
definitely
get
a
window
or
view
room
so
they
can
see
outside
.
Check
out
the
kids
'
space
as
soon
as
you
get
onboard
.
Do
NOT
feel
guilty
about
taking
them
there
.
They
have
a
BLAST
so
the
sooner
they
get
there
,
the
sooner
they
can
have
fun
.
We
liked
getting
the
late
dinner
seating
,
so
you
have
more
time
to
see
movies
and
stuff
but
if
your
kids
are
'
early
to
bed
'
you
may
want
the
earlier
seating
for
dinners
.
Bring
some
sort
of
magnet
or
small
magnetic
whiteboard
for
your
door
.
All
of
the
doors
tend
to
look
alike
and
having
'
something
'
on
your
door
helps
you
and
your
kids
find
your
room
easier
.
You
can
also
leave
notes
for
the
rest
of
your
family
(
husband
)
about
where
you
are
at
any
given
point
.
Cell
phones
do
NOT
work
on
board
but
they
give
you
a
'
walkie
-
talkie
'
kind
of
phone
in
your
room
that
WILL
work
onboard
.
Each
evening
you
will
get
a
'
magazine
'
called
The
Navigator
which
lists
all
of
the
activities
for
the
next
day
.
We
always
took
ours
to
dinner
and
discussed
what
things
we
felt
we
'
had
'
to
do
and
which
ones
we
felt
like
skipping
in
lieu
of
just
chilling
.
Any
time
would
be
great
.
off
season
cruises
might
actually
be
better
with
preschoolers
as
prices
might
be
lower
in
the
off
season
.
My
wife
and
I
,
in
our
60's
at
the
time
,
originally
planned
a
3
generation
trip
but
some
family
emergencies
caused
everyone
else
to
cancel
.
We
had
a
ball
.
We
had
an
inside
cabin
and
it
is
what
I
would
recommend
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
do
that
you
will
only
use
your
room
for
sleeping
and
the
extra
cost
of
the
balcony
is
wasted
.
The
children
can
be
checked
in
and
checked
out
in
a
safe
way
at
many
activities
so
you
can
have
a
bit
of
free
time
without
the
little
ones
.
The
range
of
activities
can
be
illustrated
by
describing
the
water
activities
.
There
is
a
splash
fountain
(
no
standing
water
)
for
little
ones
still
in
diapers
;
Next
is
a
wading
pool
for
those
who
are
potty
trained
;
Then
a
family
pool
;
Finally
there
is
a
pool
for
adults
only
with
kids
not
allowed
.
You
will
never
be
so
spoiled
in
your
life
as
you
are
on
a
Disney
Cruise
.
If
you
stay
with
your
dining
schedule
,
every
night
is
dinner
and
a
show
.
The
real
payoff
is
that
you
will
have
the
same
waiter
for
the
entire
cruise
.
Our
waiter
quickly
grasped
the
fact
that
I
like
Ginger
ale
and
rather
spicy
foods
while
my
wife
's
taste
ran
to
lemonade
and
less
spicy
fare
.
Since
they
knew
our
preferences
,
we
almost
always
went
along
with
their
menu
suggestions
and
were
never
sorry
we
did
.
Obviously
they
had
a
full
beverage
list
including
alcohol
for
adults
who
wanted
it
.
If
you
should
miss
a
meal
,
you
also
missed
a
great
show
.
but
food
is
always
available
and
it
is
consistently
good
.
I
think
I
gained
three
pounds
in
my
week
long
cruise
.
This
is
about
my
farrier
,
girls
.
That
's
why
I
'm
posting
here
!
Help
?
I
posted
this
in
singles
and
dating
too
,
so
I
've
just
copied
and
pasted
.
Well
,
I
'll
try
to
make
this
short
.
I
have
known
this
guy
for
a
long
time
,
but
we
've
never
been
good
friends
or
anything
.
He
is
my
farrier
(
shoes
my
horse
s
feet
)
so
I
am
technically
a
client
if
you
want
to
view
it
that
way
.
Well
,
almost
two
weeks
ago
he
came
out
and
did
my
horse
s
feet
and
was
SO
flirty
.
He
always
hugs
me
when
he
comes
,
but
he
gave
me
at
least
5
tight
,
long
,
back
rubbing
hugs
while
he
was
there
.
We
were
also
just
talking
about
my
horse
's
crappy
feet
and
he
mentioned
.
Well
,
if
you
ever
just
want
to
see
me
I
'll
come
out
and
look
him
over
and
then
we
can
grab
a
coffee
after
.
That
has
NEVER
happened
before
so
I
was
kinda
realizing
at
that
point
that
he
was
a
little
interested
.
Right
??
Anyway
,
so
he
ended
up
leaving
one
nail
out
of
my
horse
s
foot
(
I
've
never
heard
of
a
farrier
doing
this
)
and
telling
me
to
call
him
in
a
few
days
(
first
it
was
a
week
,
then
it
was
a
few
days
lol
)
and
he
'd
come
back
out
and
put
it
in
.
He
told
me
to
remember
to
call
like
3
times
before
he
left
.
So
,
I
waited
a
week
to
call
because
I
was
busy
and
I
wanted
to
have
him
come
out
on
a
day
when
I
am
more
available
in
case
we
were
to
hang
out
after
;)
Anyway
,
so
that
was
2
days
ago
that
I
called
and
left
a
message
,
but
he
still
has
n't
called
back
yet
.
I
do
n't
know
if
I
should
call
him
again
tomorrow
or
not
?
I
know
a
lot
of
people
say
to
wait
until
he
calls
you
,
but
it
's
different
because
I
'm
a
client
and
technically
that
's
all
I
am
at
this
point
.
On
the
other
hand
though
,
if
I
'm
a
client
he
should
really
of
called
back
by
now
because
you
do
n't
leave
a
customer
hanging
.
He
did
n't
have
my
number
either
because
this
was
the
first
time
I
've
called
HIM
instead
of
his
dad
.
It
's
a
father
and
son
business
.
Anyway
,
I
would
appreciate
ANY
insight
on
this
at
all
.
Thank
you
for
reading
if
you
did
!
:)
Ok
,
well
as
far
as
him
being
a
bad
farrier
for
leaving
a
nail
out
-
That
is
not
the
case
,
they
are
extremely
well
known
farriers
in
the
area
.
I
would
be
a
lot
more
concerned
if
the
shoe
fell
off
because
it
was
missing
one
lousy
nail
.
The
reason
he
said
he
did
n't
put
that
nail
in
was
because
he
"
did
n't
want
to
risk
it
"
with
my
horse
's
horrible
feet
.
This
is
about
the
fourth
time
they
've
done
my
horse
's
feet
because
I
just
switched
back
to
them
.
The
only
reason
I
switched
away
from
them
in
the
first
place
is
because
my
good
friend
who
apprenticed
with
them
was
starting
out
on
his
own
.
However
,
he
left
my
horse
without
a
shoe
for
TWO
WEEKS
(
now
that
's
what
I
call
a
crap
farrier
)
.
Which
,
I
might
add
is
the
same
foot
that
keeps
crumbling
with
the
nails
.
So
,
obviously
I
switched
back
to
these
guys
.
Ok
,
calm
down
,
it
's
not
like
he
's
some
stranger
that
came
up
and
groped
me
lol
.
I
've
known
the
guy
for
about
10
years
.
I
am
21
,
so
yeah
we
were
both
kids
when
we
knew
each
other
!
He
is
a
few
years
older
than
me
.
And
yes
,
I
do
like
him
.
To
answer
Barry
White
,
yes
that
did
occur
to
me
:)
I
hope
that
is
all
he
's
waiting
for
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
could
very
easily
just
call
me
and
say
hey
I
'm
busy
right
now
,
I
'll
call
you
when
I
can
come
out
.
And
as
far
as
scheduled
visits
go
,
I
have
no
idea
.
I
've
never
done
that
before
though
either
.
It
's
always
just
"
Okay
,
they're
feet
need
to
be
done
,
better
call
the
farrier
.
"
And
they
usually
come
out
within
a
few
days
.
He
will
call
you
back
I
m
sure
!
Sounds
like
He
really
likes
you
..
But
you
need
to
ask
yourself
do
you
feel
the
same
way
?
would
You
like
going
for
*
coffee
*
with
him
?
or
is
he
Not
your
type
?
Or
are
you
undecided
?
If
i
were
you
I
would
Go
...
I
would
say
if
he
does
not
call
you
back
by
friday
call
him
again
he
could
be
playing
hard
to
get
?
I
think
he
left
the
Nail
out
of
the
shoe
as
a
excuse
to
come
back
and
see
you
hey
he
may
be
your
Prince
charming
..
Edit
...
I
really
do
nt
think
Your
horse
Is
in
danger
Of
being
hurt
With
one
Nail
missing
..
I
have
seen
horses
Loose
Nails
On
there
Own
And
do
just
fine
with
ONE
nail
gone
Now
if
he
had
left
out
2
or
3
I
would
be
wondering
to
...
I
really
do
belive
he
left
the
nail
out
becuse
of
the
horse
s
Hoof
condition
and
It
s
a
added
bonus
he
would
get
to
see
her
again
When
I
was
Younger
In
my
early
20s
My
farrier
was
A
hottie
named
Joby
..
(
for
those
who
do
n't
Know
I
AM
A
GIRL
read
my
Bio
on
my
Page
)
dumb
as
a
post
about
everything
But
horses
..
He
was
In
his
30s
divorced
and
Had
2
kids
..
but
we
both
flirted
Horribly
with
each
other
..
but
neither
one
of
us
took
the
chance
and
Asked
to
other
on
a
date
.
:(
sort
a
wonder
what
it
would
have
been
like
?
But
That
was
Years
ago
.
He
had
this
Habit
of
telling
you
Everything
..
Well
one
day
he
said
to
me
You
know
i
do
n't
wear
Underwear
as
he
was
bent
over
Working
on
my
Mare
s
Right
front
hoof
..
and
I
was
Like
Ummmm
okay
???
I
m
glad
his
butt
was
facing
me
so
he
could
n't
see
my
red
face
I
think
my
Mare
was
even
laughing
..
Well
6
weeks
Later
when
he
came
back
out
He
was
again
working
on
my
mare
s
front
Foot
and
I
looked
Down
and
Yeah
he
had
Wholes
In
his
pants
In
the
wrong
places
I
bust
out
Laughing
and
He
was
like
what
???
I
was
like
Ummmm
i
can
see
your
ass
cheeks
...
he
was
like
Oops
did
i
forget
my
Underwear
???
that
was
a
strange
way
to
flirt
..
but
i
guss
it
was
his
way
...
But
like
i
said
nothing
ever
came
of
It
..
the
next
time
I
saw
him
He
had
told
Me
he
had
To
get
married
to
a
girl
Who
he
worked
with
becuse
he
knocked
Her
Up
..
I
was
heartbroken
..
but
then
realized
He
was
not
the
Guy
for
me
..
Wow
he
does
sound
interested
in
you
,
my
farrier
never
gives
me
hugs
like
that
(
probably
a
good
thing
as
he
has
a
wife
and
2
kids
)
anyway
,
I
find
that
they
can
be
very
busy
so
I
would
wait
a
week
lo9nger
and
if
still
no
reply
give
him
a
call
but
do
n’t
leave
a
message
so
you
do
n’t
have
to
necessarily
wait
for
him
to
call
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
a
business
,
and
client
/
operator
relationships
,
he
's
doing
a
really
shitty
job
.
Leaving
nails
out
so
you
'll
call
and
have
him
come
back
out
later
?
Cute
or
not
,
I
'd
call
a
different
bloke
because
he
's
doing
a
sub-par
job
at
something
he
needs
to
be
doing
his
best
at
,
whether
he
's
flirting
or
trying
to
ask
you
out
or
not
,
he
ought
to
put
quality
first
.
This
is
,
after
all
,
his
business
,
and
if
he
wants
you
to
remain
a
customer
why
on
earth
is
he
doing
shoddy
work
?
EPM
,
Anyone
Dealt
with
it
?
Might
be
something
different
?
I
have
the
opportunity
to
pick
up
a
super
nice
6
year
old
for
free
.
He
's
not
lame
,
but
he
's
been
having
issues
.
Here
's
what
the
owner
has
said
:
I
have
a
5
year
old
that
lost
all
of
his
cheek
muscle
on
the
right
side
about
3
-
4
months
ago
.
I
chalked
it
up
to
possible
nerve
damage
,
because
this
is
what
the
vet
thought
and
the
other
cheek
muscle
was
fine
and
he
had
no
theeth
problems
.
So
I
sent
him
to
the
trainers
the
first
of
September
to
be
started
on
the
barrels
.
I
got
him
back
the
first
of
the
month
and
he
had
lost
some
weight
but
attributed
that
to
be
worked
everyday
(
I
expected
him
to
drop
some
)
.
He
is
now
losing
the
cheek
muscle
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
and
seems
to
be
dropping
weight
by
the
day
.
Had
him
to
a
dentist
yesterday
and
there
is
no
teeth
problems
.
He
can
eat
all
his
feed
and
does
n't
drop
any
,
but
can
not
eat
hay
from
lack
of
muscle
to
chew
it
.
He
is
gant
looking
in
his
flank
area
and
is
losing
topline
muscle
.
The
only
neurological
sign
that
he
shows
is
that
he
barely
drags
his
toes
and
sometimes
has
trouble
with
his
right
lead
.
The
horse
I
had
posted
about
a
couple
weeks
ago
with
the
atrophied
cheek
muscles
is
down
to
his
last
resort
for
life
.
I
CAN
NOT
afford
to
treat
whatever
is
wrong
with
him
.
NO
,
I
have
not
done
an
EPM
test
but
have
done
an
extensive
blood
panel
and
my
vet
did
a
neurological
physical
exam
.
We
elected
to
not
do
the
EPM
test
because
there
was
NO
neurological
signs
.
He
is
still
showing
no
signs
other
than
the
weight
loss
,
and
some
muscle
atrophy
.
He
eats
all
of
his
grain
but
it
just
takes
him
a
while
to
get
it
chewed
because
of
the
lack
of
muscle
in
his
jaws
.
So
I
might
get
the
horse
and
see
what
I
can
do
.
I
will
be
getting
with
my
vet
first
and
if
I
do
get
him
,
have
the
spinal
fluid
test
done
for
EPM
and
a
titer
test
.
Will
be
getting
a
copy
of
the
blood
results
the
owner
has
already
ran
as
well
.
My
other
theory
would
be
wobblers
.
I
'll
be
having
my
equine
chiro
/
acupuncturist
out
to
do
some
work
as
well
if
I
do
get
him
....
So
any
ideas
?
Think
I
should
do
it
?
Arby
,
Horse
is
out
of
state
and
not
local
.
Owner
is
willing
to
meet
me
half
way
with
him
.
I
will
be
calling
my
vet
and
chiro
about
him
.
Worse
comes
to
worse
,
I
'm
out
of
the
$
$
and
have
to
put
him
down
anyway
or
have
a
pretty
pasture
ornament
.
He
's
still
rideable
currently
and
not
having
many
issues
under
saddle
.
This
is
a
horse
that
I
otherwise
would
n't
be
able
to
afford
and
even
if
I
spend
2
K
and
treatment
I
come
out
ahead
of
his
purchase
price
.
I
posted
what
the
owner
as
said
in
paragraph
2
&
3
,
that
is
not
me
to
clarify
.
She
is
the
one
that
ca
n't
afford
to
do
anything
else
for
him
in
case
he
does
n't
recover
fully
.
He
can
eat
grain
and
I
already
have
a
feed
regimen
in
my
head
for
the
guy
since
he
ca
n't
eat
regular
hay
.
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
hard
to
keep
his
weight
up
so
long
as
he
can
eat
the
grain
.
I
am
not
going
to
go
pick
up
a
horse
I
ca
n't
afford
.
I
am
willing
to
pull
the
EPM
test
and
treat
.
The
owner
is
the
one
who
is
unable
.
I
will
also
be
having
my
other
vet
up
who
's
a
chiro
&
acupuncturist
to
evaluate
him
for
wobblers
.
July
is
when
he
started
to
exhibit
slight
symptoms
and
the
owner
and
vet
originally
thought
it
was
just
some
nerve
damage
from
something
in
the
pasture
with
no
visible
injury
.
He
's
only
exhibited
weight
loss
and
some
muscle
atrophy
,
with
the
slight
toe
drag
and
a
bit
of
trouble
with
the
right
lead
(
which
could
or
could
n't
be
related
)
.
The
horse
is
not
in
pain
.
He
's
not
starving
.
He
's
dropping
we
The
horse
is
not
in
pain
.
He
's
not
starving
.
He
's
dropping
weight
,
but
most
of
that
came
from
being
at
the
trainer
s
and
being
ridden
hard
for
60
days
.
He
's
not
putting
it
back
on
.
I
know
that
I
have
the
possibility
of
treating
him
and
still
having
to
put
him
down
.
At
the
same
time
I
do
know
people
who
have
had
horses
come
back
successfully
after
EPM
.
I
know
this
is
going
to
be
expensive
.
I
'm
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
.
Gallop
,
I
've
already
read
that
whole
site
and
been
reading
through
research
articles
from
the
research
colleges
as
well
.
Looked
at
studies
,
treatment
options
and
such
.
I
will
have
the
EPM
test
done
before
treating
.
The
chiro
/
acupuncturist
will
be
there
to
evaluate
the
horse
for
wobblers
which
is
often
caused
by
spinal
compression
and
can
be
confused
with
EPM
.
If
that
is
the
case
then
acupuncture
is
n't
going
to
hurt
him
.
It
's
actually
one
of
the
alternative
therapies
for
EPM
I
think
it
is
wonderfully
responsible
that
you
are
going
into
this
rescue
eyes
open
and
are
getting
the
opinions
of
qualified
professionals
(
and
a
bunch
of
Yahoos
)
before
you
decide
to
take
this
horse
on
.
I
do
think
some
Y!A
users
need
to
work
on
their
reading
comprehension
as
I
ca
n't
comprehend
how
taking
a
horse
in
as
a
rescue
and
getting
it
qualified
medical
treatment
is
abuse
.
Worst
case
scenario
you
fall
in
love
and
after
spending
thousands
of
dollars
you
have
to
put
the
horse
down
.
Is
that
something
you
are
up
for
?
If
so
go
for
it
and
I
'll
give
you
all
the
moral
support
I
can
as
you
figure
out
what
is
up
.
It
is
heartbreaking
to
try
to
bring
a
horse
back
and
then
have
to
put
it
down
,
but
some
horses
are
worth
the
risk
.
If
you
feel
this
guy
is
worth
it
then
I
hope
your
vet
can
figure
things
out
.
As
to
EPM
like
Shee
said
being
in
MI
we
've
had
to
deal
with
it
.
Pretty
much
every
large
stable
has
here
.
Our
first
diagnosed
EPM
horse
was
back
when
there
was
no
treatment
in
the
US
and
only
an
experimental
chicken
feed
additive
in
Canada
.
We
hauled
the
horse
to
Windsor
and
got
him
treated
there
.
That
horse
returned
to
racing
and
we
did
n't
notice
much
difference
.
We
've
had
a
few
since
then
,
but
none
since
our
race
horses
began
wintering
in
Florida
.
I
have
no
idea
if
that
is
related
or
farmers
are
doing
a
better
job
of
clearing
out
opossums
now
because
they
know
opossums
are
carriers
,
but
we
have
n't
had
an
EPM
horse
in
at
least
10
years
.
I
can
say
all
of
our
EPM
horses
were
treated
early
when
they
were
showing
mild
signs
like
Shee
gave
and
all
returned
to
racing
.
One
horse
even
got
his
lifetime
mark
after
being
treated
for
EPM
.
We
've
always
liked
big
long
trotters
that
do
better
on
mile
tracks
then
1
/
2
mile
.
The
only
difference
we
noticed
is
that
the
EPM
horses
seemed
to
do
worse
on
the
smaller
tracks
after
.
It
might
just
be
coincidence
or
the
fact
those
great
big
trotters
with
those
extremely
long
backs
lost
a
bit
of
fine
coordination
to
get
those
gangly
bodies
around
those
tighter
turns
.
I
do
n't
know
.
MSU
does
a
lot
of
EPM
studies
because
of
how
common
it
is
here
.
You
may
want
to
see
if
you
can
get
in
touch
with
their
EPM
group
and
get
this
guy
in
a
study
.
I
know
they
did
lab
work
showing
that
Strongid
C
used
daily
could
help
prevent
EPM
.
I
believe
they
have
a
real
study
testing
the
lab
work
in
real
world
situations
now
,
but
it
may
be
some
time
before
those
results
are
released
.
Another
thought
with
this
being
a
mosquito
season
from
hell
could
it
be
West
Nile
?
West
Nile
can
cause
EPM
like
symptoms
and
does
n't
always
include
a
fever
.
Let
us
know
what
you
decide
to
do
.
You
hate
to
see
talent
get
wasted
,
but
honestly
I
do
n't
think
I
could
take
in
a
horse
right
now
these
issues
.
Personally
I
think
you
should
just
keep
on
walking
by
.
You
should
have
you
chiro
out
before
you
decide
if
you
want
this
horse
or
not
.
If
you
have
a
good
repoire
(
which
I
'm
sure
you
do
)
with
them
,
they
should
be
honest
on
if
this
horse
is
fixable
to
any
degree
...
not
really
sure
what
you
want
to
do
with
him
...
Even
if
you
can
figure
out
what
is
wrong
with
this
poor
poneh
,
there
is
always
the
chance
for
remission
and
then
relapse
so
you
may
have
to
do
deal
with
again
in
the
future
.
So
all
in
all
,
put
the
money
up
front
before
taking
on
this
horse
.
A
few
hundred
out
of
pocket
now
will
possibly
save
you
thousands
once
the
horse
is
in
your
name
.
Could
he
have
had
a
blow
to
the
head
causing
this
atrophy
?
Or
a
difficult
birth
?
Was
it
always
like
this
?
Or
has
it
occurred
since
birth
.
I
also
wonder
if
he
might
have
had
a
slight
stroke
?
I
think
if
you
can
not
afford
to
get
him
treated
that
you
should
not
consider
him
as
a
prospect
.
Who
knows
what
the
future
might
hold
,
and
it
might
be
expensive
?
Extremely
bad
customer
service
Do
not
go
to
this
salon
,
especially
if
you
have
to
get
your
hair
straightened
.
They
did
a
very
bad
job
with
my
hair
and
were
extremely
rude
when
I
went
back
to
ask
them
why
it
did
n't
work
for
my
hair
.
Rude
,
insensitive
,
discourteous
people
!!!!!
Great
Doc
Dr
Greenwalt
fixed
my
neck
from
a
snowboard
injury
and
was
way
more
effective
that
a
regular
doctor
.
He
did
nt
prescribe
pain
meds
or
other
drugs
,
he
used
his
bodytalk
method
which
is
unusual
but
the
results
are
undeniable
.
My
neck
is
fixed
!.
He
knows
what
he
s
doing
.
Our
Wedding
11/7/08
We
just
had
our

very
impressed

Cj

all
that
we
ask
and
10
times
more
.
The

If

with
they
are
the
ones

Excellent
Tattoo
Shop
I
recently
got
a
tattoo
done
at
Aztec
and
I
could
not
be
happier
.
It
came
out
better
than
I
even
imagined
.
The
shop
was
great
,
the
service
was
excellent
and
the
employees
were
fun
guys
.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
shop
to
anyone
looking
to
get
a
quality
tattoo
done
.
Good
and
Bad
I
had
to
take
care
of
the
ants
myself
.
But
I
found
the
location
wonderful
and
the
neighbors
very
kind
.
Never
had
a
problem
with
the
staff
and
found
them
very
helpful
when
something
went
wrong
.
Loved
the
pool
and
BBQ
.
Because
of
the
ants
I
dropped
them
to
a
3
star
.
Great
pet
care
I
have
used
Just
Like
Family
several
times
now
and
they
have
provided
great
care
for
my
two
dogs
.
Lynda
is
professional
and
has
great
compassion
for
animals
.
The
real
testament
is
not
in
how
much
she
likes
your
animals
but
how
much
they
like
her
.
I
highly
recommend
her
.

Best
Chineese
food
in
the
area
The
food
here
is
fresh
and
hot
out
of
the
Wok
.
The
food
is
cooked
fast
by
the
two
chefs
on
duty
.
The
lunch
specials
are
more
food
than
most
people
can
eat
for
about
$
6
.
It
is
busy
every
day
at
lunch
for
a
reason
,
the
service
is
fast
and
the
food
is
great
.
Pure
Pilates
!!
It
is
the
real
thing
-
I
have
been
practicing
Pilates
for
over
7
years
and
would
not
go
anywhere
else
.
It
is
the
attention
to
detail
and
the
quality
of
the
work
taught
at
TomiPilates
that
sets
this
studio
apart
from
the
others
.
The
teachers
are
highly
trained
and
are
expert
at
handling
all
types
of
clients
.
I
phoned
this
company
for
advice
on
our
office
refurb
and
although
we
did
not
use
them
in
the
end
(
as
our
building
contractor
carried
out
the
electrical
work
)
,
they
provided
me
with
plenty
of
useful
information
over
an
hour
phone
call
and
subsequently
we
are
now
using
PJC
as
our
electrical
maintenance
contractor
.
Thoroughly
recommended
They
really
go
above
and
beyond
!
For
example
,
I
actually
forgot
to
feed
my
cat
,
and
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
take
care
of
him
.
Additionally
,
when
there
was
confusion
(
my
fault
)
,
they
left
me
flowers
along
with
a
personalized
gift
.
They
have
been
100
%
reliable
and
professional
.
Definitely
recommend

you

Home
made
product
I
sometimes
go
into
this
store
just
for
something
to
do
on
a
sunday
afternoon
.
I
love
the
people
,
the
product
and
the
service
!
Nothing
compares
to
a
home
made
product
that
really
stands
the
test
of
time
.
-
The
Brick
,
Ikea
,
and
Leon
's
have
their
place
.
But
furniture
like
this
will
truly
be
around
forever
.
The
internet
here
is
terrible
.
Like
the
previous
poster
said
,
the
com
lines
are
split
between
the
entire
building
.
That
's
3
x
worse
than
Qwest
DSL
's
lowest

!
The
outward
appearance
makes
you
think
this
place
is
nice
,
but
everything
inside
is
cheap
cheap
cheap

You

even
if

quite
the

!
Extensive

list
and
daily

but
wish
they
had
a

more
on

,

popcorn
is
a
nice
touch
!
(
other
items
:
chicken

Their

is
very
poor

Attitude
of

very
bad

Never

Sometimes
even
gives

So
confused
at

stupid

Even
if

And
then

Hair
By
Nivine
in
eastgardens
fixed
my
hair
after
i
had
my
hair
cut
and
colored
at
another
salon
i
felt
more
confident
and
the
girls
are
fantastic
and
i
ve
been
going
there
now
for
2
years
always
happy
and
they
care
about
my
hair
had
my
hair
done
for
my
wedding
it
looked
fabolous
!
and
there
prices
are
really
good

Best
food
in
northeast
There
s
a
reason
why
Frank
mcclelland
was
named
best
chef
of
the
north
east
reigon
.
Food
here
is
absolutely
superb
.
Everything
is
delicous
and
cooked
perfectly
.
The
waiting
staff
is
beyond
impeccable
(
they
refold
your
napkin
when
you
go
to
the
bathroom
)
.
If
you
want
great
food
then
L'espalier
is
the
place
to
go
.
I
did
n't
end
up
buying
my
car
here
,
but
I
did
think
the
guy
who
worked
with
me
was
pretty
cool
-
he
was
willing
to
budge
a
little
on
the
price
which
means
a
lot
to
me
.
Also
they
will
fill
your
tires
with
air
and
other
small
maintenance
tasks
for
free
,
even
if
you
did
n't
buy
your
car
there

The

in

,
make
sure
you
stop
by

Their
selection
is
random
,
so
what
they
have
on

might
never

I
love
it

First
Time
Ballerina
My
daughter
is
starting
ballet
this
year
for
the
first
time
.
I
'm
a
soccer
mom
so
I
was
n't
sure
what
I
was
looking
for
when
it
comes
to
dancewear
.
The
staff
was
very
helpful
and
gave
me
exactly
what
I
needed
for
my
first
time
ballerina
.
The
service
at
Instep
was
great
!!
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
!
Outstanding
service
&
quality
at
a
very
affordable

This
place
is
top
notch
and
highly
affordable
!
I
would
recommend
it
hands
down
and
am
a
loyal
customer
.
I
've
also
sent
over
a
number
of
friends
to
use
the
services
here
and
everyone
is
extraordinarily
pleased
!
Thanks
for
doing
such
great
work
on
my
important
pieces

that
always
look

Absolutely
rude
service
every
time

The
staff
will
not
even
answer
the
phone
for

out
.
Tonight
,
I
called
several
times
with
no
answer
(
Btwn
5:30
and
6
pm
)
and
finally
drove
there
to
place
my
order
in
person
.
There
was
not
a
customer
to
be
found
.
we
purchased
a
new
home
but
was
unable
to
sell
our
old
house
so
we
contacted
this
property
management
company
and
they
have
helped
us
quickly
rent
out
our
house
and
keep
it
maintained
.
Since
then
we
have
decided
to
have
them
manage
our
other
investment
properties
as
well
as
we
getting
older
and
can
no
longer
perform
all
the
inquires
.
Great
help
!
We
just
got
our
sunroom
built
by
Patio
World
and
can
say
that
I
'm
extremely
happy
with
the
whole
thing
.
From
the
amount
of
time
spent
with
us
to
explain
things
during
the
initial
quote
,
to
the
communication
through
the
approval
process
to
the
actual
workmanship
of
the
build
itself
.
I
have
nothing
bad
to
say
.
Very
glad
that
we
went
with
them
.
No
Customer
Service
Employees
seemed
to
be
having
a
good
time
chatting
and
laughing
with
each
other
,
while
myself
and
other
customers
were
completely
ignored
.
Another
person
in
the
store
stood
there
with
an
item
and
repeatedly
tried
to
get
a
sales
person
s
attention
.
It
was
n't
until
he
gave
up
and
walked
out
the
door
that
someone
asked
Can
I
help
you
.
do
NOT
bring
your
car
here
I
got
a
coupon
from
Pennysaver
for
this
station
.
Yes
,
they
accepted
it
.
However
,
during
the
test
,
they
did
whatever
they
can
to
get
my
test
failed
.
Then
,
they
sold
me
overpriced
stuffs
,
such
as
oil
tank
cap
,
so
that
my
car
can
pass
it
right
away
.
I
ended
up
paying
much
more
.
Are
you
kidding
me
?
I
do
n't
get
it
.
Spongy
and
sweet
bread
(
microwaved
?
)
,
heartless
salsa
,
tiny
dogs
...
You
order
at
the
counter
and
there
is
a
space
for
tip
on
your
credit
card
receipt
.
The
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.
If
this
is
the
best
that
Tucson
has
to
offer
,
I
am
out
ta
here

I
called
on
a
Friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.
Dr.
Obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
I
should
call
him
on
Monday
.
I
had
been
a
patient
of
Dr.
Olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.
There
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
Fernandina
.
Do
n't
go
to
Amelia
Gentle
Dentistry
.
Good
location
For
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.
What
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
Read
:
No
downloading
)
.
Other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

First
time
eating
at
Caffe
Bella
Italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.
From
the
delectable
Antipasto
Misto
to
the
Spaghetti
alla
Barese
and
the
Parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.
Too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
Chocolate
Lava
Cake
.
Maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.
Service
was
excellent
!
Sandy
Beware
of
Sharayu
Hopless
service
,
at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.
Apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
I
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.
My
advise
to
all
is
I
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!
Course
has
come
a
long
way
!!
HCC
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
NEW
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!
The
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!
Come
back
and
give
HCC
a
second
chance
at
least
!
It
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!
Excellent
Physiotherapists
!
Kusal
Goonewardena
and
his
team
of
Physios
are
unbelievable
!
I
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.
It
took
the
Vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!
And
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
I
am
better
than
ever
.
Thanks
guys
!
They
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!
My
husband
and
I
happened
in
on
a
whim
.
We
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.
Our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.
My
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.
This
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.
Rude
Rude
Rude
went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!
she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!
i
wo
nt
go
back
!
she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!
brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!
It
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.
If
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!
Also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
I
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
BAC
>=
.15
)
.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
am
glad
I
went
in
!
The
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.
This
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.
The
followup
visit
is
FREE
!!
After
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
ER
prices
...
there
is
no
way
I
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!
I
will
be
back
and
telling
EVERYONE
about
this
clinic
.
THANK
YOU
!!
I
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
I
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.
Someone
else
I
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.
It
was
a
no
brainer
really
.
I
choose
Console
Pros
and
I
'm
happy
I
did
.
This
place
is
bad
.
It
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.
The
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)
This
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.
I
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

Ham
s
on
Friendly
...
RIP
This
is
the
original
Ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.
Victim
of
hard
times
and
I
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.
According
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.
I
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.
So
long
Ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.
We
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
First
Glass
Window
.
Our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.
We
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.
They
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.
We
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.
If
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.
Great
help
even
near
closing
time
!
I
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!
Oh
no
!!
I
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.
They
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.
I
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
I
have
been
using
this
past
year
!
Thanks
Run
on
!
Great
This
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.
I
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
I
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
I
want
a
haircut
.
When
I
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.
The
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.
Highly
Recommend
I
have
worked
with
Shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
No
matter
what
state
I
am
in
when
I
arrive
,
I
always
leave
feeling
better
.
She
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.
I
highly
recommend
her
.
Best
Store
In
Boothbay
Harbor
What
a
fantastic
store
,
I
love
this
place
.
Not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.
Their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.
They
also
have
the
best
tea
I
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
I
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.
The
BEST
Dr.
Aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.
Dr.
Aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.
She
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.
Even
though
I
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
I
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
BEST
!
My
wife
and
I
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.
I
finally
called
Matt
from
Bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.
He
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.
I
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!
Real
pros
I
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.
I
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?
Richard
Joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.
They
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.
Already
I
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
I
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
I
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
Atlanta
Paperback
Book
Printing
.
I
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!
They
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
The
food
was
just
not
good
!
I
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(
I
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...
I
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??
I
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
INSULTED
ME
WHEN
I
ASK
THEM
QUESTIONS
.
THEY
ARE
VERY
RUDE
AND
NASTY
.
PLEASE
DO
N'T
USE
THIS
MOVING
COMPANY
IF
YOU
DO
N'T
WANT
TO
:
CRY
,
HAVE
TROUBLE
AND
A
BAD
EXPERIENCE
ON
THE
DAY
OF
YOUR
MOVE
.
THEY
WILL
GIVE
YOU
A
LOW
PRICE
OVER
THE
PHONE
AND
ON
THE
DAY
OF
YOUR
MOVE
THEY
WILL
CHANGE
THE
PRICE
,
I
GUARANTEE
IT
.
You
've
Got
Maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.
I
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!
Satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!
Beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!
This
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.
Especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.
It
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.
I
spent
quite
a
bit
because
I
spoil
my
little
princess
.
After
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
I
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

Chicago
Great
place
for
Antique
Lighting
!
I
visited
their
huge
Chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
I
have
to
say
is
WOW
!!
Lots
of
collections
,
many
antique
light
fixtures
,
Chandeliers
,
custom
lighting
etc
.
I
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
Chandeliers
Chicago
.
Antiques
,
Vintage
,
Contemporary
&
Modern
Chandeliers
.
I
would
recommend
them
for
any

Great
Food
Awesome
food
Awesome
service
I
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.
This
place
rocked
.
Brought
my
wife
Deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
Fried
Crab
Wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..
We
also
had
the
BBQ
Spare
Ribs
..
good
also
.
I
ordered
the
MOO
SHU
pork
and
it
was
great
..
I
also
ordered
the
Neptune
Platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.
DO
NOT
GO
HERE
!!!
I
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
Friday
,
by
Monday
2
were
broken
.
I
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.
I
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.
No
way
.
I
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
Vietnamese
food
but
I
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
A
Dong
.
Cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.
Not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
Central
Iowa
.
How
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.
This
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.
Worth
Every
Penny
My
girlfriend
and
I
ate
at
The
Grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.
Everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.
The
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.
Then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.
I
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!
BEST
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
EVER
!!!
It
was
the
best
Chinese
food
I
have
ever
had
.
All
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.
The
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.
Every
time
I
go
,
Kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
I
.
Overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
I
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

We
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
I
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.
Got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with

which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp

which
was
also
good
.
Def
going
to
come
back

try
this
place
again

Bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.
Cute
place
also
As
a
native
southern
Californian
I
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
Mexican
food
.
However
,
I
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.
Esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.
Margaritas
are
alright
.
My
only
complaint
is
the
QUESO
.
It
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you

change
it

was
dealing
with
.
I
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
I
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.
While
I
hope
I
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
I
do
I
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.
Used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
To
Split
,
Croatia
)
was
as
requested
.
The
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.
Would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas
gift
delivery
.

I
LOVE
MY
GYM
!
FITNESS
UNLIMITED
is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.
If
you
are
serious
about
working
out
in
a
non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.
This
is
the
most
humble
gym
you
will
every
step
into
....
if
you
dare
to
work
on
your
body
do
n't
be
surprised
when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
FITNESS
UNLIMITED
can
be
!!
Over-rated
...
This
restaurant
is
over-rated
.
It
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.
The
service
is
poor
...
I
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!
Secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
Hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
American
cheese
!
The
Chili
Relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.
I
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
Fuji
Sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
I
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
L
17
.
Mixed
Tempura
.....................
8.25
Shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.
I
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.
I
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

Good
Pizza
at
a
good
price
I
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
I
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.
The
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
Friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.
Their
BBQ
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
I
have
ever
had
.
HORRIBLE
SERVICE
!!!
Absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.
They
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.
They
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!
How
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.
I
will
NEVER
do
business
with
Sun
Toyota
again
.
Thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
Toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.
this
is
a
good
place
I
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.
They
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.
I
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.
i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.
Anna
Marie
and
Govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.
A
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.
Give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...
They
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.
Went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
Honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.
The
salesperson
refused
!
Claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.
We
were
the
only
customers
there
!
Do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
Stevens
Creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!
ATE
HERE
A
COUPLE
TIMES
.
IT
IS
NOT
A
HIGH
END
STEAK
HOUSE
,
MORE
OF
THE
CUISINE
BRETT
ENJOYS
IN
MISSISSIPPI
.
SO
,
IF
YOU
WANT
A
BURGER
AND
FRIES
,
WELL
,
IT
IS
OK
.
IF
YOU
WANT
A
LITTLE
CAJUNISH
FOOD
-
IT
IS
GOOD
.
IF
YOU
WANT
A
STEAK
,
WELL
,
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
BEST
IN
GREEN
BAY
.
OVERALL
DECENT
BUT
IF
YOU
ARE
EXPECTING
A
RUTH
CHRIS
TYPE
STEAK
,
THIS
IS
NOT
IT
.
Eulogic
Good
place
to
be
on
a
Sunday
Night
.
The
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.
Filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.
But
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
Belgian
Tavern
.
If
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.
Perfect
Location
plus
I
moved
into
the
Tanglewood
Apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.
I
used
to
live
at
Meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.
The
manager
-
Tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
I
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.
She
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.
Plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.
great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business
I
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.
They
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.
One
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.
AND
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.
Overall
-
good
stuff
.
Another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!
The
best
cakes
EVER
!
A
bit
pricey
,
so
I
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
I
did
.
The
prices
were
worth
what
I
got
.
I
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
I
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.
I
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.
Super
nice
people
,
really
good
food
What
I
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
Baltimore
.
The
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.
One
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
Baltimore
.
Overpriced
This
place
is
identical
to
the
Youngstown
Sports
Grille
,
so
I
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.
The
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.
Do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.
I
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

Enjoyed

with

of

folks
.
Service
was
excellent
.
Food
was
excellent

Wine
was

I

I
had

was

the

looked
amazing

if

I
'll

order
a

A

Lots

Great

Very
helpful
!!!!
They
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
I
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
I
kept
for
several
years
.
Re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.
I
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
HR
Office
.
They
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.
I
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!
Great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!
I
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
Dumb
Friends
League
.
The
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.
If
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!
My
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!
Food
good
,
service
poor
No
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.
Asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.
Never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.
Had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.
Only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
I
guess
.
Food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.
Dr.
Chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
I
have
ever
had
.
You
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.
I
wish
I
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
However
I
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.
Even
though
you
are
expensive
.
Thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.
You
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.
Con
Garage
I
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.
I
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
I
replaced
a
hose
.
Ten
minutes
later
,
I
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.
If
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.
If
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.
Rude
service
even
though
I
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
I
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.
I
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.
He
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.
What
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?
I
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.
Top
notch

!
So
here
we
are
in
Manson

Manson
?
Yes
,
Manson
.
Right
near
Chelan

Aka
Nowheresville
.
And
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.
A
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.
Fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.
A
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.
Excellent
Service
and
Reasonable
Prices
Boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)
but
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
Purple
Goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
SAME
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.
The
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.
Will
definitely
return
.
Consistantly
poor
A
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
I
have
used
.
Chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
I
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
I
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
I
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
I
could
.
If
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
I
would
.
AMAZING
NIGHT
-
Great
Party
Spot
!!
Went
to
the
Willow
Lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.
Had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
A
/
C
broke
,
I
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!
Anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.
Drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.
This
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
SERIOUSLY
needs
.
Check
out
The
Willow
Lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!
It
s
been
a
few
years
since
I
have
been
to
Ipanema
.
But
my
wife
and
I
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
Brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!
And
,
I
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
Richmond
.
Amazing
!
Do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!
Excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff
I
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
Fraiser
's
.
We
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.
The
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.
I
highly
recommend
Fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.
FANTASTIC
STORE
!!!
I
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.
It
's
located
in
the
huge
HONKA
Log
Homes
building
,
by
Walmart
off
of
Evergreen
Parkway
.
The
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.
The
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.
This
store
is
what
Colorado
is
all
about
.
Also
,
I
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!
It's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
I
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!
Lovely
People
,
Great
Hats
I
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
World
Hats
Mart
has
poor
service
.
It
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
English
.
The
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.
We
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
I
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.
I
recommend
them
highly
!
DO
NT
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.
Their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.
I
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.
They
DO
NOT
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
SUCKS
,
they
will
NOT
take
it
back
!
DO
NOT
EVER
GO
HERE
.
I
prefer
Advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.
And
they
THRIVE
to
get
a
customer
.
DO
NOT
go
here
..
thank
you
Horrible
I
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.
I
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.
My
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.
This
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.
This
was
a
terrible
experience
and
I
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.
Do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.
The
worst
Burger
King
restaurant
!!!
I
generally
like
the
BK
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
I
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.
This
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
Branford
.
I
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.
I
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.
Disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.
Do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.
Disappointed
The
Bad
:
I
was
at
Napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.
We
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.
Napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.
I
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.
If
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.
Highly
Recommended
We
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.
The
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.
Their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
I
walk
in
.
We
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.
HORRIBLE
!!!!
!
This
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
I
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.
The
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.
It
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.
There
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.
I
know
New
York
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!
This
was
nothing
like
New
York
style
pizza
!!!.
I
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!
I
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!
best
quote
ever
My
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
I
called
A
CLASS
Garage
Doors
Dr
Services
.
They
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.
They
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.
Once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.
I
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
I
will
be
calling
A

Doors
You

Allen
Tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
Temecula
.
The
store
manager
,
Jim
Smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
Lexus
.
Tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.
The
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.
They
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.
Easiest
Time
I
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!
Excellent
service
,
Not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
I
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.
Very
kind
and
reliable
.
I
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.
I
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
The
first
one
was
from
Phillip
and
the
second
was
from
Richard
.
Both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.
This
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.
I
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.
Today
I
went
into
Kwik
Kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
I
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.
Extremely
helpful
and
professional
As
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
I
found
Stephanie
Fairchild
at
Prudential
Steamboat
Realty
,
extremely
helpful
.
She
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.
Stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.
We
would
highly
recommend
Stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
Yampa
Valley
.
We
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!
Great
Barber
Firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
Nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
Nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.
I
have
been
going
to
Nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.
I
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.
Some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
Nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.
UGH
!!!
Got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.
Took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.
Flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!
Ugh
!!
I
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.
She
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.
I
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.
Same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.
I
'll
never
go
back
there
again
For
cheap
Chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.
I
used
to
eat
at
places
like
New
China
or
Green
Buffet
in
Troy
,
MO
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.
Now
,
I
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
Chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.
The
best
value
I
've
found
from
a
Chinese
restaurant
.
I
do
n't
live
in
Lake
St.
Louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.
Now
I
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'

Amazing
Experience
!
My
experience
was
amazing
at
Providence
Aesthetics
and
Medical
Spa
.
Jana
Kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.
She
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.
Jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.
Provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.
Walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.
Equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.
I
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
Jana
Kueck
and
Robin
Talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.
Dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.
Also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.
Dave
has
much
to
offer
.
In
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
I
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
YouTube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence

We
love
our
new
roof
!
We
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.
Everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.
We
also
liked
the
way
that
Ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.
And
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.
We
would
not
hesitate
to
use
Spears
Roofing
again
.
We
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!
OMFG

HATE
THIS
PLACE
EVERY
TIME
i
GO
THIS
HOT
CHICK
SHOWS

AND
i

HOT
BUT
SHE

LIKE
REAAAALLY
DUMB
AND
THEN
THEIR
IS
THIS
OTHER
CHICK
THAT
IS
REALY
UGLY
BUT
SHE
IS
LIKE
SUPER
SMART
SHE
COULD
BE
A
SCIENTIST
,
BUT
THEN
THEIR
IS
THIS
STONER
WHO
ALWAYS
COMES
HERE
HIGH
AND
HE
ALWAYS
BRINGS
HIS
FUCKING
DOG
WHO
IS
SO
HIGH
FROM
THE
SECOND
HAND
SMOKE
I
THINK
HE
IS
TRYING
TO
TALK
.
ANYWAY
WE
DRIVE
AROUND
IN
MY
VAN
AND
SOLVE
MYSTERYS
AND
SHIT
AMAZINGLY
YUMMY
!
I
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!
My
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
I
was
so
excited
I
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!
Their
customer
service
was
perfect
!
Their
Food
was
better
then
anything
I
had
ever
tasted
.
EVEN
IN
FRANCE
!
I
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!
Thank
you
Roll
UP
Crepes
!
This
is
one
of
the
worst
places
I
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
Mulberry
.
Even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.
The
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.
Bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.
The
best
person
is
the
valet
.
Short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
Marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.
BEST
PLACE
IN
AMES
I
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
The
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!
I
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
Wessex
,
also
the
manager
Sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.
The
fitness
center
was
GREAT
!
The
only
problem
that
I
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
I
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.
I
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!
I
absolutely
LOVED
living
there
.
The
Best
Service
Ever
!!
I
have
never
had
better
service
.
My
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
Sussman
Kia
.
They
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.
Everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.
The
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.
The
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.
I
give
this
dealer
an
A
+
!
I
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.
HEAVEN

fine
food
The
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.
There
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.
The
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.
The
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.
It
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
European
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
OK
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.
Love
the
soups
.
The
New
Italian
Kid
on
the
Block
Another
Italian
restaurant
in
Collingswood
?
Do
we
need
another
one
?
Only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
That
's
Amore
.
The
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.
The
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.
Chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.
Pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
I
go
there
I
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.
Auto
Towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
I
have
used
.
The
first
time
I
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
I
needed
.
The
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
Auto
Towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
I
had
.
They
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
I
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.
If
you
are
looking
for
towing
services

A
very
satisfied
new
customer
!
As
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
I
wholeheartedly
recommend
United
Air
Duct
Cleaning
.
They
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.
Not
only
were
my
wife
and
I
very
pleased
,
but
I
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
I
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
United
Air
Duct
performed
their
work
.
Based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
“
excellent
”
.
The
Best
Breakfast
in
Solana
Beach
!
We
love
T
's
Cafe
!
Without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.
T
's
has
been
a
North
County
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.
Family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.
I
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.
If
you
've
been
to
North
County
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.
Prominent
Builders
NJ
Prominent
Builders
in
New
Jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
I
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
I
am
so
glad
I
used
them
for
my
Home
renovation
,
and
addition
.
They
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
Job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.
Mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
I
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
I
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.
Great
Dude
Cut
!
Great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.
I
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
#
1
.
After
going
through
5
other
places
I
finally
found
Janice
at
Alta
Moda
.
Not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
I
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
I
've
ever
had
.
Either
I
suck
at
my
own
style
or
Janice
is
a
genius
.
Looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.
Worth
every
penny
.
My
Favorite
place
at
Wildwood
I
have
been
going
to
the
Wildwood
,
NJ
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
Madrid
first
.
I
rated
it
5
stars
.
I
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.
I
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
Wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.
It
is
the
hospitality
from
Tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.
We
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.
When
in
Scordia
,
Sicily
If
ever
in
Sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
Anna
Maria
Jose
Mudo
and
her
familia
.
They
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
Sicily
that
you
will
meet
.
You
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
Italiano
language
.
You
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
Sicilian
culture
,
that
I
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.
I
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
Sicilian
family
showed
me
when
I
was
there
for
3
years
.
Luv
always
..
I
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
I
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
I
believe
to
be
Mrs
Closs
)
I
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.
If
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!
Nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!
Best
Car
Dealer
in
TX
I
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.
The
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.
They
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.
The
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.
They
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.
Overall
,
I
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.
If
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.
They
have
a
huge
inventory
.
I
have
been
a
patient
a
NW
hospital
and
it
was
great
.
I
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
I
take
of
sent
to
the
ER
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.
Yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
ER
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.
Any
ER
would
be
the
same
.
As
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.
As
a
nurse
I
know
about
drug
seekers
.
This
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
UW
system
.
Wonderful
Experience
I
had
immense
pain
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
I
would
never
find
a
Dentist
on
a
Sunday
.
Dr.
Taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
Sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.
He
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
I
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.
Coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
Dr.
Taylor
was
the
best
!
He
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!
I
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!
HORRIBLE
This
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.
I
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.
There
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.
The
staff
and
the
Principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
They
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
TRIPPED
OVER
a
student
's
)
.
The
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
NOT
send
your
student
here
.
Excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.
They
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.
That
was
4
years
ago
.
I
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
Seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.
(
I
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)
If
I
had
time
to
drive
to
Tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
I
would
just
so
I
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.
So
Handy
for
Local
La
Jolla
Stuff
-
Especially
for
Finding
Residential
Numbers
Since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
Village
,
I
have
referred
to
the
La
Jolla
Blue
Book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.
The
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
I
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.
It
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
I
want
to
spread
the
word
.
THX
:-)
The
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.
The
last
time
I
did
that
I
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
I
told
them
I
was
looking
for
a
fps
.
I
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.
He
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
I
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.
Overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.
First
and
Last
time
we
'll
eat
there
My
friend
and
I
went
there
for
lunch
today
.
Neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.
BIG
MISTAKE
-
The
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.
We
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.
The
only
thing
I
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
I
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
OK
-
His
Mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.
Would
NOT
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.
Liquidweb.com
Rocks
!!!
I
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
Steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.
I
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
Liquidweb
.
As
I
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
I
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
Liquidweb
also
Steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.
The
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!
I
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
Liquidweb.com

Hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
I
've
ever
eaten
(
and
I
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.
The
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.
I
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
I
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.
Great
Prices
,
Great
service
!
I
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
Discount
!
They
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.
The
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!
There
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.
The
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
I
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.
Top
notch
,
all
the
way
!
David
is
amazing
David
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
I
have
used
.
He
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.
He
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.
Both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.
He
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.
I
would
highly
recommend
David
to
anyone
.
He
will
exceed
your
expectations
!
He
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.
Not
so
great
My
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.
It
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.
But
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.
He
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??
So
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.
Which
was
very
expensive
.
He
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??
Trek
is
not
so
great
Only
Concerned
With
Money
I
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
I
was
told
I
should
expect
.
The
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
I
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.
Never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.
It
's
pretty
ridiculous
!
They
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!
They
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!
Terrible
service
!!!
Made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.
They
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.
When
I
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
KNEW
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!
Instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.
So
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!
To
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?
I
will
NEVER
do
business
with
this
company
!
EVER
!!!
Internet
Department
is
rude
and
insulting
I
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
Internet
salesperson
Last
name
is
Balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
AND
IF
IT
WAS
WORTH
MY
TIME
I
WOULD
OF
BOTHERED
ASWERING
YOUR
QUESTIONS
.
I
MAKE
MONEY
NOT
DEAL
WITH
BROKERS
"
Wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.
As
a
previous
Internet
Manager
I
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.
Stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!
This
place
is
a
Rip
-
Off
I
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
March
of
2010
.
They
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.
I
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.
Those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.
I
did
the
work
myself
for

There
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.
My
girlfriend
and
I
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
Outback
.
What
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
GEM
.
#
1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.
#
2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
#
3
the
food
is
FANTASTIC
.
This
is
authentic
Cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.
The
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.
TRY
THIS
PLACE
-
YOU
'LL
LOVE
IT
.
Thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!
I
came
in
and
saw
Dr.
Ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.
I
have
to
tell
you
that
I
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.
It
is
the
easiest
thing
that
I
have
ever
done
and
I
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.
I
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.
Dr.
Ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.
I
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
I
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
I
did
before
.
I
ca
n't
thank
you
enough

Fantastic
for
kids
If
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.
It
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.
They
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
I
recommend
you
buy
lots
.
We
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
I
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.
The
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.
Among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
EVEN
AN
OSTRICH
!!!
Wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!
WOW
!!!
I
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
Karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
Gracee
.
Gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!
She
has
always
been
there
for
Gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!
She
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
I
would
not
let
Gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!
She
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!
You
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
GREAT
hands
with
Wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!
Worst
Service
I
've
Ever
Experienced
I
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.
1
)
Service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.
2
)
The
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.
(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
I
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.
4
)
The
business
is
very
unorganized
.
The
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.
I
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.
Exile
is
the
best
!!!
Exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
Richmond
!
I
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.
The
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
Mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.
The
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
Europe
.
In
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
Asia
.
Exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.
Shop

Exile

Over-rated
Buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
Steven
Starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.
The
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.
The
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.
The
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!
$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!
I
would
n't
go
there
again
.
Alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.
From
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.
The
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.
I
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.
Also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
Alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.
While
it
's
not
cheap
,
Alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.
The
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful
I
have
lived
in
Buckingham
Condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.
I
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!
I
'm
a
single
female
and
I
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.
The
maintenance
people
are
AWESOME
!!!!
And
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.
Yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!
The
only
problem
that
I
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.
She
is
a
pure
b****
!!!
I
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.
Other
than
that
,
I
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)
The
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.
The
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.
A
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.
She
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.
I
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.
If
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.
Sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.
He
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

Wonderful

I
would
give
the
Wildernest
inn
ten
stars

!
Atop
Spring
Mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
West
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.
I
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.
There
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.
and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.
It
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!
Kathy
and
Stewart
,
the
proprietors
were

Delightful
,

,

I
hope

really
weird
place
,
I
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
I
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.
The
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.
I
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was

WOW

A
friend
and
I
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.
While
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.
It
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
I
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.
For
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.
Restored
my
faith
in
Mechaincs
.
I
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
Ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.
I
was
about
to
give
up
when
I
met
Jason
and
Neal
.
They
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
Ferrari
all
I
dreamed
of
and
more
.
The
crew
at
The
Creative
Workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
I
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.
I
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.
They
have
restored
my
faith
in
Mechanics
.
Do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..
a
great
vacation
!
We
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!
Excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.
After
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
Wenatchee
hills
(
in
May
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
Columbia
River
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....
This
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
I
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.
OMG
OMG
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
I
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.
The
waiters
are
like
no
other
...
My
waiter
was
so
excellent
I
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..
The
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..
I
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
Color

If
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
Giovanni
Ristorante
should
be
your
number

+

choice

Holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!
I
have
lived
in
the
UTC
La
Jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
I
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
Holly
here
.
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.
All
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.
I
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.
She
did
a
great
job
!
Holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
I
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.
My
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
I
get
compliments
all
the
time
.
I
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
Holly
to
anyone
.
You
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!
Outdated
but
not
bad
So
I
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.
It
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.
The
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.
If
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
I
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.
Great
,
and
probably
the
only
West
Indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
Nashville
.
I
was
born
and
raised
in
Toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
West
Indian
(
Trinidadian
,
Jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.
So
huge
in
fact
,
that
Toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
Jamaican
references
,
and
Jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.
Anyway
,
I
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
West
Indian
cuisine
,
Jamaica
Way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
American
palette
.
All
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
Jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.
A
lot
.
The
finest
Christmas
Trees
i
've
ever
seen
.
I
felt
like
I
was
in
heaven
when
I
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.
The
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.
The
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.
I
especially
liked
the
Eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.
This
is
one
of
the
best
farms
I
have
ever
been
too
.
I
would
call
it
the
Taj
Mahal
of
the
east
coast
!
It
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
I
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
Jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.
Thanks

Pho
-
nomenal
!!
I
have
been
eating
Pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
I
've
always
gone
to
the
Pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!
all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.
The
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.
the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.
remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.
hope
this
helps
!!
Had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
Rachel
McInnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...
I
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.
I
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
I
considered
Dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.
It
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.
Highly
Recommend
I
work
as
a
Transformational
Life
Coach
.
Since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
I
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
I
feel
that
is
appropriate
.
I
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
I
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.
Little
did
I
know
that
I
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!
She
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.
I
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.
I
would
recommend
her
highly
!
They
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.
First
,
let
me
state
that
although
I
live
in
NYC
,
I
am
not
from
NYC
,
I
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
I
absolutely
love
Boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.
That
said
,
I
hated
this
restaurant
.
The
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
I
'd
get
in
NYC
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.
The
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.
Personally
I
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere
When
I
arrived
at
Brickell
Honda
on
6/4/11
,
I
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
Sales
Manager
,
Gustavo
Guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.
I
explained
to
him
what
I
wanted
and
that
I
previously
went
to
Braman
Honda
.
Bramen
Honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.
He
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"
Mr.
Guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.
Brickell
Honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.
I
urge
all
St.
Thomas
the
Apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
South
Florida
residents
to
come
see
Gus
!!!
Excellent
customer
service
!!!
Great
,
Honest
Service
I
took
my
2001
Nissan
Frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.
The
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.
Eagle
Transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!
I
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
Mike
and
everyone
at
Eagle
Transmission
!
I
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.
I
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
I
trust
!!
And
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!
Dr.
Shady
Kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
Dr.
Shady
is
a
jerk
.
After
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
I
will
not
be
returning
!!
Good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
Dr.
Shady
.
You
have
just
lost
mine
.
The
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!
Dr.
Shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.
She
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
EXPERIENCED
vets
do
in
this
area
.
I
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
I
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.
Beautifully
written
reviews
Doctor
,
but
completely
UNTRUE
.
Poor
Experience
I
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
Dr.
Ghassemlou
.
During
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
I
've
always
kept
private
as
I
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.
I
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.
I
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.
I
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.
Saying
that
I
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
I
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.
It
's
pretty
combative
actually
.
you
'll
love
it
I
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.
I
wish
that
I
had
n't
done
this
.
With
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.
Even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.
I
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
Dr.
de
Barros
.
He
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.
You
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.
Unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!
I
have
been
to
Kim
at
Cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.
I
can
not
tell
you
how
often
I
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
AND
color
)
!
I
regularly
request
Kim
's
business
cards
as
I
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
Who
does
your
hair
...
I
LOVE
it
!!!
"
Quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
BIG
personality
.
I
am
made
to
feel
special
when
I
am
in
the
chair
and
I
have
NEVER
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.
My
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.
I
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!
Thanks
Cheveux
!
My
Favorite
in
McLean
My
family
loves
coming
to
Endo
Sushi
.
They
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!
Sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
NEVER
overcrowded
.
If
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
Endo
Sushi
.
The
service
is
fast
.
Be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!
(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)
Horrible
Service
!
I
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.
I
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.
Rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.
Seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
NO
care
for
the
customers
AT
ALL
!!!
Missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.
I
will
NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR
go
to
this
place
again
.
Superb
Arrangements
I
used
Fancy
Flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.
I
am
so
glad
that
I
called
in
to
see
Ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.
The
flowers
were
all
that
I
hoped
they
would
be
,
I
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
I
recieved
from
Ana
outshone
them
all
.
She
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.
Thank
you
Ana
I
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.
Great
first
experience
.
I
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
I
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
I
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
I
wanted
it
to
.
She
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.
She
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.
It
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.
I
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.
Oh
!
And
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.
Smoker
s
Haven
Yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.
Our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.
Both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.
And
non-smokers
beware
!!!
I
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!
If
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.
Our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.
You
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.
Great
Sanwiches
,
Great
Prices
I
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
I
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.
Chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.
Best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.
For
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.
The
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.
Tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
I
certainly
do
.
This
is
n't
a
TGIF
or
Cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.
Rate
a
church
?
Might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.
It
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!
Big
,
grey
and
imposing
.
Go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.
The
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
I
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.
He
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.
God
was
pleased
with
that
one
!
It
's
historical
for
Sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.
Great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.
Stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!
ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.
me
and
my
dad
where
in
NJ
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
NY
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.
i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.
the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.
i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
New
York
.
but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review
It
was
a
Saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...
I
googled
Garage
Door
Repair
in
Woodinville
and
found
NDI
-
Johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!
She
sort
of
appologized
for
Dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
Sunday
!
I
said
great
and
Dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.
I
enjoyed
speaking
with
Dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.
The
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.
I
would
highly
recommend
NDI
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.
Thanks
Dan
and
Johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.
Roger
M.
,
Woodinville
I
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.
I
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
April
2010
.
She
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.
Wow
,
really
?
With
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?
REAL
CHRISTIAN
OF
YOU
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
THE
LAST
THING
I
WOULD
DO
IS
LET
A
CHILD
GET
RAPED
BECAUSE
I
WAS
N'T
PAID
.
Excellent
service
I
could
easily
go
to
Nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
I
go
to
the
Garment
District
for
their
service
.
Previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
I
can
understand
that
,
but
I
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.
Tiffany
is
fabulous
!
I
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
I
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.
She
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.
I
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!
Huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.
We
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.
The
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.
The
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.
The
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.
To
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.
We
should
have
left
then
.
We
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.
Everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.
We
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.
Hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.
I
recommend
La
Hacienda
Might
try
again
Pros
:
*
Jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
Pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
Great
Dessert
*
Not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
I
like
!
Do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
Purple
Hull
Peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.
Cons
:
*
Server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
Pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
Overcooked
food
*
Time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.
Half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.
Other
Thoughts
:
Will
try
this
place
again
.
There
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.
Their
Club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.
very
professional
/
very
helpful
the
people
at
Fidelity
Leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.
i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.
they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.
my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.
after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.
from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.
i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.
This
insurance
co.
Is
a
joke
!!!
They
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.
if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.
They
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.
They
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.
as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?
I
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

Fantastic
Service
!
I
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.
I
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.
It
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!
What
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
I
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.
Great
service
,
great
pricing
and
SUPER
CONVENIENT
!
I
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
I
did
not
need
.
Love
my
home
at
Creekside
I
moved
to
Creekside
Apartments
in
August
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!
The
management
from
Julie
and
Janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
Edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.
They
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
I
have
asked
for
help
.
Although
the
apartments
are
facing
Stokes
Street
and
close
to
the
Bascom
Light
Rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.
I
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.
The
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
Trader
Joe
's
,
Whole
Foods
,
and
other
stores
.
The
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!
Great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
San
Jose
!
I
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.
Liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
I
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
We
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.
Not
once
did
I
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
I
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.
Very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.
I
'm
glad
I
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.
Find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.
Do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!
I
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
I
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.
Even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.
If
you
have
been
to
the
London
Aquarium
I
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.
If
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
£
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.
(
For
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!

Cranmore
Dental
and
Implant
Clinic
:
I
could
not
recommend
Dr
David
Nelson
enough
.
I
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
I
met
and
was
treated
by
Dr
Nelson
.
He
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.
My
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
I
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!
In
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
Dr
Nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
–
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.
He
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

Pam
Gillies
Best
Salsa
(
hehehe
)
After
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.
The
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
I
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.
No
joke
!
I
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
James
,
I
NEED
another
jar
badly
:)
All
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
I
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.
Very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
I
got
home
from
work
.
And
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them

Dr.
Mann
killed
our
pet
Yea
,
Dr.
Mann
ai
n't
so
great
.
We
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.
We
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
Dr.
Mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.
If
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
I
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.
Oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
AND
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
DISPOSAL
'
fee
.
They
actually
itemized
it
as
a
DISPOSAL
fee
.
AVOID
AT
ALL
COSTS
.
One
of
the
worst
places
This
place
and
its
sister
store
Peking
Garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.
the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.
i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.
i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.
in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.
Gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership
Sigh
.
I
used
to
LOVE
this
place
.
But
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.
I
am
waiting
longer
at
BNA
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
I
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.
Lucky
I
had
a
spare
with
me
!
To
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.
(
These
new
car
keys
are
EXPENSIVE
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
WalMart
.
)
Go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.
However
,
with
BNA
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
BNA
.
Wife
and
I
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.
We
arrived
Sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.
We
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.
I
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.
They
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
I
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.
I
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.
They
refused
.
Terrible
communication
as
well
.
At
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.
Huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.
College
is
a
Joke
and
the
Salon
is
a
JOKE
!
Went
to
the
school
here
OVER
PRICED
!!!!!!
You
do
NOT
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.
You
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!
Going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.
Staff
is
under
educated
.
Going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.
Over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!
Beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
AT
ALL
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!
BEWARE
!
You
can
fool
people
This
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.
They
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.
They
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.
With
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!
So
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Richmond
Ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.
Never
again
Do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.
You
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.
This
is
the
only
place
I
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.
I
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
I
wanted
to
finish
it
.
Oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
Bloody
Mary
or
Mimosas
.
Plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.
Go
next
door
to
the
Ball
Square
Cafe
instead
.
I
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
I
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.
We
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.
Since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.
Then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.
We
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.
When
I
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
English
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"
I
was
thoroughly
impressed
!
I
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.
I
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
I
found
but
very
reasonable
.
The
best
part
is
I
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
company's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.
They
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.
We
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?
Very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.
Best
money
I
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.
I
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

JAZZ
.
We
have
attended
A
Ward
Dance
Centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
Ballroom
and
Latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
Saturday
evening
....
It
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
We
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
Stars
across
the
board
Steve
&
Anne
I
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
BMW
from
this
dealership
.
The
night
I
drove
back
home
,
I
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.
(
You
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.
Very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.
I
admit
that
I
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.
(
But
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)
So
I
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.
They
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!
Who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.
I
walked
away
.
So
my
advice
is
that
NEVER
TRUST
THIS
DEALER
.
STAY
AWAY
AS
FAR
AS
POSSIBLE
.
Perfect
Practice
After
I
had
chosen
The
Fountain
Dental
Practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.
Everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.
Surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
I
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.
The
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
I
always
felt
that
I
was
in
capable
hands
.
My
dental
surgeon
,
Dr.
Lucy
Nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.
Everyone
was
so
helpful
that
I
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....
Peter
Wonderful
service
for
large
group
I
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
BJ
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
I
made
.
It
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
I
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.
We
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.
We
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.
Even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!
I
really
appreciate
BJ
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.
wonderful
I
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.
I
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
I
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.
I
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.
Sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.
I
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.
It
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.
Usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.
But
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.
It
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!
I
am
definitely
going
back
After
recently
relocating
to
South
Bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
New
Year
s
Eve
dinner
.
We
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
Jazz
Club
.
The
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
NYE
menu
.
The
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
NYE
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.
After
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.
This
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
Trio
's
.
Run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!
One
night
was
too
much
.
First
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
I
requested
it
be
rectified
.
I
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.
I
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
This
is
a
Days
Inn
,
not
the
Hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.
To
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.
There
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
I
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.
Grocery
and
Daily
Needs
Store
Before
using
FusionRetail
Before
installing
FusionRetail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.
We
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.
Being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.
Managing
POS
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.
How
FusionRetail
has
overcome
these
issues
?
FusionRetail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.
Usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.
How
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?
Billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
How
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered
?
Over
telephone
,
immediate
.
On
call
,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!
This
is
by
far
the
BEST
B&B
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!
We
were
in
Santa
Fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
El
Paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.
We
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.
The
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
Sue
and
her
great
staff
.
Everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.
We
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
Santa
Fe
and
to
this
great
B&B
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
Ms.
Sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!
We
would
highly
recommend
the
El
Paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
Santa
Fe
!
Disatisfied
customer
,
I
went
through
Kitchen
Aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.
A&E
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.
I
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
I
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.
The
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
A&E
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
A&E
does
not
)
.
Their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
A&E
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.
Seems
to
me
like
A&E
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!
Very
disappointed
in
Kitchen
Aid
as
well
,
I
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!
Lovely
Nails
on
Cayuga
St.
in
Lewiston
,
NY
First
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
I
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
Lovely
Nails
on
Military
Road
.
I
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
Lewiston
,
as
I
live
in
Youngstown
.
I
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
I
have
had
in
my
life
.
There
were
four
of
us
and
I
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.
I
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.
He
did
warm
it
up
.
He
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.
If
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.
The
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.
None
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.
Good
Service
-
Limited
Results
Andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.
He
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.
The
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
I
liked
.
The
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.
I
worked
with
Andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.
The
sessions
were
nice
and
I
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.
I
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
I
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.
(
I
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)
Friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location
The
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.
Common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
–
A
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
Parisian
croissants
.
Comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!
The
location
is
really
stellar
!
It
is
next
to
Gare
du
Nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
Sacre
Coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.
It
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
Opera
Plaza
,
Galleries
Lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
Market
.
We
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
Vintage
Hostel
again
.
Just
Autos
Thank
you
!
Was
fast
and
easy
,
Just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
I
would
recommend
these
Mobile
Mechanics
for
sure
.
They
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.
The
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.
They
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
I
gave
the
go
ahead
.
Now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.
So
yes
,
I
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
Just
Autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
Thank
you
Just
Autos
for
your
help
.
I
stopped
in
today
@
Yards
Brewery
.
I
must
say
,
I
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
I
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!
I
had
a
sampler
of
IPA
,
Brawler
,
Love
Stout
&
ESA
.
All
were
awesome
,
&
I
had
a
Dogwood
Grilled
Cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.
After
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
I
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
Nitrogen
Love
Stout
,
I
must
say
I
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
I
am
a
Guiness
Lover
so
coming
from
me
,
I
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!
If
you
are
in
Philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!
The
only
negative
I
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!
I
left
with
a
case
of
BRAWLER
!!!!

Oil
Change
Disaster
My
wife
had
taken
her
'07
Ford
Fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.
A
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.
Turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.
There
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.
All
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.
Once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.
I
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.
Plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.
Liars
,
negative
stars
!
Took
my
Cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.
The
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.
However
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.
I
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!
They
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.
I
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.
They
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.
I
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.
They
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.
They
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
I
drove
the
car
home
I
had
the
same
symptoms
.
I
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
Vic
Canever
.
Great
Job
I
want
to
say
that
Mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.
Both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
Mike
was
very
understanding
.
It
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
Mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.
He
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.
I
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.
My
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.
Both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.
Thank
you
Mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

We
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.
There
were
3
names
before
us
.
The
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.
However
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.
This
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
“
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
”
.
I
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
English
.
I
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.
I
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.
My
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.
Instructor
never
showed
up
!
January
15th
--
We
were
signed
up
for
Saturday
's
2
PM
class
"
Beginning
Yoga
with
Brittany
.
"
We
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.
The
instructor
did
not
show
up
!
We
waited
until
2:25
PM
and
then
left
.
There
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.
Well
,
not
much
I
can
say
except
I
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.
This
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.
In
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.
As
a
yoga
studio
,
I
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
…
and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
Google
.
Finest
??
Really
??
I
beg
to
differ
.
This
place
is
marginal
at
best
.
Not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.
I
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.
I
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.
I
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
I
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.
Rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.
Again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.
Best
DJ's
In
Town
!
Wow
!
These
guys
were
the
best
.
They
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.
We
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.
They
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.
Having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!
They
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.
I
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.
So
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.
They
just
really
know
their
stuff
!
NEVER
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!
I
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.
By
the
age
of
24
I
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.
My
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!
It
took
all
the
courage
I
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.
At
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
I
nearly
turned
around
.
I
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.
Doctor
Gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
I
have
ever
dealt
with
.
They
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.
I
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.
The
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.
Thank
you
Doctor
Gonzales
,
Doctor
Stout
,
Eva
Marie
and
the
entire
staff

HORRIBLE
SERVICE
AND
FOOD
not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!
In
the
past
,
I
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.
Today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.
It
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!
Does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?
I
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
I
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.
I
would
NOT
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.
Texas
Roadhouse
is
WAY
better
!!
Spay
and
neuter
service
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.
But
I
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.
My
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
So
I
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.
You
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.
Which
is
so
dumb
.
Not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.
Billing
Issues
...
I
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.
My
insurance
company
,
Blue
Cross
/
Blue
Shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.
Then
I
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.
The
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.
Blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.
The
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
BC
/
BS
.
They
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.
I
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.
It
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.
How
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?
Not
only
am
I
being
bilked
for
money
I
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.
I
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!
We
have
been
blessed
to
find
Elite
Flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.
We
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.
They
have
the
best
rates
and
GREAT
customer
service
.
On
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.
They
did
that
with
no
problem
.
I
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.
I
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.
They
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.
They
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.
I
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.
Because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.
I
recommend
this
company
to
ANYONE
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!
They
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!
sheisters
i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.
I
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.
Their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
There
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.
Well
I
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?
Anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.
The
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.
I
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.
From
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?
If
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?
Grimy
work
you
guys
do

Best

Papeluna
,
a
cute
Mom

Pop
custom
printing

paper
store
,
just
opened
a
few
days

.
It
is
right
on

some
might
miss
it
as
it
is
nestled
in

I
popped
in
after
my
afternoon
pumpkin

It
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of

I
gave

to
let

This
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.
They
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event

team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that

good
premise

On
a
recent
event
quote
that
I
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.
The
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
I
'm
in

they
just
have

teams
'
in

I
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to

about

in

quote

Canadian

Orr
's
a
nightmare
!
DO
N'T
GO
!
My
boyfriend
and
I
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.
When
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!
Then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.
Not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.
Orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.
To
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.
Do
n't
go

FHS
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998
I
enjoyed
my
time
at
Franklin
High
School
.
We
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
I
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.
Now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.
All
to
the
good
.
For
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
US
News
.
If
I
remember
,
students
went
to
Dartmouth
,
U.
Penn
,
Duke
,
BU
,
William
and
Mary
,
Vassar
,
Howard
,
and
Carnegie
Mellon
,
among
others
.
Many
students
went
to
Rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.
The
point
is
--
FHS
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.
Absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!
I
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
I
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
I
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
I
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
I
've
stayed
at
!
A
large
group
of
my
friends
and
I
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.
The
rooms
are
SO
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.
There
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.
The
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)
I
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!
My
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
Orlando
I
have
been
eating
Cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..
I
love
Cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
I
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
I
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
I
'm
in
the
area
for
a
Cuban
coffee
or
snack
.
The
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.
They
do
n't
speak
the
best
English
but
enough
to
get
by
.
They
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
I
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.
They
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.
And
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!
I
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.
Stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.
A
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!
highly
recommended
.
I
have
been
going
to
Warner
Family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.
I
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...
I
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.
I
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.
I
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
FAMILY
practice
...
Warner
Family
is
the
place
for
you
.
Not
what
i
expected
!
We
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!
~
It
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.
Very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
There
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.
Scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.
On
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....
Would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
A
LOT
better
and
cheaper
.
Nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!
Hot
Iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.
Everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.
The
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.
They
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.
They
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.
The
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!
Every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.
Meats
are
kept
VERY
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
VERY
clean
.
Prices
are
reasonable
,
(
Kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
Wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
I
believe
.
Great
Cookies
,
Cakes
,
and
Customer
Service
It
was
my
birthday
and
I
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
Valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
Fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.
Not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.
Although
I
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
I
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!
(
Also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!
And
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)
She
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!
Food
Craving
Gone
and
Weight
Loss
at
Acupuncture
Doctor
I
am
a
college
student
.
Before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.
I
experienced
a
Definite
Decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.
I
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.
I
was
amazed
.
I
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.
Before
coming
to
Acupuncture
DOCTOR
I
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.
It
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.
What
I
like
most
about
Dr.
Liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.
She
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.
I
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.
I
am
SO
GLAD
to
have
found
Dr.
Liau
.
Now
I
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.
An
Asset
to
Richmond
For
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
Richmond
City
Limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.
Bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.
The
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
Flying
Squirrels
stadium
.
The
owners
of
Bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.
The
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.
There
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
I
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.
Best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!
Just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.
Expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.
But
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
Bowtie
.
The
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
Sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.
A
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.
Thank
you
,
Bowtie
!
Craft
Wonderland
with
History
My
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.
I
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.
I
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.
I
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.
The
owner
,
Jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!
What
a
history
.
She
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.
I
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
Oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.
This
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.
By
the
way
,
Salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.
Great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
Genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!
I
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
Hyundai
Genesis
.
I
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.
I
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.
I
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
Jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
I
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.
We
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
I
test
drove
with
Craig
and
I
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
I
kept
saying
,
"
was
I
got
ta
have
it
!
"
I
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
I
could
nt
be
happier
.
Jeff
and
Craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.
Definitely
go
see
them
!
Bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers
Called
the
Bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
I
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
I
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.
Was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.
No
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.
Will
look
beautiful
.
Got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
AND
it
's
$
125
PLUS
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.
I
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.
So
from
$
55
to
$
260
?
Are
they
serious
?
I
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
I
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
I
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
TIMES
the
price
?
Either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.
One
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.
Outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
The
Laundry
Tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
I
've
been
in
.
Yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.
I
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
I
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.
The
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
I
will
continue
my
patronage
of
The
Laundry
Tub
in
the
future
.
Did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.
Whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
Where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
At
the
checkout
line
at
WalMart
,
"
I
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
At
The
Laundry
Tub
.
"
Thank
you
!
I
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
Clinic
and
I
was
SHOCKED
at
how
well
Romeo
and
My
family
was
treated
.
They
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.
We
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
I
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
I
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
I
called
I
would
not
annoy
them
.
lol
They
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.
In
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
CARE
,
Not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.
I
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!
I
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
I
have
animals
.
I
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
I
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!
In
fact
I
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
I
are
treated
.
Okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.
I
'm
a
regular
at
the
HH
.
The
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.
I
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.
In
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.
However
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.
In
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.
They
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.
You
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.
Nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.
Trust
The
Midas
Touch
I
personally
trust
this
Midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
I
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!
the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.
This
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.
I
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!
Like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...
Midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
I
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!
maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.
I
will
continue
going
to
Dave
at
Midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!
When
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
Midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!
We
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.
Additionally
we
tried
the
Logan
Circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.
The
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
I
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
I
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.
The
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.
The
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.
The
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
TV
playing
football
.
But
I
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.
It
's
just
not
worth
it
.
Do
n't
Expect
Sleep
or
Courtesy
I
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
Oct
2007
.
At
3:15
am
on
night
#
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.
These
are
not
household
type
alarms
.
When
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.
I
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.
After
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
I
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.
The
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
I
would
make
that
up
?
)
.
He
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ADA
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.
This
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
I
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.
This
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.
Do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.
Poor
Service
,
Lack
of
Passion
:
Do
NOT
go
I
began
seeing
Dr.
Romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.
The
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
I
once
loved
about
the
office
.
It
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.
Also
,
I
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
Dr.
Romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
I
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.
Please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.
Save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.
The
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
Brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
NY
/
NJ
,
including
Fort
Lee
.
When
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
Brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.
That
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.
And
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.
So
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.
Guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.
I
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.
The
only
reason
I
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
I
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.
So
I
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.
One
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.
You
have
to
pay
CASH
ONLY
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.
Worst
Apartments
EVER
We
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.
Then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
Linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.
We
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.
The
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.
Then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.
Linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.
Do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!
The
Worst
Experience
Ever
!!!
I
have
worked
with
Ted
Jurek
at
Decor
and
You
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.
He
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
Ted
,
but
said
that
Ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.
I
figure
I
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.
However
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
NON
REFUNDABLE
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
I
was
sorry
I
did
.
We
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
Ted
was
late
.
He
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.
By
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
I
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.
Just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.
WHAT
IS
THAT
?????
This
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.
Please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
DECOR
and
YOU
working
with
every
budget
...
This
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket
Horrible
.
Horrible
.
When
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
I
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"
After
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"
Somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.
I
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.
He
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"
Sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.
When
I
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"
I
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.
I
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.
He
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.
Imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.
I
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.
He
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.
We
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.
Do
n't
stay
there
.
I
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
OWNER
also
.
My
friend
and
I
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.
We
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.
Unfortunalty
my
husband
and
I
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.
My
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
I
called
her
.
They
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.
I
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
Bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.
Times
are
hard
,
I
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.
I
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.
I
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.
In
one
of
the
emails
I
attached
the
letter
from
the
Vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.
I
even
emailed
Mackinaw
Tourist
and
nothing
.
I
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.
FANFUCKINGTASTIC
Ok
I
am
a
New
Yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
Oxford
,
England
.
I
thought
the
UK
was
completely
devoid
of
good
NYC
style
pizza
.
I
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
I
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.
I
thought
I
would
have
to
wait
until
I
went
home
to
NYC
.
Well
then
I
went
on
a
trip
to
Glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.
I
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
HOLY
GRAIL
.
I
knew
I
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.
They
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.
So
I
ordered
a
slice
.
It
tasted
like
I
just
flew
back
home
.
I
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
Scottish
friends
---
this
is
THE
REAL
DEAL
.
I
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
NYC
pizza
because
these
Scots
fcking
nailed
it
.
That
being
said
,
I
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.
They
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.
Good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management
We
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
We
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
Mama
Mia
's
on
Greenfield
Ave
.
The
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.
When
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
I
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
I
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)
I
then
asked
if
I
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.
The
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.
Her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.
Sorry
for
interrupting
I
guess
.
The
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
I
was
wasting
her
time
.
There
were
no
other
options
available
(
I
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.
I
will
not
be
visiting
Mama
Mia
's
again
.
There
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.
DINING
AT
TEXAS
ROADHOUSE
TEXAS
ROADHOUSE
HAS
VERY
GOOD
MEALS
,
THAT
THE
MEAT
COMES
RIGHT
OFF
THE
BONES
.
IT
HAS
VERY
GOOD
PRICES
.
ON
A
BAD
NOTE
THE
WAITING
AREA
IS
NOT
ENJOYABLE
OR
ENOUGH
SEATS
.
ALSO
,
THERE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
PEANUTS
ALL
OVER
THE
FLOOR
.
NEXT
,
THERE
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
ONE
PERSON
BRINGING
YOU
YOUR
FOOD
.
IT
S
NOT
A
BIG
DEAL
BUT
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
MY
SALAD
HOME
BECAUSE
THEY
FORGOT
TO
BRING
IT
.
I
HAD
TO
ASK
THE
GIRL
WHO
BROUGHT
MY
FOOD
AND
SHE
NEVER
CAME
BACK
TO
LET
ME
KNOW
.
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
FOR
MY
WAITRESS
.
WHEN
YOU
FIRST
COME
IN
THE
HOSTESS
IS
NOT
VERY
FRIENDLY
,
THERE
IS
JUST
A
BUNCH
OF
WORKERS
STANDING
THERE
.
I
WAS
THERE
ON
MARCH
6TH
,
2009
.
I
WAS
ALSO
THERE
OF
JULY
4TH
2008
,
WHEN
MY
DAUGHTER
S
BUFFALO
WINGS
CAME
OUT
WITH
A
FLY
ON
IT
.
THE
MANAGER
CAME
OVER
AND
SAID
HE
WAS
SORRY
AND
GAVE
A
NEW
BATCH
OF
WINGS
,
HE
SAID
WE
CA
NT
REALLY
DO
ANYTHING
BECAUSE
THE
DOORS
ARE
ALWAYS
OPENING
AND
CLOSING
.
IN
MY
OPINION
SHOULD
OF
JUST
TOOK
OFF
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
WINGS
FROM
THE
BILL
.
BUT
EVERYONE
HAS
THERE
OWN
WAY
!!!!!!
Mezza
Luna
FTW
!
their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.
it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.
it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.
also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.
that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.
it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.
their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.
they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.
anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.
it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

Edit
:
Living
on
campus
at
Clarkson
University
,
I
have
had
food
delivered
before
.
This
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
I
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.
Perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.
My
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.
I
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
XF
.
Michael
Chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
I
go
check
it
out
.
I
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
Michael
.
He
showed
me
the
car
I
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.
I
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
XF
.
The
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.
Fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.
10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
I
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
XF
.
I
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
I
have
to
say
the
experience
with
Michael
and
Barrett
Motor
Cars
of
San
Antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.
Friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.
That
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
Michael
and
Barrett
hit
all
3
.
Thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!
Identity
Theft
Myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.
We
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.
Luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.
It
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.
She
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.
The
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.
That
s
how
they
were
caught
.
They
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.
The
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.
Nobody
lived
there
.
A
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.
Short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.
My
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.
I
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.
Parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
Mini
Cooper
.
It
sucked
having
an
SUV
.
If
I
found
a
spot
,
I
could
nt
fit
in
it
.
Gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.
Bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.
The
best
there
is
in
service
.
I
was
recently
traveling
down
I
-
24
from
Nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
Murfreesboro
.
It
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
Bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.
Not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
Thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.
They
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
BMW
330i
in
Murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.
They
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
Murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.
Thanks
Bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.
It
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
I
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
Nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.
I
hope
I
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

Service
and
Client
base
not
ok
.
I
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.
I
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
I
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
I
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
AM
to
5
AM
during
my
last
stay
and
I
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.
I
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.
I
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.
I
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
I
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.
Was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.
He
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.
It
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.
He
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
I
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
I
have
ever
seen
.
Cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.
I
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.
I
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
I
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.
THIS
STORY
IS
100
%
TRUE
.
That
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss

*ss

Long
Lines
,
Silly
Rules
,
Rude
Staff
,
Ok
Food
The
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.
A
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?
I
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.
Well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.
The
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.
I
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
COMCAST
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.
And
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
French
,
a
jerk
.
If
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.
Save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.
I
suggest
you
go
up
to
Raging
Taco
&
Raging
Burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
Taco
Mac
.
Wish
this
was
in
Saratoga

We
were
introduced
to
Bistro
Tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
Adelphi
Hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
Paris
,
London
,
New
York
the
rest
of
the
year
.
SHE
KNOWS
GREAT
FOOD
AND
DINING
EXPERIENCES
.
She
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.
I
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
BT
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.
Our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.
This
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.
Treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!
I
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
Saratoga
Springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!
The
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!
Unlike
Saratoga
.
I
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.
Can
not
wait
to
go
gain
.

I
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.
First
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.
They
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.
I
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
I
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.
Usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.
The
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.
In
general
I
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.
But
then
again
I
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.
Anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.
If
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
St
.
It
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.
They
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.
First
trip
to
Canada
I
recently
traveled
to
Canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.
I
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
Canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.
This
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.
I
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.
I
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.
From
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
I
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.
I
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.
I
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
Novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.
Yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
NJ
I
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.
Please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
Staff
and
Management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.
Favorite
place

Tampa

Update
:
I
had
to
add
to
my
review
.
I
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.
AMAZING
!
I
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.
Well
I
was
in
for
a
treat
when
I
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
I
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.
Right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.
We
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.
After
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!
I
had
the
Chicken
Parmesan
Dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
Shrimp
Scampi
Dinner
.
AMAZING
!
The
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!
I
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.
It
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
Incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!
Bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.
Well
Done
!
Great
work
and
honest
establishment
!
I
typically
have
work
done
on
my
Jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.
I
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.
I
had
hear
great
things
about
Phet
and
G&G
Automotive
so
I
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.
The
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.
He
checked
out
what
I
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.
The
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
I
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
I
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.
Also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
Phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.
That
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!
I
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
I
moved
here
,
but
Phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.
He
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!
Our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.
We
had
been
evaluating
SEO
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
Stuart
,
and
Ulistic
.
We
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.
1
.
Social
Media
.
We
were
familiar
with
Search
Engine
Optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
Social
Media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.
2
.
We
really
liked
the
fact
that
Stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
Key
Performance
Indicators
.
How
has
it
gone
so
far
?
Well
we
have
been
working
with
Ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
Facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
SEO
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.
We
are
absolutely
confident
that
Stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.
Finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
Stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.
Excellent
service
and
quality
I
had
Hom
-
Excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
Tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.
The
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
I
'm
writing
my
review
.
Three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.
The
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.
Next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.
The
window
did
n't
break
!
My
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.
I
called
Home
-
Excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.
Lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.
Their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.
In
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.
I
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!
Friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems
May
,
2009
.
We
were
booked
at
the
Sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.
Got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!
Next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.
There
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.
In
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.
A
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.
They
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.
Security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.
A
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.
When
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.
The
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.
Be
Careful
Of
Who
Your
Sales
Guy
Is
I
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.
My
experience
was
awful
though
.
It
ALL
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.
I
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
I
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.
Essentially
,
I
told
him
I
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.
I
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
I
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.
After
that
,
I
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.
I
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
I
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.
For
instance
I
asked
who
owned
Mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
GM
,
which
is
n't
true
.
I
mean
,
I
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
BS
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
I
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.
The
Worst
Chinese
I
've
Ever
Had
This
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
I
have
ever
had
.
The
service
stunk
.
I
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.
They
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.
They
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.
She
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.
We
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.
Not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.
They
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.
We
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.
I
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
THAT
bad
but
China
Delight
accomplished
that
.
The
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.
I
will
NEVER
go
here
again
.
Lucky
Panda
in
Willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.
I
have
no
idea
how
China
Delight
won
number
1
Chinese
restaurant
in
Montgomery
-
There
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.
Terrible
Service
One
of
the
worst
experiences
I
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.
We
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.
Approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.
We
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.
We
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.
So
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.
When
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
I
'm
sorry
"
.
Nope
,
none
of
the
above
.
He
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.
It
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.
And
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.
At
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
I
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.
I
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
Sun
Devil
Auto
again
.
Well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.
Do
not
use
this
company
!
I
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
I
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.
I
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
I
dropped
off
.
They
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
I
needed
to
replace
.
I
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.
When
I
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
IT
WOULD
NOT
FIT
!!
I
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
I
had
to
complete
the
job
.
I
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
Pomper
for
my
money
back
.
The
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
I
could
not
believe
it
!
She
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
I
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
I
could
not
return
it
.
I
explained
I
did
not
get
what
I
paid
for
.
She
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
I
told
her
I
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.
She
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.
I
said
I
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
I
at
least
have
a
credit
.
With
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
NO
MONEY
IS
BEING
RETURNED
and
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
.
DO
NOT
USE
THIS
COMPANY
.
There
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!
I
would
NEVER
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.
When
I
originally
joined
in
January
I
only
did
so
because
I
was
told
I
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
I
was
to
move
away
.
I
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.
Actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.
The
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
I
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.
They
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
ASAP
.
Back
to
my
poor
rating
-
I
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
I
was
told
I
could
do
since
I
was
moving
away
.
The
owner
was
VERY
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
I
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.
I
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
I
would
not
have
to
pay
if
I
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.
I
would
understand
if
I
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
OWNER
?!
Bad
for
business
.
I
was
appalled
.
I
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.
The
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!
There
are
better
places

The
Salon
Experience
from
Hell
I
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.
Right
out
of
college
I
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.
Just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.
I
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.
I
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
LA
named
Derrick
.
After
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
I
should
warn
you
,
I
'm
expensive
.
"
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
,
say
I
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.
I
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.
The
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.
$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.
Derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
I
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.
I
cried
the
entire
way
home
.
He
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.
I
will
never
go
back
.
It
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
Hell
.
He
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.
That
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.
Maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.
Absolute
Nightmare
!
STAY
AWAY
!
Very
unhappy
...
Working
with
Rod
Jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
CPA
,
so
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.
That
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.
However
,
then
I
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
I
had
just
become
eligible
for
.
I
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
I
received
a
bill
for
MORE
than
what
I
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.
Asked
why
,
Rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
I
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.
Well
,
that
was
strike
one
.
I
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
I
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.
However
,
now
that
I
have
come
to
realize
that
I
am
going
to
owe
the
IRS
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
Rod
told
me
to
do
,
I
feel
I
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.
Last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
I
asked
Rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
He
said
yes
.
Well
,
again
,
I
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
April

and
all
that
Rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'
I
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
NOT
what
I
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.
In
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
THEY
LET
ME
DOWN
!
Bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times
I
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
I
own
from
this
place
.
Why
?
Because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
I
paid
in
cash
.
Sketchy
,
right
?
Well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.
(
They
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)
The
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
Ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.
Then
one
day
,
Ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
WITHOUT
informing
me
.
He
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
I
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.
The
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
I
still
had
this
table
coming
.
I
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.
I
came
back
with
the
receipt
Ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.
I
waited
.
And
waited
.
He
never
once
contacted
us
.
I
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.
He
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.
It
has
been
3
weeks
and
I
STILL
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
NOT
cheap
,
I
might
add
)
.
Point
is
:
You
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
I
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.
Poor
Service
Run
do
n't
walk
.
My
experience
with
Home
Delivery
Service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.
If
I
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
I
would
.
On
August
21st
,
2009
I
ordered
furniture
from
Hickory
Furniture
Mart
and
contracted
for
HDS
to
deliver
it
.
After
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.
I
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.
No
one
will
give
me
a
date
.
I
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.
Upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.
How
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.
After
complaining
on
September
10th
to
National
Home
Furnishings
,
Boyles
,
the
Hickory
Furniture
Mart
and
Home
Delivery
Service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.
The
customer
service
at
Home
Delivery
Service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.
So
I
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.
I
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.
Maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.
Excellent
Driving
School
I
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
I
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.
Unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.
A
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
Professional
Driving
School
and
I
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
Gerry
.
She
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
Saintly
Instructor
and
Simply
the
Best
Instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.
I
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
I
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.
I
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.
Five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
I
got
a
call
from
Gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
I
was
ready
.
My
heart
pounded
as
I
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
Gerry
in
an
SUV
-
Lexus
!
I
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
I
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
SUV
.
Gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
I
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.
I
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!
Trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"
.......
the
rest
was
history
!
Here
I
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.
Gerry
,
I
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.
To
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
Gerry
is
a
"
Saintly
Instructor
...
Absolutely
Simple
the
Best
Instructor
and
Best
Driving
school
there
is
!
Review
on
House
of
Joy
Chinese
Restaurant
My
family
and
I
moved
to
San
Antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
Chinese
Restaurants
because
we
love
Chinese
food
.
Well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.
But
we
do
n't
just
like
House
of
Joy
WE
LOVE
IT
.
Everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
San
Antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.
We
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
Bexar
County
Tax
Office
off
of
Bandera
Road
.
We
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.
They
have
the
best
Egg
Drop
Soup
I
have
ever
tasted
.
We
also
love
their
Egg
Rolls
and
Spring
Rolls
.
And
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.
Everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.
Their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.
The
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.
They
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.
You
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!
So
anyone
looking
for
an
Excellent
night
out
for
Chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
I
promise
you
2
things
---
You
wo
n't
regret
it
!!
and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

PS
I
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
I
will
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.
We
are
from
Virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.
So
that
comment
is
completely
false
.
Because
we
think
IT
'S
THE
BEST
!!!
and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.
Dr.
Strzalka
at
Flagship
CVTS
is
not
a
good
doctor
I
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
Dr.
Christopher
T.
Strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
CRUEL
AND
UNCARING
!!
He
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.
I
had
a
surgery
date
of
July
17
,
2008
.
Then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
Health
Care
Proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.
He
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.
Two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.
He
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.
A
Health
Care
Proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.
He
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.
Just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.
So
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.
I
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.
I
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.
Even
my
PA
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.
He
said
it
sarcastically
.
If
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.
What
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.
I
would
suggest
not
avoiding
Second
Home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.
I
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.
I
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.
It
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.
But
I
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
I
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.
Workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.
It
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.
You
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
I
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.
But
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.
You
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
Second
Home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
Second
Home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.
No
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?
My
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
I
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.
Be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.
Dumbest
F'ers
ever
I
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
I
get
put
on
hold
twice
without
saying
a
word
and
FINALLY
someone
says
,
MAY
I
HELP
YOU
?
So
I
say
:
I
'm
at
the
Radison
Warwick
hotel
in
Rittenhouse
Square
(
built
in
1926
)
do
you
deliver
to
the
Warwick
?
They
say
no
,
Warwick
in
New
Jersey
,
Call
New
Jersey
.
I
laugh
and
say
,
no
,
that
Warwick
is
in
New
York
,
but
I
'm
at
the
Radison
-
Warwick
.
And
he
says
:
You
're
at
Warwick
in
Pennsylvania
?
and
I
said
,
YES
,
CENTER
CITY
PHILLY
,
and
he
says
,
NO
,
Warwick
is
a
township
,
If
you
're
at
a
Radison
in
Warwick
that
s
too
far
,
try
dominos
in
Pottstown
.
I
say
,
NO
,
I
am
at
the
RADISON
WARWICK
HOTEL
in
Rittenhouse
Square
.
He
says
:
I
not
know
that
town
,
I
have
to
get
to
work
,
I
'm
in
PHILLY
.
Call
dominos
in
your
town
.
I
SAY
LISTEN
:
I
'm
at
17th
and
LOCUST
,
do
you
deliver
there
?
He
says
,
I
have
to
have
an
exact
ADDRESS
.
OK
,
1701
LOCUST
STREET
i
say
.
he
says
:
Why
you
tell
me
you
r
in
WARWICK
TOWNSHIP
?
He
gives
the
phone
to
a
girl
,
she
says
,
I
have
to
have
your
address
,
I
say
,
do
you
deliver
to
17th
and
locust
,
she
says
,
your
exact
address
,
I
say
1
-
7
-
0
-
1
Locust
,
ARe
you
sure
?
she
asks
?
YES
I
am
sure
,
well
,
she
says
,
is
that
ON
17th
STREET
.
Yes
,
I
say
.
17th
,
like
over
by
16th
and
15th
YES
,
I
say
,
one
mile
west
of
you
.
You
're
at
7th
.
I
am
just
south
of
Walnut
.
She
says
,
Is
that
17th
like
over
past
broad
.
YES
,
I
am
west
of
broad
.
Broad
,
I
say
,
is
14th
street
and
I
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.
Hmmm
,
she
says
,
Then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?
Anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
I
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
Geno
's
.
Quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!
B&B
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
June
.
They
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.
Our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
August
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
Workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.
Within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.
We
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.
We
heard
nothing
.
We
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.
I
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!
She
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
You
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"
Well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!
YES
!
I
WAS
calling
about
one
board
!!
I
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
WAS
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.
So
I
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
I
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
I
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!
STAY
AWAY
!!!
YOU
GET
WHAT
YOU
PAY
FOR
!!!
They
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
I
know
why
!!!
When
the
fence
was
first
installed
I
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!
Lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.
I
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
I
gave
up
.
I
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.
They
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
I
booked
.
The
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.
The
email
confirmation
(
which
I
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.
In
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.
However
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.
So
no
totes
.
Finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
M
,
no
exceptions
.
Then
she
was
gone
.
We
returned
after
3
PM
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

Snacks

I
'd
go
back
if
I
could
get
the
last
minute
rate
again
of
$
99
,
but
I
would
n't
pay
their
rack
rate
.
Quit
with
the
overstatements
!
The
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
Zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.
The
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.
It
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.
Now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.
The
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
I
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.
Though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.
That
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.
Then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.
Dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.
The
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.
The
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.
Dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
I
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.
I
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.
Oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.
The
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.
And
my
--
no
,
I
still
do
n't
remember
what
I
had
.
Service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.
Perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
Zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.
But
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.
PS
)
When
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.
When
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.
Did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?
MUST
READ
-
Do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.
At
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.
They
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
I
would
actually
look
like
were
I
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
I
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.
So
,
as
I
was
leaving
I
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.
They
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.
Hmmm
...
A
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
SUPPOSEDLY
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.
Do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???
They
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
STEALING
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.
I
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?
Whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
I
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.
What
a
waste
of
TIME
.
Aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
I
was
about
how
another
dress
that
I
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
I
was
trying
on
.
Somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
I
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
I
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
I
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
I
had
on
.
My
point
:
Even
if
I
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.
Say
something
like
,
"
Huh
.
I
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"
Unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.
Seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.
Other
shops
around
this
city
have
MUCH
NICER
and
more
TRANSPARENT
owners
.
Not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.
I
felt
very
much
like
Wedding
Gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
I
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
I
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.
AWFUL
SERVICE
!
After
happily
visiting
Sear's
Automotives
in
the
past
,
I
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
Greensboro
location
.
I
brought
my
car
in
on
a
Sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.
I
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
Sear's
use
)
.
Once
inside
,
I
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
FINALLY
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.
Once
I
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
I
spent
quite
a
bit
MORE
time
standing
around
waiting
.
I
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
I
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.
Once
I
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.
OK
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.
The
following
Friday
,
I
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.
I
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
I
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.
Once
again
,
I
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.
I
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
I
expected
.
He
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.
However
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
I
could
see
that
it
was
NOT
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.
So
I
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.
Ok
--
fine
.
So
I
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.
They
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
I
waited
in
the
lobby
.
Over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.
A
few
minutes
after
I
left
,
I
was
called
and
informed
that
"
I
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.
Of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
I
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.
Of
course
I
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.
The
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.
Of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
I
would
have
to
return
on
Monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
I
get
a
flat
)
.
On
Monday
I
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.
Supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
I
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.
The
employees
at
this
Sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
I
could
see
.
I
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed

How
do
people
look
at
and
experience
art
?
Which
elements
of
specific
artworks
do
they
focus
on
?
Do
museum
labels
have
an
impact
on
how
people
look
at
artworks
?
The
viewing
experience
of
art
is
a
complex
one
,
involving
issues
of
perception
,
attention
,
memory
,
decision-making
,
affect
,
and
emotion
.
Thus
,
the
time
it
takes
and
the
ways
of
visually
exploring
an
artwork
can
inform
about
its
relevance
,
interestingness
,
and
even
its
aesthetic
appeal
.
This
paper
describes
a
collaborative
pilot
project
focusing
on
a
unique
collection
of
17th
Century
Zurbarán
paintings
.
The
Jacob
cycle
at
Auckland
Castle
is
the
only
UK
example
of
a
continental
collection
preserved
in
situ
in
purpose-built
surroundings
.
While
studies
of
the
psychology
of
art
have
focused
on
individual
works
and
distinctions
between
representative
/
non-representative
topics
,
no
work
has
been
completed
on
the
aesthetic
appreciation
of
collections
or
of
devotional
themes
.
In
this
paper
,
we
report
upon
the
novel
insights
eye-tracking
techniques
have
provided
into
the
unconscious
processes
of
viewing
the
unique
collection
of
Zurbarán
artworks
.
The
purpose
of
this
pilot
study
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
different
written
interpretation
on
the
visual
exploration
of
artworks
.
We
will
discuss
the
potential
implications
of
these
techniques
and
our
understanding
of
visual
behaviours
on
museum
and
gallery
practice
.
The
project
brings
together
established
research
strengths
in
Spanish
art
history
,
experimental
psychology
,
digital
humanities
,
and
museum
studies
to
explore
,
using
eye-tracking
techniques
,
aesthetic
reactions
to
digital
representations
of
the
individual
Zurbarán
artworks
as
well
as
the
significance
of
the
collection
as
a
whole
.
Our
experience
of
art
develops
from
the
interaction
of
several
cognitive
and
affective
processes
;
the
beginning
of
which
is
a
visual
scan
of
the
artwork
.
When
regarding
an
artwork
,
a
viewer
gathers
information
through
a
series
fixations
,
interspersed
by
rapid
movements
of
the
eye
called
saccades
.
The
direction
of
saccades
is
determined
by
an
interaction
between
the
goals
of
the
observer
and
the
physical
properties
of
the
different
elements
of
the
scene
(
e.g.
colour
,
texture
,
brightness
etc
)
.
Importantly
,
studying
eye
movements
offers
an
insight
that
does
not
depend
on
the
participants
’
beliefs
,
memories
or
subjective
impressions
of
the
artwork
.
Previous
eye
tracking
research
has
highlighted
the
potential
to
transform
the
ways
we
understand
visual
processing
in
the
arts
(
see
for
example
Brieber
2014
;
Binderman
et
al.
,
2005
)
and
at
the
same
time
offers
a
direct
way
of
studying
several
important
factors
of
a
museum
visit
(
Filippini
Fantoni
et
al.
,
2013
;
Heidenreich
&
Turano
2011
;
Milekic
2010
)
.
Zurbarán
’s
cycle
of
Jacob
and
his
Sons
has
been
on
display
in
the
Long
Room
at
Auckland
Castle
for
over
250
years
.
It
is
the
only
cycle
to
be
preserved
in
purpose-built
surroundings
in
the
UK
,
and
one
of
very
few
of
its
kind
in
the
world
.
It
has
a
long
history
in
scholarship
(
Baron
&
Beresford
2014
)
,
but
many
key
aspects
of
its
production
and
significance
have
not
yet
been
fully
understood
.
In
this
study
we
used
eye-tracking
in
the
first
stage
of
exploring
audience
experience
of
the
extensive
Spanish
art
collections
of
County
Durham
,
of
which
the
13
Zurbarán
artworks
(
there
are
actually
only
12
Zurbarán
artworks
,
the
13th
Benjamin
,
is
a
copy
by
Arthur
Pond
)
are
a
key
part
of
,
to
investigate
the
ways
in
which
audiences
look
at
Spanish
art
,
how
aesthetic
experience
is
evaluated
and
whether
audiences
can
be
encouraged
to
approach
art
in
different
ways
.
This
pilot
project
primarily
investigated
how
participants
visually
explore
artworks
and
provides
new
insights
into
the
potential
eye-tracking
has
to
transform
the
ways
we
understand
visual
processing
in
arts
and
culture
and
at
the
same
time
offer
a
direct
way
of
studying
several
important
factors
of
a
museum
visit
,
namely
to
assess
the
effects
of
label
characteristics
on
visitor
visual
behaviour
.

Introduction
Tenured
and
tenure-track
university
faculty
play
a
special
role
in
determining
the
speed
and
direction
of
scientific
progress
,
both
directly
through
their
research
and
indirectly
through
their
training
of
new
researchers
.
Past
studies
establish
that
each
of
these
efforts
is
strongly
and
positively
influenced
through
various
forms
of
faculty
diversity
,
including
ethnic
,
racial
,
and
gender
diversity
.
As
an
example
,
research
shows
that
greater
diversity
within
a
community
or
group
can
lead
to
improved
critical
thinking
[
1
]
and
more
creative
solutions
to
complex
tasks
[
2
,
3
]
by
pairing
together
individuals
with
unique
skillsets
and
perspectives
that
complement
and
often
augment
the
abilities
of
their
peers
.
Additionally
,
diversity
has
been
shown
to
produce
more
supportive
social
climates
and
effective
learning
environments
[
4
]
,
which
can
facilitate
the
mentoring
of
young
scientists
.
Despite
these
positive
effects
,
however
,
quantifying
the
impact
of
diversity
in
science
remains
exceedingly
difficult
,
due
in
large
part
to
a
lack
of
comprehensive
data
about
the
scientific
workforce
.
Measuring
the
composition
and
dynamics
of
a
scientific
workforce
,
particularly
in
a
rapidly
expanding
field
like
computer
science
,
is
a
crucial
first
step
toward
understanding
how
scholarly
research
is
conducted
and
how
it
might
be
enhanced
.
For
many
scientific
fields
,
however
,
there
is
no
central
listing
of
all
tenure-track
faculty
,
making
it
difficult
to
define
a
rigorous
sample
frame
for
analysis
.
Further
,
rates
of
adoption
of
services
like
GoogleScholar
and
ResearchGate
vary
within
,
and
across
disciplines
.
For
instance
,
gender
representation
in
computing
is
an
important
issue
with
broad
implications
[
5
]
,
but
without
a
full
census
of
computing
faculty
,
the
degree
of
inequality
and
its
possible
sources
are
difficult
to
establish
[
6
]
.
Some
disciplines
,
like
political
science
,
are
organized
around
a
single
professional
society
,
whose
membership
roll
approximates
a
full
census
[
7
]
.
Most
fields
,
on
the
other
hand
,
including
computer
science
,
lack
a
single
all-encompassing
organization
and
membership
information
is
instead
distributed
across
many
disjoint
lists
,
such
as
web-based
faculty
directories
for
individual
departments
.
Because
assembling
such
a
full
census
is
difficult
,
past
studies
have
tended
to
avoid
this
task
and
have
instead
used
samples
of
researchers
[
8
–
11
]
,
usually
specific
to
a
particular
field
[
12
–
16
]
,
and
often
focused
on
the
scientific
elite
[
17
,
18
]
.
Although
useful
,
such
samples
are
not
representative
of
the
scientific
workforce
as
a
whole
and
thus
have
limited
generalizability
.
One
of
the
largest
census
efforts
to
date
assembled
,
by
hand
,
a
nearly
complete
record
of
three
academic
fields
:
computer
science
,
history
,
and
business
[
19
]
.
This
data
set
has
shed
considerable
light
on
dramatic
inequalities
in
faculty
training
,
placement
,
and
scholarly
productivity
[
6
,
19
,
20
]
.
But
,
this
data
set
is
only
a
single
snapshot
of
an
evolving
and
expanding
system
and
hence
offers
few
insights
into
the
changing
composition
and
diversity
trends
within
these
academic
fields
.
In
some
fields
,
yearly
data
on
faculty
numbers
and
composition
are
available
in
aggregate
.
In
computer
science
,
the
Computing
Research
Association
(
CRA
)
documents
trends
in
the
employment
of
PhD
recipients
through
the
annual
Taulbee
survey
of
computing
departments
in
North
America
(
cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey
)
.
Such
surveys
can
provide
valuable
insight
into
trends
and
summary
statistics
on
the
scientific
workforce
but
suffer
from
two
key
weaknesses
.
First
,
surveys
are
subject
to
variable
response
rates
and
the
misinterpretation
of
questions
or
sample
frames
,
which
can
inject
bias
into
fine-grained
analyses
[
21
,
22
]
.
Second
,
aggregate
information
provides
only
a
high-level
view
of
a
field
,
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
investigate
causality
[
23
]
.
For
example
,
differences
in
recruitment
and
retention
strategies
across
departments
will
be
washed
out
by
averaging
,
thereby
masking
any
insights
into
the
efficacy
of
individual
strategies
and
policies
.
Here
,
we
present
a
novel
system
,
based
on
a
topical
web
crawler
,
that
can
quickly
and
automatically
assemble
a
full
census
of
an
academic
field
using
digital
data
available
on
the
public
World
Wide
Web
.
This
system
is
efficient
and
accurate
,
and
it
can
be
adapted
to
any
academic
discipline
and
used
for
continuous
collection
.
The
system
is
capable
of
collecting
census
data
for
an
entire
academic
field
in
just
a
few
hours
using
off-the-shelf
computing
hardware
,
a
vast
improvement
over
the
roughly
1600
hours
required
to
do
this
task
by
hand
[
19
]
.
By
assembling
an
accurate
census
of
an
entire
field
from
online
information
alone
,
this
system
will
facilitate
new
research
on
the
composition
of
academic
fields
by
providing
access
to
complete
faculty
listings
,
without
having
to
rely
on
surveys
or
professional
societies
.
This
system
can
also
be
used
longitudinally
to
study
how
the
workforce
’s
composition
changes
over
time
,
which
is
particularly
valuable
for
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
policies
meant
to
broaden
participation
or
improve
retention
of
faculty
.
Finally
,
applied
to
many
academic
fields
in
parallel
,
the
system
can
elucidate
scientists
’
movement
between
different
disciplines
and
relate
those
labor
flows
to
scientific
advances
.
In
short
,
many
important
research
questions
will
benefit
from
the
availability
of
accurate
and
frequently-recollected
census
data
.
Our
study
is
organized
as
follows
.
We
begin
by
detailing
the
design
and
implementation
of
our
web
crawler
framework
.
Next
,
we
present
the
results
of
our
work
in
two
sections
.
The
first
demonstrates
the
validity
and
utility
of
the
crawler
by
collecting
census
data
for
the
field
of
computer
science
and
comparing
it
to
a
hand-curated
census
,
collected
in
2011
[
19
]
.
The
second
provides
an
example
of
the
type
of
research
enabled
by
our
system
and
uses
the
2011
and
2017
censuses
to
investigate
the
“
leaky
pipeline
”
problem
in
faculty
retention
.
Epistemic
pollution
Agents
can
rationally
choose
between
experts
only
if
the
criteria
that
distinguish
genuine
experts
from
charlatans
are
common
sense
or
widely
known
:
if
agents
are
to
satisfy
the
epistemic
conditions
on
responsibility
,
they
must
know
what
kinds
of
knowledge
they
must
utilize
to
guide
their
selection
of
sources
(
on
pain
of
infinite
regress
)
.
In
fact
,
many
,
if
not
all
,
the
markers
of
expertise
identified
by
philosophers
enjoy
widespread
recognition
.
The
fact
that
these
criteria
are
widely
known
,
however
,
offers
an
opportunity
to
those
who
would
use
them
for
deception
,
witting
or
unwitting
.
Since
expertise
must
be
assessed
through
indirect
markers
,
to
mimic
the
markers
of
expertise
is
to
mimic
expertise
[
17
]
.
We
live
in
an
epistemic
environment
that
is
heavily
and
deliberately
polluted
by
agents
who
use
mimicry
and
other
methods
as
a
means
of
inflating
their
pretense
to
expertise
.
This
fact
,
together
with
the
fact
that
such
deception
is
widely
known
to
occur
,
reduces
ordinary
people
’s
trust
in
expert
authority
and
diminishes
their
capacity
to
distinguish
reliable
from
unreliable
sources
.
For
instance
,
those
with
an
interest
in
deceiving
the
general
public
may
set
up
parallel
institutions
that
ostensibly
guarantee
expertise
,
taking
advantage
of
the
ways
in
which
these
parallel
institutions
mimic
legitimate
institutions
to
ensure
that
people
are
taken
in
.
There
are
some
egregious
examples
of
this
practice
in
the
field
of
health
care
.
For
example
,
a
small
number
of
doctors
set
up
the
American
College
of
Pediatricians
(
ACPeds
)
to
advocate
socially
conservative
viewpoints
related
to
child
health
care
.
Such
an
organization
is
surely
permissible
,
but
it
has
had
the
unfortunate
(
and
likely
intended
)
effect
of
muddying
debates
in
the
public
forum
by
misleading
people
into
thinking
that
the
college
speaks
for
the
pediatric
profession
at
large
.
Thus
,
when
ACPeds
issued
a
statement
condemning
gender
reassignment
surgery
in
2016
[
21
]
,
many
people
mistook
the
organization
’s
political
beliefs
for
the
consensus
view
among
United
States
pediatricians
—
although
the
peak
body
for
pediatric
workers
,
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
,
has
a
much
more
positive
view
of
gender
dysphoria
[
22
]
.
Insofar
as
the
larger
organization
,
with
a
broader
membership
base
,
can
be
expected
to
reflect
a
wider
range
of
expert
opinions
and
a
higher
degree
of
expertise
,
it
is
reasonable
to
give
its
views
greater
weight
than
those
of
the
smaller
organization
.
When
ACPeds
allows
or
encourages
the
impression
that
it
speaks
for
the
profession
,
it
introduces
an
epistemic
pollutant
.
A
yet
more
egregious
example
of
such
pollution
involved
collaborative
efforts
by
pharmaceutical
companies
and
the
publishing
giant
Elsevier
to
produce
publications
mimicking
peer-reviewed
journals
in
the
interest
of
promoting
the
companies
’
commercial
products
[
23
]
.
The
companies
hoped
to
leverage
the
prestige
of
Elsevier
with
these
fake
journals
to
endow
their
promotional
“
research
”
with
an
air
of
reliability
.
When
the
deceit
was
uncovered
,
however
,
the
effect
was
just
the
opposite
:
the
legitimacy
of
the
published
findings
was
not
enhanced
through
their
publication
by
Elsevier
,
but
rather
the
legitimacy
of
Elsevier
’s
publications
—
and
,
by
extension
,
all
academic
journals
—
was
diminished
through
their
dissemination
of
deceptive
and
commercially
interested
research
.
More
recently
,
institutions
of
academic
expertise
have
been
subject
to
a
large
and
growing
outbreak
of
so-called
predatory
journals
—
journals
that
will
publish
almost
anything
for
a
fee
.
Once
again
,
this
phenomenon
has
the
effect
of
making
peer-reviewed
journals
appear
less
legitimate
.
At
times
,
even
those
who
work
in
academia
may
be
unsure
of
a
particular
journal
’s
legitimacy
,
and
there
are
genuine
borderline
cases
.
For
example
,
the
Frontiers
contingent
of
journals
appears
legitimate
—
at
least
to
me
—
despite
the
fact
that
authors
are
expected
to
pay
a
publication
fee
.
8
Yet
some
Frontiers
journals
appear
to
have
engaged
in
bad
behavior
,
whether
for
profit
or
for
some
other
motive
.
Frontiers
in
Public
Health
controversially
published
articles
linking
vaccines
and
autism
[
24
]
and
questioning
the
link
between
HIV
and
AIDS
[
25
]
.
Whether
due
to
this
behavior
or
not
,
Jeffrey
Beall
decided
to
add
the
publisher
to
his
influential
(
but
now
sadly
unavailable
)
list
of
questionable
journals
[
26
]
.
The
controversy
surrounding
Beall
’s
decision
indicates
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
such
judgments
—
even
for
professionals
.
If
academics
with
expertise
in
relevant
fields
have
difficulty
assessing
whether
particular
journals
or
particular
publishers
are
legitimate
,
one
can
not
reasonably
expect
ordinary
people
to
make
such
judgments
.
If
their
confidence
in
scientific
findings
is
lowered
across
the
board
as
the
result
of
such
epistemic
pollution
,
one
can
hardly
blame
them
.
Since
conflicts
of
interest
are
a
reason
to
discount
expertise
,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
note
that
I
have
published

Epistemic
pollution
may
stem
not

from

knowledge
production
but
also
from
bad
behavior
by
legitimate

.

For
example
,
pollution
may
result
from
attempts
to
game
the
systems
put
in
place
to
track
expertise
.
Consider
institutions
with
a
credentialing
function
,
such
as
universities
,
bar
associations
,
or
peer
review
bodies
.
These
institutions
do
not
exist
solely
to
credential
experts
.
They
have
other
functions
,
and
these
functions
may
come
into
conflict
,
creating
pressures
to
inflate
credentials
.
For
example
,
universities
have
a
financial
incentive
to
inflate
the
expertise
of
their
academic
staff
,
thereby
increasing
their
rankings
,
bringing
in
grant
money
,
and
attracting
students
.
Systems
that
assess
expertise
can
be
manipulated
,
and
many
cases
of
such
manipulation
exist
—
take
the
recent
example
by
the
University
of
Malaysia
,
which
attempted
to
boost
metrics
by
urging
its
faculty
to
cite
one
another
[

]
.
For
this
reason
,
institutions
may
also
be
slow
to
investigate
accusations
of
fraud
,
and
they
may
try
to
keep
their
discoveries
in-house
to
protect
their
reputations
.

Cognitive
games
involve
a
number
of
different
games
working
aspects
of
human
cognition
,
while
proposing
the
intersection
between
the
sets
of
concepts
,
fun
and
cognition
,
for
the
improvement
of
cognitive
functions
.
The
attention
is
the
main
point
made
in
this
study
,
since
it
is
fundamental
to
the
learning
process
and
be
recurring
complaint
among
parents
and
teachers
in
schools
.
With
respect
to
the
contributions
of
digital
games
to
improvement
of
cognitive
processes
,
researchers
suggest
that
regular
practice
has
a
significant
influence
on
improving
the
performance
related
to
basic
visual
skills
(

;
on
the
ability
to
perceive
objects
simultaneously
(
Dye
&
Bavelier
,
2010
;
Feng
,
Spence
,
&
Pratt
,

)
;
and
on
the
ability
to
do
more
than
one
task
at
the
same
time
(
Boot
,
Kramer
,
Simons
,
Fabiani
,
&
Gratton
,

)
.
Other
studies
specifically
investigate
the
use
of
digital
games
in
the
school
context
and
suggest
potential
for
digital
game
use
to
improve
of
student
's
attention
span
at
preschool
age
(
Rueda
,
Checa
,
&
Cómbita
,

)
,
to
improve
overall
intelligence
capacity
of
elementary
school
children
(
Miller
&
Robertson
,

)
,
and
to
better
performance
of
working

ability
(

)
.
Considering
the
importance
of
the
proper
functioning
of
attention
,
because
of
its
involvement
in
the
regulation
of
thoughts
and
emotions
,
maintaining
the
performance
of
this
process
is
very
important
,
especially
in
school
,
where
the
child
must
acquire
content
in
an
environment
full
of
countless
distractors
.
The
study
in
question
focuses
on
the
attention
,
proposing
and
evaluation
in
the
context
of
the
classroom
.
Thus
,
it
suggests
the
use
of
digital
games
in
an
integrated
way
the
school
activities
in
the
classroom
.
The
games
have
features
like
increasing
challenges
,
rules
that
establish
what
can
and
can
not
be
done
,
and
involvement
of
the
player
in
the
quest
to
gain
skills
and
win
the
game
(
Kirriemuir
&
McFarlane

.
We
aim
to
investigate
the
contributions
of
the
use
of
a
system
that
integrates
cognitive
digital
games
to
a
database
,
of
the
Escola
do
Cérebro
,
for
monitoring
and
improvement
of
cognitive
skills
,
highlighting
the
attention
.
The
games
involve
challenges
and
rules
involving
the
exercise
of
cognitive
functions
,
especially
the
working
memory
,
attention
and
capacity
of
solving
problems
.
The
study
combines
qualitative
and
quantitative
approaches
.
It
collects
the
data
based
on
the
observation
of
the
proposed
interventions
as
well
as
interviews
conducted
with
participating
teachers
and
students
to
identify
their
perceptions
of
digital
games
’
contributions
to
the
learning
process
.
Furthermore
,
before
and
after
the
implementation
of
the
intervention
,
we
performed
a
D2
Test
of
attention
that
measures
selective
and
sustained
attention
,
as
well
as
visual
scanning
accuracy
and
speed
.
The
intervention
consisted
in
the
use
of
the
Escola
do
Cérebro
,
using
tablets
in
the
classroom
,
daily
for
a
period
of
five
weeks
.
The
sample
consisted
of
71
students
of
the
Application
School
of
Basic
Education
,
Federal
University
of
Santa
Catarina
,
aged
7
and
9
years
old
(
M
=
7.64
±
1.12
)
,
which
were
divided
into
two
groups
:
participant
and
control
.
The
first
(
n
=
31
)
participated
in
the
intervention
,
the
control
group
(
n
=
40
)
was
only
evaluated
using
the
test
before
and
after
the
same
time
interval
of
interventions
.
The
Escola
do
Cérebro
is
a
platform
that
integrates
seven
digital
games
into
a
database
.
The
application
allows
visualization
of
the
player
's
performance
and
offers
the
possibility
of
monitoring
by
teachers
.
Students
have
their
scores
measured
by
four
variables
:
time
,
speed
,
stability
and
accuracy
.
A
statistical
analysis
was
performed
based
on
the
application
of
the
paired
t-test
on
the
difference
of
the
overall
score
obtained
in
the
test
before
and
after
the
intervention
in
the
two
groups
.
The
difference
in
the
results
obtained
from
the
application
of
D2
Test
of
attention
before
and
after
was
statistically
significant
(
p
<
0.05
)
,
the
participant
group
had
mean
and
standard
deviation
60.23
(
64.75
)
respectively
,
while
the
control
group
was
20.00
(
42.65
)
.
The
result
indicates
significant
improvement
in
the
performance
of
the
sustained
attention
in
the
test
,
as
well
as
a
high
dispersion
,
which
reveals
a
variation
in
relation
to
the
performance
.
In
addition
,
students
participating
in
the
interview
reported
a
preference
for
games
that
involve
problem
solving
,
recognize
the
need
to
plan
actions
in
relation
to
their
importance
for
the
game
and
for
daily
activities
,
and
realize
improvements
in
the
ability
to
sustain
attention
.
The
teachers
observed
changes
after
the
intervention
,
emphasizing
the
greater
persistence
and
involvement
in
school
activities
,
and
in
some
students
,
improvement
in
the
ability
to
sustain
attention
.
From
this
,
we
conclude
that
an
intervention
based
on
cognitive
digital
games
offers
contributions
to
the
learning
process
and
improvement
of
sustained
attention
.
4.
Discussion
.
We
hypothesized
that
the
children
,
who
were
over
the
age
of
six
at
the
time
of
collection
,
would
have
adult-like
SI
interpretations
.
We
expected
that
the
use
of
a
training
session
and
then
the
format
of
the
question
would
guide
participants
towards
evaluating
pragmatic
felicity
over
providing
truth
value
judgments
,
and
would
result
in
adult-like
interpretations
.
Further
,
we
posited
that
if
our
initial
hypothesis
was
not
supported
,
and
in
fact
there
was
some
non-adult-like
performance
,
that
there
would
be
significant
variability
among
the
conditions
,
with
cardinal
numbers
having
the
highest
performance
and
some
the
weakest
.
On
the
surface
,
it
does
seem
as
if
there
is
variability
and
perhaps
a
larger
sample
size
or
more
items
could
lead
to
a
significant
finding
(
see
limitations
below
)
,
but
at
least
for
this
study
,
the
only
significant
finding
was
the
difference
between
cardinal
numbers
and
some
.
Significant
differences
were
not
observed
between
all
and
cardinal
numbers
or
all
and
some
.
4.1.
LIMITATIONS
AND
FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
.
This
study
is
limited
in
its
power
and
generalizability
.
It
serves
as
a
reminder
of
the
work
that
needs
to
be
completed
for
the
cross-linguistic
study
of
SI
in
particular
and
acquisition
more
generally
.
Bantu
languages
are
not
included
in
studies
of
acquisition
often
enough
despite
the
numerous
languages
in
this
linguistic
grouping
and
the
millions
of
people
using
them
.
Future
studies
need
to
include
more
participants
and
more
items
to
increase
power
.
Future
studies
should
also
include
a
larger
age
range
of
children
to
document
the
age
at
which
adult-like
performance
emerges
.
Related
cross-cultural
studies
have
resulted
in
insufficient
statistical
power
,
but
interesting
trends
(
e.g.
,
Nedwick
,
2014
)
.
Follow-up
studies
with
increased
stimuli
and
participants
are
needed
.
In
a
future
study
,
it
is
also
important
to
consider
if
additional
training
in
the
difference
between
reporting
on
felicity
and
truth
value
judgments
would
impact
results
,
or
if
more
naturalistic
experimental
conditions
(
e.g.
,
demonstrating
actions
using
real
objects
instead
of
two-dimensional
depictions
)
would
be
beneficial
.
Previous
studies
in
this
region
of
sub-Saharan
Africa
have
found
evidence
of
cultural
differences
in
testing
behavior
(
Hein
,
Reich
,
Marks
,
Thuma
,
&
Grigorenko
,
2016
)
.
The
current
study
is
too
small
to
make
strong
conclusions
with
regard
to
cultural
differences
and
experimental
methods
;
however
,
in
the
study
by
Hein
and
colleagues
it
was
found
that
children
responded
more
or
less
frequently
based
on
factors
such
as
stimuli
type
.
In
the
current
study
,
the
responses
from
two
children
were
not
included
because
they
responded
the
same
way
to
every
item
through
the
training
and
all
test
items
.
More
specifically
,
they
answered
“
yes
”
that
the
puppet
described
the
pictures
well
.
It
is
possible
that
these
two
children
understood
the
task
and
really
did
believe
that
the
puppet
did
not
produce
any
poor
descriptions
,
and
in
this
regard
,
are
not
yet
adult-like
in
their
SI
interpretations
.
This
is
unlikely
as
they
said
that
even
the
first
training
item
was
said
well
.
It
is
also
possible
though
that
these
two
children
were
attempting
to
please
the
data
collectors
,
or
be
polite
,
and
that
“
yes
”
was
in
some
ways
a
default
answer
to
be
provided
when
having
to
respond
verbally
in
a
test
context
.
Additional
training
with
the
methodology
could
improve
outcomes
.
The
puppets
used
were
picked
specifically
for
this
task
with
careful
attention
to
their
appearance
.
Upon
arrival
at
the
school
,
however
,
it
became
clear
that
the
children
were
not
accustomed
to
playing
with
puppets
and
that
the
data
collection
would
be
a
novel
experience
for
them
.
Further
exploration
with
greater
cardinal
number
ranges
could
also
prove
interesting
.
Numbers
through
five
in
the
participating
communities
are
most
often
expressed
with
native
Chitonga
words
while
numbers
greater
than
five
are
typically
indicated
using
English
borrowings
.
The
cardinal
numbers
included
in
this
study
were
only
one
through
five
in
order
to
avoid
additional
item
variability
,
but
larger
numbers
should
be
included
in
future
research
.
5.
Conclusion
.
Albeit
limited
,
these
results
provide
valuable
insight
into
SI
interpretation
by
Chitonga-speaking
children
and
demonstrate
that
pragmatic
inference
acquisition
likely
follows
the
order
identified
in
previous
research
,
but
appears
to
be
completed
at
a
later
age
in
this
language
.
This
interesting
combination
of
findings
–
expected
hierarchy
of
difficulty
,
but
differing
age
of
acquisition
–
is
an
important
addition
to
our
growing
cross-linguistic
knowledge
of
SI
and
could
be
the
result
of
language-specific
differences
in
the
use
of
SI
lexical
items
or
methodological
differences
.

Abstract
.
Today
’s
generation
will
not
survive
a
day
without
the
help
of
lighting
.
In
fact
,
someone
’s
productivity
,
particularly
at
night
,
depends
on
the
presence
of
a
good
lighting
and
it
seems
that
it
is
a
daily
necessity
.
Lighting
takes
a
large
part
on
the
consumption
of
household
electrical
energy
particularly
in
the
Philippines
.
There
are
different
type
of
lighting
bulbs
used
at
home
can
affect
the
overall
lighting
consumption
.
Nowadays
,
most
commonly
and
widely
used
bulb
in
the
household
is
the
Compact
Fluorescent
Light
(
CFL
)
.
However
,
the
main
problem
of
CFL
is
the
mercury
they
contain
.
In
addition
to
this
is
the
harmful

Introduction
Based
on
the
results
of
the
2011
Household
Energy
Consumption
Survey
(
HECS
)
,
electricity
remains
as
the
most
common
source
of
energy
used
by
households
particularly
in
the
Philippines
.
About
87
percent
of
21.0
million
households
used
electricity
from
March
to
August
2011
.
As
of
2016
,
the
demand
for
electricity
in
the
residential
is
leading
among
the
different
sectors
.
It
is
often
grouped
depending
on
its
uses
that
are
distributed
for
heating
and
cooling
,
lighting
,
operating
appliances
etc

Now
that
the
world
is
in
the
age
where
lighting
seems
to
be
a
daily
necessity
,
typical
homes
as
shown
in
figure
1
,
consume
nearly
27
percent
of
the
energy
used
today
:
making
lighting
as
the
major
source
of
electricity
consumption
.
Lighting
plays
a
large
part
on
the
consumption
of
household
electrical
energy
;
it
consumes
about
18
%
of
the
total
generated
electricity
of
total
energy
consumption
in
residential
sectors
as
shown
in
figure
2
[

.

.
Estimated
electricity
use
in
residential
sector
One
of
the
main
factors
in
lighting
energy
consumption
is
the
light
bulb
.
The
use
of
correct
and
appropriate
type
of
light
bulb
improves
the
efficiency
of
energy
usage
.
There
are
three
general
types
of
lighting
that
are
widely
used
in
the
household
nowadays
:
the
(
light-emitting
diode
)
LED
bulb
,
(
compact
fluorescent
light
)
CFL
bulb
and
the
incandescent
bulb
.
But
each
of
them
has
their
perks
and
perils
[

]
.
Unfortunately
,
most
of
the
time
,
people
in
the
residential
end
up
choosing
a
lamp
based
on
it
is
price
rather
than
its
efficiency
and
this
cause
us
to
pay
for
our
lighting
more
than
necessary
.
Today
,
CFLs
are
the
most
used
lighting
sources
in
the
household
.
Using
CFLs
will
allow
people
to
decrease
their
energy
consumption
;
also
it
is
a
good
start
to
decrease
greenhouse
emissions
.
However
,
the
main
problem
of
CFLs
is
the
mercury
they
contain
.
When
products
and
wastes
containing
mercury
are
improperly
disposed
of
,
mercury
is
released
into
the
air
,
ground
or
water
.
It
is
persistent
in
the
environment
;
it
never
breaks
down
nor
goes
away
.
In
addition
to
the
harmful
effects
of
mercury
is
that
it
emits
Ultraviolet
(
UV
)
Radiation
.
This
UV
radiation
interacts
with
the
chemicals
on
the
inside
of
the
bulb
to
generate
light
.
The
acute
and
chronic
effects
are
the
normal
responses
of
the
skin
to
UVR
;
acute
reactions
considered
will
be
erythema
(
sunburn
)
and
vitamin
D
production
.
Skin
aging
and
skin
cancer
will
be
discussed
as
those
reactions
produced
by
prolonged
or
repeated
UVR

Abstract
:
In
this
article
,
we
propose
the
definition
of
specific
mutation
operators
for
testing
Geographic
Information
Systems
.
We
describe
the
process
for
applying
the
operators
and
generating
mutants
,
and
present
a
case
study
where
these
mutation
operators
are
applied
to
two
real-world
applications
.

Introduction
Mutation-based
testing
[
1
]
is
a
test
technique
that
involves
artificially
introducing
errors
into
a
System
Under
Test
(
SUT
)
.
A
mutant
is
a
copy
of
the
system
in
which
a
change
has
been
done
that
,
in
most
cases
,
will
lead
to
a
behaviour
different
than
expected
.
The
different
mutants
are
generated
automatically
by
the
application
of
mutation
operators
.
In
the
state
of
the
art
,
we
have
found
mutation
operators
,
both
general
purpose
and
specific
to
different
technologies
,
languages
and
paradigms
[
2
–
9
]
.
However
,
these
operators
are
not
adequate
when
trying
to
test
software
features
associated
with
specific
domains
.
In
this
article
,
we
propose
mutation
operators
specific
to
the
domain
of
Geographic
Information
Systems
(
GIS
)
applications
.
These
operators
reproduce
programming
errors
that
are
litely
to
occur
during
the
development
of
this
type
of
applications
.
In
addition
,
we
present
the
implementation
of
these
operators
and
as
proof
of
concept
we
apply
these
operators
to
two
real-world
GIS
applications
and
we
generate
the
mutants
.
2.
Mutation
Operators
for
GIS
As
a
previous
step
to
designing
the
mutation
operators
,
we
analyzed
the
main
technologies
used
specifically
in
the
development
of
GIS
,
and
we
identified
typical
errors
a
programmer
can
introduce
during
the
development
.
These
errors
were
formalized
into
mutation
operators
.
In
order
to
apply
these
operators
to
a
SUT
,
we
rely
on
Java
reflection
and
aspect-oriented
programming
.
Reflection
allows
us
to
obtain
the
list
of
classes
and
methods
of
the
SUT
,
so
the
user
can
decide
the
methods
to
wish
the
operators
will
be
applied
.
Later
,
we
capture
information
about
the
methods
of
the
SUT
to
be
mutated
,
together
with
the
information
of
the
mutation
operators
that
were
already
defined
.
From
these
data
,
we
generate
the
mutation
operator
,
in
the
form
of
on
aspect
,
which
will
then
be
possible
to
interweave
with
the
SUT
which
generates
a
mutant
of
the
SUT
.
Next
,
we
describe
the
definition
of
two
operators
and
two
cases
of
application
on
real-world
GIS
applications
.
ChangeCoordSys
Operator
(
Listing
1
)
:
It
exchanges
the
coordinate
system
of
a
geometry
,
so
it
does
not
match
the
coordinate
system
that
is
being
used
in
the
user
interface
.
It
simulates
the
error
of
not
checking
that
the
coordinate
system
is
correct
.
The
error
is
introduced
by
directly
modifying
the
coordinate
system
of
geometry
when
recovering
the
wrapping
of
the
figure
.
Listing
1
:
A
simplified
definition
of
the
ChangeCoordSys
Operator
.
This
operator
was
applied
to
a
mobile
technology
GIS
application
.
This
application
allows
registering
places
of
interest
for
the
user
.
These
areas
of
interest
are
called
Geofences
.
A
Geofence
is
determined
by
a
geographical
location
expressed
in
terms
of
latitude
,
longitude
,
and
a
radius
around
that
location
.
By
creating
a
Geofence
with
an
erroneous
location
from
its
central
location
,
the
device
will
receive
incorrect
location
notifications
.
As
a
result
,
the
user
will
see
in
the
application
’s
map
viewer
the
Geofences
drawn
in
erroneous
zones
(
Figure
1
)
.

BooleanPolygonConstraint
Operator
(
Listing
2
)
:
It
introduces
errors
in
the
processing
of
geometries
,
manipulating
the
result
of
the
operations
that
carry
out
the
verification
of
different
topological
restrictions
between
geometries
,
such
as
intersects
,
covers
or
overlap
.
Listing
2
:
A
simplified
definition
of
the
BooleanPolygonConstraint
Operator
.
To
test
this
operator
it
was
applied
to
a
land
reparcelling
system
.
The
objective
of
the
land
reparcelling
is
to
reunify
the
lands
of
an
owner
to
facilitate
their
exploitation
.
In
this
application
,
the
result
of
the
operation
between
two
polygons
has
been
affected
.
This
error
causes
the
incorrect
display
of
the
resulting
geometry
that
should
be
drawn
in
the
user
interface
after
the
operation
applied
to
the
two
initial
geometries
(
Figure
2
)
.

Conclusions
In
existing
proposals
,
we
can
find
both
generic
and
specific
mutation
operators
.
However
,
these
are
not
adequate
to
cover
errors
in
particular
domains
.
We
have
defined
new
operators
specific
to
the
GIS
domain
and
a
way
to
apply
them
to
a
SUT
.
In
addition
,
we
have
tested
the
operators
defined
in
two
GIS
applications
.
As
future
work
,
we
intend
to
extend
this
approach
to
other
domains
,
as
well
as
to
use
the
developed
operators
for
the
automatic
improvement
of
sets
of
test
cases
.
Replication
in
Second
Language
Research
:
Narrative
and
Systematic
Reviews
and
Recommendations
for
the
Field
Replication
studies
are
considered
by
many
to
play
a
fundamental
role
in
any
scientific
endeavor
.
When
using
the
same
materials
and
procedures
as
a
previous
study
,
replication
studies
serve
to
test
the
reliability
of
the
previous
study
’s
findings
.
When
altering
specific
methodological
or
participant
characteristics
of
a
previous
study
,
they
serve
to
test
generalizability
of
the
earlier
findings
under
different
conditions
.
One
indication
of
the
importance
of
replication
is
found
in
the
50
or
more
calls
for
replication
research
in
the
field
of
second
language
(
L2
)
research
alone
(
see
references
for
50
calls
and
commentaries
in
Appendix
S1
in
the
Supporting
Information
online
)
:
from
Santos
(
1989
)
through
Polio
and
Gass
1997
to
very
recent
proposals
for
specific
replication
studies
,
such
as
Vandergrift
and
Cross
2017
and
even
a
book-length
treatment
(
Porte
,
2012
)
.
Beyond
these
calls
,
efforts
to
actively
promote
and
facilitate
replication
studies
have
also
emerged
.
For
example
,
the
Instruments
for
Research
into
Second
Languages
(
IRIS
)
repository
(
http://www.irisdatabase.org
)
was
established
in
2011
and
holds
,
at
the
time
of
writing
,
over
3,800
materials
that
can
be
used
for
replication
,
among
other
purposes
,
in
L2
research
(
Marsden
&
Mackey
,
2014
;
Marsden
,
Mackey
,
&
Plonsky
,
2016
)
.
The
Open
Science
Framework
(
https://osf.io
)
,
also
established
in
2011
,
provides
a
web
infrastructure
to
facilitate
collaboration
and
has
been
used
for
large
replication
efforts
in
psychology
(
e.g.
,
Open
Science
Collaboration
,
2015
)
,
which
continue
to
make
waves
in
academia
(
Laws
,
2016
;
Lindsay
,
2015
;
Martin
&
Clarke
,
2017
)
and
the
general
media
(
Baker
,
2015
;
Devlin
,
2016
)
.
In
some
fields
,
a
flourishing
metascience
,
that
is
,
the
scientific
study
of
science
(
see
Munafò
et
al.
,
2017
)
,
has
included
syntheses
assessing
the
quantity
and
nature
of
replication
efforts
,
for
example
,
in
education
(
Makel
&
Plucker
,
2014
and
in
psychology
(
Makel
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
The
driving
force
behind
this
battery
of
calls
,
commentaries
,
infrastructure
,
and
metascience
is
a
perceived
crisis
in
the
state
of
replication
research
.
The
severe
concerns
underpinning
the
alleged
crisis
have
several
dimensions
relating
to
:
(a)
the
(
small
)
amount
of
published
replication
research
;
(b)
the
(
poor
)
quality
of
replication
research
;
and
(c)
the
(
lack
of
)
reproducibility
,
which
refers
to
the
extent
to
which
findings
can
(
not
)
be
reproduced
in
replication
attempts
that
have
been
undertaken
.
These
concerns
speak
to
the
very
core
of
science
,
raising
fundamental
questions
about
the
validity
and
reliability
of
our
work
.
Indeed
,
some
commentators
have
called
replication
the
“
gold
standard
”
of
research
evidence
(
Jasny
,
Chin
,
Chong
,
&
Vignieri
,
2011
,
p.
1225
)
and
a
“
linchpin
of
the
scientific
process
”
(
Let
’s
replicate
,
2006
,
p.
330
)
.
In
the
field
of
L2
research
,
given
the
importance
of
replication
and
the
50
calls
for
replication
in
L2
research
that
we
identified
,
one
might
expect
a
substantial
number
of
published
replication
studies
by
now
.
However
,
a
perceived
lack
of
prestige
,
excitement
,
and
originality
of
replication
plagues
L2
research
(
Porte
,
2012
)
,
as
it
does
other
disciplines
(
Berez-Kroeker
et
al.
,
2017
;
Branco
,
Cohen
,
Vossen
,
Ide
,
&
Calzolari
,
2017
;
Chambers
,
2017
;
Schmidt
,
2009
)
,
and
these
perceptions
are
thought
to
have
caused
,
at
least
in
part
(
directly
or
indirectly
)
,
alleged
low
rates
and
a
poor
quality
of
published
replication
studies
.
However
,
a
systematic
metascience
on
replication
research
has
not
yet
been
established
in
the
field
of
L2
research
,
leaving
a
poor
understanding
of
the
actual
number
and
nature
of
replication
studies
that
have
been
published
.
The
current
study
begins
to
address
this
gap
through
narrative
and
systematic
reviews
.
The
narrative
review
considers
challenges
in
replication
research
and
is
largely
informed
by
commentaries
and
metascience
from
psychology
,
given
that
the
cognitive
and
social
subdomains
of
psychology
are
highly
influential
in
L2
research
,
and
also
from
education
,
another
key
sister
discipline
.
The
narrative
review
is
organized
around
four
broad
themes
:
(a)
the
quantity
of
replication
research
,
(b)
the
nature
of
replication
research
,
(c)
the
relationship
between
initial
and
replication
studies
,
and
(d)
the
interpretation
and
extent
of
reproducibility
of
the
findings
of
initial
studies
.
To
gain
insight
into
these
issues
in
the
context
of
L2
research
,
the
systematic
review
provides
a
synthesis
of
L2
studies
in
journal
articles
that
self-labeled
as
replications
.
The
research
questions
and
methods
of
the
systematic
review
were
largely
determined
by
the
narrative
review
but
also
emerged
through
the
design
and
piloting
of
the
coding
instrument
.
Finally
,
we
offer
further
discussion
and
16
recommendations
for
future
replication
work
that
draw
on
our
narrative
and
systematic
reviews
and
on
our
experience
of
carrying
out
multisite
(
Morgan-Short
et
al.
,
2018
)
1
and
single
site
(
Faretta-Stutenberg
&
Morgan-Short
,
2011
;
Marsden
,
Williams
,
&
Liu
,
2013
;
McManus
&
Marsden
,
2017
;
Morgan-Short
,
Heil
,
Botero-Moriaty
,
&
Ebert
,
2012
)
replications
.
We
start
from
the
widely
agreed
premise
that
testing
the
reproducibility
of
findings
should
have
an
essential
role
in
the
testing
and
refinement
of
theory
,
at
least
for
hypothesis-testing
epistemologies
that
seek
to
ascertain
generalizability
and
for
other
epistemologies
in
which
constructs
are
deemed
to
be
definable
and
observable
.
Thus
,
our
overall
aim
is
to
provide
conceptual
clarification
and
an
empirical
base
for
future
discussion
and
production
of
replication
studies
,
with
a
view
to
improving
the
amount
and
quality
of
L2
replication
research
.
Re(a)d
Wedding
:
A
Comparative
Discourse
Analysis
of
Fan
Responses
to
Game
of
Thrones
It
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
HBO
’s
Game
of
Thrones
is
more
than
just
a
television
series
or
a
successful
brand
:
it
is
a
transmedia
system
in
the
sense
first
used
by
Marsha
Kinder
(
1991
)
and
popularized
by
Henry
Jenkins
(
2006
)
,
in
which
media-hopping
networks
of
intertextualities
extend
the
“
storyworld
”
of
an
original
production
.
Now
spanning
six
seasons
and
60
episodes
,
with
an
average
global
viewership
(
from
its
most
recent
season
)
of
25.1
million
viewers
per
episode
(
Shepherd
,
2016
)
,
it
has
spawned
five
video
games
,
a
graphic
novel
adaptation
,
several
companion
books
,
two
rap
albums
,
a
28-city
orchestral
tour
,
a
wide
variety
of
tabletop
games
,
toys
,
merchandise
and
mobile
apps
,
and
countless
podcasts
,
fanfics
and
other
fan-based
creations
.
Given
the
volume
of
content
this
represents
,
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
the
television
series
itself
is
an
adaptation
of
a
book
series
with
a
pre-existing
fandom
.
As
such
,
the
Game
of
Thrones
storyworld
represents
a
remarkably
rich
and
challenging
environment
for
fans
old
and
new
,
who
must
negotiate
an
increasingly
complex
network
of
paratexts
and
intertexts
in
order
to
fully
engage
with
its
narratives
.
In
this
sense
,
fans
of
the
series
represent
an
emerging
model
for
cultural
consumption
that
should
be
carefully
explored
.
Transmedia
systems
,
like
that
exemplified
by
Game
of
Thrones
,
are
becoming
increasingly
prevalent
(
e.g.
,
Star
Wars
,
Harry
Potter
,
The
Walking
Dead
,
the
Marvel
Cinematic
Universe
,
etc
)
;
these
systems
demonstrate
,
in
microcosm
,
the
global
challenge
of
managing
the
fire-hose
flow
of
information
in
contemporary
postdigital
society
.
The
study
of
how
people
,
as
fans
,
access
and
manage
information
within
a
transmedia
system
provides
valuable
insight
that
contributes
not
only
to
practitioners
and
scholars
of
the
media
industry
,
but
to
the
wider
context
of
cultural
studies
,
by
offering
findings
on
this
new
model
of
the
fan
as
consumer
and
information-user
.
For
us
,
as
digital
humanists
,
defining
the
“
transmedia
fan
”
is
of
particular
relevance
as
we
seek
to
understand
contemporary
social
and
cultural
transformations
engendered
by
digital
technologies
.
Methodology
As
a
first
step
in
defining
the
“
transmedia
fan
”
,
the
current
project
undertakes
a
comparative
discourse
analysis
of
online
conversations
of
Game
of
Thrones
fans
.
One
of
the
most
dramatic
plot
developments
in
the
source
material
(
Martin
,
2000
)
was
adapted
to
the
screen
in
the
penultimate
episode
of
the
third
season
,
“
The
Rains
of
Castamere
”
(
Benioff
&
Weiss
,
2013
)
.
Readers
of
the
book
series
had
long
anticipated
and
dreaded
the
events
of
the
“
Red
Wedding
”
,
while
fans
of
the
show
unfamiliar
with
Martin
’s
narrative
were
largely
taken
unawares
by
the
pivotal
episode
.
Since
the
television
series
’
inception
,
writers
at
The
AV
Club
have
written
two
critical
reviews
for
each
episode
:
one
for
viewers
familiar
with
the
books
(
i.e.
,
“
Experts
”
)
and
one
for
viewers
unfamiliar
with
the
books
and
averse
to
“
spoilers
”
(
i.e.
,
“
Newbies
”
)
.
What
results
are
two
completely

”
which
in
turn
document
the

’
reactions
to
the
episode
in
the
form
of

:
one

where
fans
were
expected
to
be
shocked
by
the
outcome
of
the
episode
and
one
comment
thread
where
fans
had
hotly
anticipated
it
.
As
a
pilot
project
,
the
current
work
takes
the
content
of
both
comment
threads
—
a
corpus
of
approximately
5,600
comments
—
and
analyzes
each
thread
separately
using
a
qualitative
coding
method
aligned
with
constructivist

theory
(

)
.
Through
this
analysis
,
a
categorization
of
themes
emerges
illustrating
tactics
for
negotiating
intertexts
and
paratexts
unique
to
each
group
of
fans
.
These
themes
fall
under
two
broad
categories
:
negotiation
(
i.e.
,
emotional
responses
)
and
tactical
negotiation
(
i.e.
,
cognitive
,
or
reasoned
responses
)
.
A
comparison
of
categories
and
sub-categories
between
both
groups
provides
preliminary
findings
to
support
an
emergent
model
,
or
models
,
of
the
“
transmedia
fan
”
.
Conclusion
The
present
research
represents
a
first
step
in
exploring
the
impact
of
transmedia
systems
,
as
exemplified
by
Game
of
Thrones
,
through
the
study
of
fans
.
The
question
posed
by
this
research
is
,
fundamentally
,
an
examination
of
how
the
problem
of
“
access
”
is
framed
in
postdigital
society
from
the
perspective
of
the
consumer
.
Future
research
should
explore
the
negotiation
tactics
observed
in
transmedia
fans
using
the
principles
of
De
Certeau
’s
(
1984
)
everyday
life
practice
,
in
order
to
extend
its
application
to
the
broader
context
of
modern-day
consumers
.
The
current
study
will
contribute
to
the
development
of
further
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
that
will
more
clearly
define
the
information
behaviors
of
the
transmedia
fan
.
This
project
is
of
relevance
to
researchers
in
media
studies
,
fan
studies
,
information
studies
and
digital
humanities

(
German
pronunciation

;

February

–
17
March

)
was
a
Swiss
mathematician
and
physicist
and
was
one
of
the
many
prominent
mathematicians
in
the
Bernoulli
family
.
He
is
particularly
remembered
for
his
applications
of
mathematics
to
mechanics
,
especially
fluid
mechanics
,
and
for
his
pioneering
work
in
probability
and
statistics
.
His
name
is
commemorated
in
the
Bernoulli
's
principle
,
a
particular
example
of
the
conservation
of
energy
,
which
describes
the
mathematics
of
the
mechanism
underlying
the
operation
of
two
important
technologies
of
the
20th
century
:
the
carburetor
and
the
airplane
wing
.
Daniel
Bernoulli
Early
life
Frontpage
of
Hydrodynamica
(
1738
)
Daniel
Bernoulli
was
born
in
Groningen
,
in
the
Netherlands
,
into
a
family
of
distinguished
mathematicians
.
The
Bernoulli
family
came
originally
from
Antwerp
,
at
that
time
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
,
but
emigrated
to
escape
the
Spanish
persecution
of
the
Huguenots
.
After
a
brief
period
in
Frankfurt
the
family
moved
to
Basel
,
in
Switzerland
.
Daniel
was
a
son
of
Johann
Bernoulli
(
one
of
the
"
early
developers
"
of
calculus
)
and
a
nephew
of
Jacob
Bernoulli
(
who
"
was
the
first
to
discover
the
theory
of
probability
"
)
.
He
had
two
brothers
,
Niklaus
and
Johann
II
.
Daniel
Bernoulli
was
described
by
W.
W.
Rouse
Ball
as
"
by
far
the
ablest
of
the
younger
Bernoullis
"
.
He
is
said
to
have
had
a
bad
relationship
with
his
father
.
Upon
both
of
them
entering
and
tying
for
first
place
in
a
scientific
contest
at
the
University
of
Paris
,
Johann
,
unable
to
bear
the
"
shame
"
of
being
compared
Daniel
's
equal
,
banned
Daniel
from
his
house
.
Johann
Bernoulli
also
plagiarized
some
key
ideas
from
Daniel
's
book
Hydrodynamica
in
his
own
book
Hydraulica
which
he
backdated
to
before
Hydrodynamica
.
Despite
Daniel
's
attempts
at
reconciliation
,
his
father
carried
the
grudge
until
his
death
.
Around
schooling
age
,
his
father
,
Johann
,
encouraged
him
to
study
business
,
there
being
poor
rewards
awaiting
a
mathematician
.
However
,
Daniel
refused
,
because
he
wanted
to
study
mathematics
.
He
later
gave
in
to
his
father
's
wish
and
studied
business
.
His
father
then
asked
him
to
study
in
medicine
,
and
Daniel
agreed
under
the
condition
that
his
father
would
teach
him
mathematics
privately
,
which
they
continued
for
some
time
.
Daniel
studied
medicine
at
Basel
,
Heidelberg
,
and
Strasbourg
,
and
earned
a
PhD
in
anatomy
and
botany
in
1721
.
He
was
a
contemporary
and
close
friend
of
Leonhard
Euler
.
He
went
to
St.
Petersburg
in
1724
as
professor
of
mathematics
,
but
was
very
unhappy
there
,
and
a
temporary
illness
in
1733
gave
him
an
excuse
for
leaving
St.
Petersburg
.
He
returned
to
the
University
of
Basel
,
where
he
successively
held
the
chairs
of
medicine
,
metaphysics
,
and
natural
philosophy
until
his
death
.
In
May
,
1750
he
was
elected
a
Fellow
of
the
Royal
Society
.
Mathematical
work
His
earliest
mathematical
work
was
the
Exercitationes
(
Mathematical
Exercises
)
,
published
in
1724
with
the
help
of
Goldbach
.
Two
years
later
he
pointed
out
for
the
first
time
the
frequent
desirability
of
resolving
a
compound
motion
into
motions
of
translation
and
motion
of
rotation
.
His
chief
work
is
Hydrodynamica
,
published
in
1738
;
it
resembles
Joseph
Louis
Lagrange
's
Mécanique
Analytique
in
being
arranged
so
that
all
the
results
are
consequences
of
a
single
principle
,
namely
,
conservation
of
energy
.
This
was
followed
by
a
memoir
on
the
theory
of
the
tides
,
to
which
,
conjointly
with
the
memoirs
by
Euler
and
Colin
Maclaurin
,
a
prize
was
awarded
by
the
French
Academy
:
these
three
memoirs
contain
all
that
was
done
on
this
subject
between
the
publication
of
Isaac
Newton
's
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica
and
the
investigations
of
Pierre-Simon
Laplace
.
Bernoulli
also
wrote
a
large
number
of
papers
on
various
mechanical
questions
,
especially
on
problems
connected
with
vibrating
strings
,
and
the
solutions
given
by
Brook
Taylor
and
by
Jean
le
Rond
d'Alembert
.
Together
Bernoulli
and
Euler
tried
to
discover
more
about
the
flow
of
fluids
.
In
particular
,
they
wanted
to
know
about
the
relationship
between
the
speed
at
which
blood
flows
and
its
pressure
.
To
investigate
this
,
Daniel
experimented
by
puncturing
the
wall
of
a
pipe
with
a
small
open
ended
straw
and
noted
that
the
height
to
which
the
fluid
rose
up
the
straw
was
related
to
fluid
's
pressure
in
the
pipe
.
Soon
physicians
all
over
Europe
were
measuring
patients
'
blood
pressure
by
sticking
point-ended
glass
tubes
directly
into
their
arteries
.
It
was
not
until
about
170
years
later
,
in
1896
that
an
Italian
doctor
discovered
a
less
painful
method
which
is
still
in
use
today
.
However
,
Bernoulli
's
method
of
measuring
pressure
is
still
used
today
in
modern
aircraft
to
measure
the
speed
of
the
air
passing
the
plane
;
that
is
its
air
speed
.
Taking
his
discoveries
further
,
Daniel
Bernoulli
now
returned
to
his
earlier
work
on
Conservation
of
Energy
.
It
was
known
that
a
moving
body
exchanges
its
kinetic
energy
for
potential
energy
when
it
gains
height
.
Daniel
realised
that
in
a
similar
way
,
a
moving
fluid
exchanges
its
kinetic
energy
for
pressure
.
Mathematically
this
law
is
now
written
:
½
ρ
u
2
+
P
=
constant
where
P
is
pressure
,
ρ
is
the
density
of
the
fluid
and
u
is
its
velocity
.
A
consequence
of
this
law
is
that
if
the
velocity
increases
then
the
pressure
falls
.
This
is
exploited
by
the
wing
of
an
aeroplane
which
is
designed
to
create
an
area
above
its
surface
where
the
air
velocity
increases
.
The
pressure
in
this
area
is
lower
than
that
under
the
wing
,
so
the
wing
is
pushed
upwards
by
the
relatively
higher
pressure
under
the
wing
.

)
,
self-identified
as
Peter
Charles
L'Enfant
while
living
in
the
United
States
,
was
a
French-born
American
military
engineer
who
designed
the
basic
plan
for
Washington
,
D.C.
(
capital
city
of
the
U.S.
)
known
today
as
the
L'Enfant
Plan
(
1791
)
.
Early
life
and
education
L'Enfant
was
born
in
Paris
,
France
on
August
2
,
1754
,
the
third
child
and
second
son
of
Pierre
L'Enfant
(
1704
–
1787
)
,
a
painter
with
a
good
reputation
in
the
service
of
King
Louis
XV
of
France
,
(
1710
-
1774
,
reigned
1715
-
1774
)
,
and
Marie
L'Enfant
,
the
daughter
of
a
minor
official
at
court
.
In
1758
,
his
brother
Pierre
Joseph
died
at
the
age
of
six
,
and
Pierre
Charles
became
the
eldest
son
.
He
studied
art
at
the
Royal
Academy
in
the
Louvre
,
as
well
as
with
his
father
at
the
Royal
Academy
of
Painting
and
Sculpture
.
He
left
school
in
France
to
enlist
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
on
the
side
of
the
rebelling
colonials
.
Military
service
L'Enfant
was
recruited
by
Pierre
Augustin
Caron
de
Beaumarchais
to
serve
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
in
the
United
States
.
He
arrived
in
1777
at
the
age
of
23
,
and
served
as
a
military
engineer
in
the
Continental
Army
with
Major
General
Lafayette
.
He
was
commissioned
as
a
captain
in
the
Corps
of
Engineers
on
April
3
,
1779
to
rank
from
February
18
,
1778
.
Despite
his
aristocratic
origins
,
L'Enfant
closely
identified
with
the
United
States
,
changing
his
first
name
from
Pierre
to
Peter
when
he
first
came
to
the
rebelling
colonies
in
1777
.
L'Enfant
served
on
General
George
Washington
's
staff
at
Valley
Forge
.
While
there
,
the
Marquis
de
Lafayette
commissioned
L'Enfant
to
paint
a
portrait
of
Washington
.
He
was
wounded
at
the
Siege
of
Savannah
on
October
9
,
1779
.
He
recovered
and
became
a
prisoner
of
war
at
surrender
of
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
on
May
12
,
1780
.
He
was
exchanged
in
November
1780
and
served
on
General
George
Washington
's
staff
for
the
remainder
of
the
American
Revolution
.
L'Enfant
was
promoted
by
brevet
to
Major
in
the
Corps
of
Engineers
on
May
2
,
1783
,
in
recognition
of
his
service
to
the
cause
of
American
liberty
.
He
was
discharged
when
the
Continental
Army
was
disbanded
in
December
1783
.
After
the
war
,
L'Enfant
designed
the
badge
of
the
Society
of
the
Cincinnati
,
an
organization
of
former
officers
of
the
Continental
Army
,
shaped
as
an
eagle
,
at
the
request
of
Washington
.
He
was
sent
to
France
to
have
insignias
made
for
members
of
the
Society
,
a
group
of
veterans
of
the
war
.
Career
Post–Revolutionary
War
Following
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
L'Enfant
established
a
successful
and
highly
profitable
civil
engineering
firm
in
New
York
City
.
He
achieved
some
fame
as
an
architect
by
redesigning
the
City
Hall
in
New
York
for
the
First
Congress
of
the
United
States
(
See
:
Federal
Hall
)
.
He
also
designed
furniture
and
houses
for
the
wealthy
as
well
as
coins
and
medals
,
including
the
insignia
of
the
Society
of
the
Cincinnati
.
He
was
also
a
friend
of
Alexander
Hamilton
,
and
some
of
their
correspondances
from
1790
to
1801
now
reside
in
the
National
Archives
.
While
L'Enfant
was
in
New
York
City
,
he
was
initiated
into
Freemasonry
.
His
initiation
took
place
on
April
17
,
1789
,
at
Holland
Lodge
No.
8
,
F&AM
,
which
the
Grand
Lodge
of
New
York
F&AM
had
chartered
in
1787
.
L'Enfant
took
only
the
first
of
three
degrees
offered
by
the
Lodge
and
did
not
progress
further
in
Freemasonry
.
Final
days
Siméon
Poisson
reviewed
Galois
'
paper
on
equation
theory
and
declared
it
"
incomprehensible
"
.
Galois
returned
to
mathematics
after
his
expulsion
from
the
École
Normale
,
although
he
continued
to
spend
time
in
political
activities
.
After
his
expulsion
became
official
in
January
1831
,
he
attempted
to
start
a
private
class
in
advanced
algebra
which
attracted
some
interest
,
but
this
waned
,
as
it
seemed
that
his
political
activism
had
priority
.
[

]
[
7
]
Siméon
Poisson
asked
him
to
submit
his
work
on
the
theory
of
equations
,
which
he
did
on
17
January
1831
.
Around
4
July
1831
,
Poisson
declared
Galois
'
work
"
incomprehensible
"
,
declaring
that
"
[
Galois
'
]
argument
is
neither
sufficiently
clear
nor
sufficiently
developed
to
allow
us
to
judge
its
rigor
"
;
however
,
the
rejection
report
ends
on
an
encouraging
note
:
"
We
would
then
suggest
that
the
author
should
publish
the
whole
of
his
work
in
order
to
form
a
definitive
opinion
.
"
[
16
]
While
Poisson
's
report
was
made
before
Galois
'
July
14
arrest
,
it
took
until
October
to
reach
Galois
in
prison
.
It
is
unsurprising
,
in
the
light
of
his
character
and
situation
at
the
time
,
that
Galois
reacted
violently
to
the
rejection
letter
,
and
decided
to
abandon
publishing
his
papers
through
the
Academy
and
instead
publish
them
privately
through
his
friend
Auguste
Chevalier
.
Apparently
,
however
,
Galois
did
not
ignore
Poisson
's
advice
,
as
he
began
collecting
all
his
mathematical
manuscripts
while
still
in
prison
,
and
continued
polishing
his
ideas
until
his
release
on
29
April
1832
,
[
12
]
after
which
he
was
somehow
talked
into
a
duel
.
[
8
]
Galois
'
fatal
duel
took
place
on
30
May
.
[
17
]
The
true
motives
behind
the
duel
are
obscure
.
There
has
been
much
speculation
as
to
the
reasons
behind
it
.
What
is
known
is
that
five
days
before
his
death
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
Chevalier
which
clearly
alludes
to
a
broken
love
affair
.
[
7
]
Some
archival
investigation
on
the
original
letters
suggests
that
the
woman
of
romantic
interest
was
a
Mademoiselle
Stéphanie-Félicie
Poterin
du
Motel
,
[
18
]
the
daughter
of
the
physician
at
the
hostel
where
Galois
stayed
during
the
last
months
of
his
life
.
Fragments
of
letters
from
her
,
copied
by
Galois
himself
(
with
many
portions
,
such
as
her
name
,
either
obliterated
or
deliberately
omitted
)
,
are
available
.
[
19
]
The
letters
hint
that
Mlle.
du
Motel
had
confided
some
of
her
troubles
to
Galois
,
and
this
might
have
prompted
him
to
provoke
the
duel
himself
on
her
behalf
.
This
conjecture
is
also
supported
by
other
letters
Galois
later
wrote
to
his
friends
the
night
before
he
died
.
Galois
'
cousin
,
Gabriel
Demante
,
when
asked
if
he
knew
the
cause
of
the
duel
,
mentioned
that
Galois
"
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
supposed
uncle
and
a
supposed
fiancé
,
each
of
whom
provoked
the
duel
.
"
Galois
himself
famously
exclaimed
:
"
I
am
the
victim
of
an
infamous
coquette
and
her
two

Much
more
detailed
speculation
based
on
these
scant
historical
details
has
been
interpolated
by
many
of
Galois
'
biographers
(
most
notably
by
Eric
Temple
Bell
in
Men
of
Mathematics
)
,
such
as
the
frequently
repeated
speculation
that
the
entire
incident
was
stage-managed
by
the
police
and
royalist
factions
to
eliminate
a
political
enemy
.
[

As
to
his
opponent
in
the
duel
,
Alexandre
Dumas
names
Pescheux
d'Herbinville
,
[
13
]
who
was
actually
one
of
the
nineteen
artillery
officers
whose
acquittal
was
celebrated
at
the
banquet
that
occasioned
Galois
'
first
arrest
.
[
20
]
However
,
Dumas
is
alone
in
this
assertion
,
and
if
he
were
correct
it
is
unclear
why
d'Herbinville
would
have
been
involved
.
It
has
been
speculated
that
he
might
have
been
du
Motel
's
"
supposed
fiancé
"
at
the
time
(
she
ultimately
married
someone
else
)
,
but
no
clear
evidence
has
been
found
supporting
this
conjecture
.
On
the
other
hand
,
extant
newspaper
clippings
from
only
a
few
days
after
the
duel
give
a
description
of
his
opponent
(
identified
by
the
initials
"
L.
D.
"
)
that
appear
to
more
accurately
apply
to
one
of
Galois
'
Republican
friends
,
most
probably
Ernest
Duchatelet
,
who
was
imprisoned
with
Galois
on
the
same
charges
.
[
21
]
Given
the
conflicting
information
available
,
the
true
identity
of
his
killer
may
well
be
lost
to
history
.
Whatever
the
reasons
behind
the
duel
,
Galois
was
so
convinced
of
his
impending
death
that
he
stayed
up
all
night
writing
letters
to
his
Republican
friends
and
composing
what
would
become
his
mathematical
testament
,
the
famous
letter
to
Auguste
Chevalier
outlining
his
ideas
,
and
three
attached
manuscripts
.
[
22
]
Mathematician
Hermann
Weyl
said
of
this
testament
,
"
This
letter
,
if
judged
by
the
novelty
and
profundity
of
ideas
it
contains
,
is
perhaps
the
most
substantial
piece
of
writing
in
the
whole
literature
of
mankind
.
"
However
,
the
legend
of
Galois
pouring
his
mathematical
thoughts
onto
paper
the
night
before
he
died
seems
to
have
been
exaggerated
.
[

]
In
these
final
papers
,
he
outlined
the
rough
edges
of
some
work
he
had
been
doing
in
analysis
and
annotated
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
submitted
to
the
Academy
and
other
papers
.

Early
in

was

died
the
following
morning
[

at
ten
o'clock
in
the
Hôpital
Cochin
(
probably
of
peritonitis
)
,
after

funeral
ended
in
riots

[

There
were

to
initiate

uprising
during

funeral
,
but
during
the

time
frame
the
leaders
heard
of

Jean
Maximilien
Lamarque
's
death
,
and
the
rising
was
postponed
without

uprising
occurring
until

younger
brother
was
notified
of
the
events
prior
to

death

[

He
was
20
years
old
.
His
last
words
to
his

Alfred
were
:

A
bust
of
Patrick
Gordon
in
Yekaterinburg
,
Russia
Patrick
Leopold
Gordon
of
Auchleuchries
(
31
March
1635
in
Auchleuchries
,
Aberdeenshire
,
Scotland
–
29
November
1699
in
Moscow
,
Russia
)
was
a
general
and
rear
admiral
in
Russia
,
of
Scottish
origin
.
He
was
descended
from
a
family
of
Aberdeenshire
,
holders
of
the
small
estate
of
Auchleuchries
,
near
Ellon
.
The
family
was
connected
with
the
noble
branch
of
Haddo
.
As
a
result
of
his
distinguished
service
for
Sweden
,
Poland
and
Russia
he
rose
in
ranks
from
trooper
to
full
general
,
and
became
principal
advisor
and
close
friend
of
Tsar
Peter
the
Great
.
Gordon
assumed
the
additional
Christian
name
of
Leopold
when
confirmed
as
a
Roman
Catholic
shortly
before
his
death
.
Life
Gordon
was
brought
up
and
remained
a
lifelong
Roman
Catholic
,
at
a
time
when
the
Church
was
being
persecuted
in
Scotland
,
which
had
become
Calvinist
.
After
an
education
at
the
parish
schools
of
Cruden
and
Ellon
,
at
age
of
fifteen
he
entered
the
Jesuit
college
at
Braunsberg
,
East
Prussia
,
then
part
of
Poland
;
however
,
his
character
did
not
tolerate
well
the
strict
and
sombre
way
of
life
at
the
school
,
and
he
soon
decided
to
return
home
.
He
changed
his
mind
,
however
,
before
re-embarking
on
the
journey
back
to
Scotland
,
and
after
journeying
on
foot
in
several
parts
of
what
is
today
Germany
,
in
1655
he
enlisted
at
Hamburg
into
the
military
service
of
Sweden
.
In
the
course
of
the
next
five
years
he
served
alternately
for
Poland
and
Sweden
and
was
taken
prisoner
by
both
.
At
the
Battle
of
Chudnov
in
1660
,
Gordon
was
wounded
.
[
1
]
Upon
hearing
of
the
Stuart
restoration
,
Gordon
left
the
Polish
service
,
but
found
himself
unable
to
obtain
military
employment
in
Scotland
or
England
.
[
1
]
In
1661
,
after
further
experiences
as
a
soldier
of
fortune
,
he
joined
the
Russian
army
under
Tsar
Aleksei
I
,
and
in
1665
was
sent
on
a
special
mission
to
England
.
After
his
return
he
distinguished
himself
in
several
wars
against
the
Turks
and
Tatars
in
southern
Russia
.
Gordon
disliked
the
Russian
service
,
complaining
of
the
corruption
and
venality
of
Russian
officials
,
which
left
him
,
in
his
own
words
,
"
almost
at
wit
s
end
with
vexation
"
.
[
2
]
However
,
in
recognition
of
his
service
he
was
promoted
to
major-general
in
1678
,
was
appointed
to
the
high
command
at
Kiev
in
1679
,
and
in
1683
was
made
lieutenant-general
.
He
was
not
the
only
Scottish
soldier
in
the
Tsar
's
service
;
his
fellow-Scots
Paul
Menzies
and
Alexander
Livingston
also
found
themselves
in
Russia
fleeing
religious
intolerance
or
seeking
adventure
.
Gordon
visited
England
and
Scotland
in
1686
.
In
1687
and
1689
he
took
part
in
expeditions
against
the
Tatars
in
the
Crimea
,
being
made
a
full
general
.
Later
in
1689
a
revolution
broke
out
in
Moscow
,
and
with
the
troops
under
his
command
Gordon
virtually
decided
events
in
favour
of
Peter
the
Great
,
[
3
]
and
against
the
Regent
,
Tsarevna
Sophia
Alekseyevna
.
Consequently
,
he
was
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
high
favour
with
the
Tsar
,
who
confided
to
him
the
command
of
his
capital
during
his
absence
from
Russia
.
In
1696
,
Gordon
's
design
of
a
"
moveable
rampart
"
played
a
key
role
in
helping
the
Russians
take
Azov
.

Gordon
's
alleged
tomb
at
Vvedenskoye
Cemetery
in
Moscow

One
of
Gordon
's
greatest
achievements
was
securing
permission
from
the
Tsars
to
establish
the
first
Roman
Catholic
church
and
school
in
Muscovy
,
of
which
he
remained
the
main
benefactor
,
and
headed
the
Catholic
community
in
Russia
until
his
death
.
For
his
services
his
second
son
James
,
brigadier
of
the
Russian
army
,
was
created
Count
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
1701
.
The
Tsar
employed
him
in
organizing
his
army
according
to
the
West
European
system
;
and
raised
him
to
the
rank
of
full
general
.
At
the
end
of
his
life
the
Tsar
,
who
had
visited
Gordon
frequently
during
his
illness
,
was
with
him
when
he
died
,
and
with
his
own
hands
closed
his
eyes
.
Originally
buried
in
the
Foreign
Quarter
,
his
remains
were
reinterred
at
Azov
in
1877
,
with
an
inscription
in
German
which
mistakenly
gives
his
rank
as
Oberst
,
Colonel
.
General
Gordon
left
behind
him
a
uniquely
detailed
diary
of
his
life
and
times
,
written
in
English
.
This
is
preserved

Hadid
was
born
on

,
to
an
upper-class
Iraqi
family
.
Her
father
Mohammed
Hadid
Muhammad
al-Hajj
Husayn
Hadid
was
a
wealthy
industrialist
from
Mosul
.
He
co-founded
the
left-liberal
al-Ahali
group
in
1932
,
a
significant
political
organisation
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
.
He
was
the
co-founder
of
the
National
Democratic
Party
in
Iraq
.
He
served
as
minister
of
finance
after
the
overthrow
of
the
monarch
after
the
1958
Iraqi
coup
d'état
for
the
government
of
General
Abd
al-Karim
Qasim
.
Her
mother
Wajiha
al-Sabunji
was
an
artist
from
Mosul
.
In
the
1960s
Hadid
attended
boarding
schools
in
England
and
Switzerland
.
Hadid
studied
mathematics
at
the
American
University
of
Beirut
before
moving
,
in
1972
,
to
London
to
study
at
the
Architectural
Association
School
of
Architecture
.
There
she
studied
with
Rem
Koolhaas
,
Elia
Zenghelis
and
Bernard
Tschumi
.
Her
former
professor
,
Koolhaas
,
described
her
at
graduation
as
"
a
planet
in
her
own
orbit

"
Zenghelis
described
her
as
the
most
outstanding
pupil
he
ever
taught
.
Nothing
was
ever
at
90
degrees
.
She
had
spectacular
vision

He
recalled
that
she
was
less
interested
in
details
,
such
as
staircases
.
She
could
n’t
care
about
tiny
details

Her
mind
was
on
the
broader
pictures

when
it
came
to

knew

Higuchi

May
2

–
November

,

was
a
pen
name
of
Japanese
author
Natsu
Higuchi
(
樋口
奈津
Higuchi
Natsu
)
,
also
known
as
Natsuko
Higuchi
(
樋口
夏子
Higuchi
Natsuko
)
.
Specializing
in
short
stories
,
she
was
one
of
the
first
important
writers
to
appear
in
the
Meiji
period
(
1868
-
1912
)
and
Japan
's
first
prominent
woman
writer
of
modern
times
.
She
wrote
relatively
little
as
a
result
of
living
a
brief
life
—
she
died
at
24
—
but
her
stories
had
a
large
impact
on
Japanese
literature
and
she
is
still
appreciated
by
the
Japanese
public
today
.
Efforts
to
become
a
writer
She
,
her
mother
,
and
younger
sister
made
ends
meet
by
doing
needlework
,
washing
,
and
other
jobs
.
In
1892
,
after
seeing
the
success
of
a
classmate
,
Kaho
Tanabe
,
who
wrote
a
novel
,
Higuchi
decided
to
become
a
novelist
to
support
her
family
.
Nevertheless
,
her
initial
efforts
at
writing
fiction
were
in
the
form
of
a
short
story
,
a
form
to
which
she
would
remain
true
.
In
1891
she
met
her
future
advisor
who
would
help
,
she
assumed
,
this
poet-turned-fiction-writer
and
connect
her
with
editors
:
Tosui
Nakarai
.
She
fell
in
love
with
him
right
away
,
not
knowing
that
,
at
31
,
he
had
a
reputation
as
a
womanizer
.
Nor
did
she
realize
that
he
wrote
popular
literature
which
aimed
to
please
the
general
public
and
in
no
way
wished
to
be
associated
with
serious
literature
.
Her
mentor
did
not
return
her
passionate
,
if
discreet
,
love
for
him
,
and
instead
treated
her
as
a
younger
sister
.
This
failed
relationship
would
become
a
recurrent
theme
in
Higuchi
's
fiction
.
Eventually
,
she
got
the
break
she
was
so
eager
for
:
her
first
stories
were
published
in
a
minor
newspaper
under
her
pen
name
,
Ichiyo
Higuchi
.
The
stories
from
this
first
period
(
1892
–
94
)
suffered
from
the
excessive
influence
of
Heian
poetry
.
Higuchi
felt
compelled
to
demonstrate
her
classical
literary
training
.
The
plots
were
thin
,
there
was
little
development
of
character
and
they
were
loaded
down
by
excessive
sentiment
,
especially
when
compared
to
what
she
was
writing
concurrently
in
her
diary
.
But
she
was
developing
rapidly
.
Several
of
her
trademark
themes
appear
;
for
example
,
the
triangular
relationship
among
a
lonely
,
beautiful
,
young
woman
who
has
lost
her
parents
,
a
handsome
man
who
has
abandoned
her
(
and
remains
in
the
background
)
,
and
a
lonely
and
desperate
ragamuffin
who
falls
in
love
with
her
.
Another
theme
Higuchi
repeated
was
the
ambition
and
cruelty
of
the
Meiji
middle
class
.
The
story
"
Umoregi
"
(
"
In
Obscurity
"
)
signaled
Higuchi
's
arrival
as
a
professional
writer
.
It
was
published
in
the
prestigious
journal
Miyako
no
Hana
in
1892
,
only
nine
months
after
she
had
started
writing
in
earnest
.
Her
work
was
noticed
and
she
was
recognized
as
a
promising
new
author
.
Her
last
years
In
1893
,
Higuchi
,
her
mother
and
her
sister
abandoned
their
middle
class
house
and
,
with
a
grim
determination
to
survive
,
moved
to
a
poor
neighborhood
where
they
opened
a
stationery
store
that
before
long
failed
.
Their
new
dwelling
was
a
five-minute
walk
from
Tokyo
's
ill-famed
red-light
district
,
the
Yoshiwara
.
Her
experience
living
in
this
neighborhood
would
provide
material
for
several
of
her
later
stories
,
especially
"
Takekurabe
"
,
(
literally
,
"
Comparing
heights
"
;
"
Child
's
Play
"
in
the
Robert
Lyons
Danly
translation
;
also
called
"
Growing
Up
"
in
the
Edward
Seidensticker
translation
.
)
The
stories
of
her
mature
period
(
1894
–
96
)
were
not
only
marked
by
her
experience
living
near
the
red-light
district
and
greater
concern
over
the
plight
of
women
,
but
also
by
the
influence
of
Ihara
Saikaku
,
a
17th-century
writer
,
whose
stories
she
had
recently
discovered
.
His
distinctiveness
lay
in
great
part
in
his
acceptance
of
low-life
characters
as
worthwhile
literary
subjects
.
What
Higuchi
added
was
a
special
awareness
of
suffering
and
sensitivity
.
To
this
period
belong
"
Ōtsugomori
"
(
"
On
the
Last
Day
of
the
Year
"
)
,
"
Nigorie
"
(
"
Troubled
Waters
"
)
,
"
Wakare-Michi
"
(
"
Separate
Ways
"
)
,
"
Jūsan'ya
"
(
"
The
Thirteenth
Night
"
)
and
"
Takekurabe
"
(
"
Child
's
Play
"
)
.
The
last
two
are
considered
her
best
work
.
With
these
last
stories
her
fame
spread
throughout
the
Tokyo
literary
establishment
.
In
her
humble
home
she
was
visited
by
other
writers
,
students
of
poetry
,
admirers
,
the
curious
,
critics
,
and
editors
requesting
her
collaboration
.
But
between
constant
interruptions
and
frequent
headaches
,
Higuchi
stopped
writing
.
As
her
father
and
one
of
her
brothers
had
before
her
,
she
had
caught
tuberculosis
.
She
died
on
November
23
,
1896
,
at
the
age
of
twenty-four
.
Higuchi
's
likeness
adorns
the
Japanese

yen
banknote

fall

,
becoming
the
third
woman
to
appear
on
a
Japanese
banknote
,
after
Empress
Jingū
in
1881
and
Murasaki
Shikibu
in
2000

best-known
stories

Eugene
Nida
Eugene
A.
Nida
(
November
11
,
1914
–
August
25
,
2011
)
was
a
linguist
who
developed
the
dynamic-equivalence
Bible-translation
theory
and
one
of
the
founders
of
the
modern
discipline
of
Translation
Studies
.
Life
Nida
was
born
in
Oklahoma
City
,
Oklahoma
on
November
11
,
1914
.
He
became
a
Christian
at
a
young
age
,
when
he
responded
to
the
altar
call
at
his
church
"
to
accept
Christ
as
my
Saviour
.
"
He
graduated
summa
cum
laude
from
the
University
of
California
in
1936
.
After
graduating
he
attended
Camp
Wycliffe
,
where
Bible
translation
theory
was
taught
.
He
ministered
for
a
short
time
among
the
Tarahumara
Indians
in
Chihuahua
,
Mexico
,
until
health
problems
due
to
an
inadequate
diet
and
the
high
altitude
forced
him
to
leave
.
Sometime
in
this
period
,
Nida
became
a
founding
charter
member
of
Wycliffe
Bible
Translators
,
a
related
organization
to
the
Summer
Institute
of
Linguistics
.
In
1937
,
Nida
undertook
studies
at
the
University
of
Southern
California
,
where
he
obtained
a
master
's
degree
in
New
Testament
Greek
in
1939
.
In
that
same
year
he
became
interim
pastor
of
Calvary
Church
of
Santa
Ana
,
California
following
the
resignation
of
its
founding
pastor
.
Despite
his
conservative
background
,
in
later
years
Nida
became
increasingly
ecumenical
and
New
Evangelical
(
clarification
needed
)
in
his
approach
.
In
1943
,
Nida
received
his
Ph.D.
in
Linguistics
from
the
University
of
Michigan
.
He
was
ordained
as
a
Baptist
minister
.
He
married
Althea
Lucille
Sprague
,
who
died
in
1993
.
In
1997
,
he
married
María
Elena
Fernandez-Miranda
,
a
lawyer
and
diplomatic
attache
.
Nida
retired
in
the
early
1980s
,
although
he
continued
to
give
lectures
in
universities
all
around
the
world
,
and
lived
in
Alpine
,
Arizona
,
USA
;
Madrid
,
Spain
and
Brussels
,
Belgium
.
He
died
in
Madrid
on
August
25
,
2011
aged
96
.
Theories
Nida
has
been
a
pioneer
in
the
fields
of
translation
theory
and
linguistics
.
His
Ph.D.
dissertation
,
A
Synopsis
of
English
Syntax
,
was
the
first
full-scale
analysis
of
a
major
language
according
to
the
"
immediate-constituent
"
theory
.
His
textbook
Morphology
:
The
Descriptive
Analysis
of
Words
was
one
of
the
major
works
of
American
Structuralism
.
It
remained
the
only
thorough
introduction
to
the
field
for
decades
and
is
still
valuable
for
its
many
examples
and
exercises
.
His
most
notable
contribution
to
translation
theory
is
Dynamic
Equivalence
,
also
known
as
Functional
Equivalence
.
For
more
information
,
see
"
Dynamic
and
formal
equivalence
.
"
Nida
also
developed
the
componential
analysis
technique
,
which
split
words
into
their
components
to
help
determine
equivalence
in
translation
(
e.g.
"
bachelor
"
=
male
+
unmarried
)
.
This
is
,
perhaps
,
not
the
best
example
of
the
technique
,
though
it
is
the
most
well-known
.
Nida
's
dynamic-equivalence
theory
is
often
held
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
philologists
who
maintain
that
an
understanding
of
the
source
text
(
ST
)
can
be
achieved
by
assessing
the
inter-animation
of
words
on
the
page
,
and
that
meaning
is
self-contained
within
the
text
(
i.e.
much
more
focused
on
achieving
semantic
equivalence
)
.
This
theory
,
along
with
other
theories
of
correspondence
in
translating
,
are
elaborated
in
his
essay
Principles
of
Correspondence
,
where
Nida
begins
by
asserting
that
given
that
"
no
two
languages
are
identical
,
either
in
the
meanings
given
to
corresponding
symbols
or
in
the
ways
in
which
symbols
are
arranged
in
phrases
and
sentences
,
it
stands
to
reason
that
there
can
be
no
absolute
correspondence
between
languages
.
Hence
,
there
can
be
no
fully
exact
translations
.
"
While
the
impact
of
a
translation
may
be
close
to
the
original
,
there
can
be
no
identity
in
detail
.
Nida
then
sets
forth
the
differences
in
translation
,
as
he
would
account
for
it
,
within
three
basic
factors
:
The
nature
of
the
message
:
in
some
messages
the
content
is
of
primary
consideration
,
and
in
others
the
form
must
be
given
a
higher
priority
.
The
purpose
of
the
author
and
of
the
translator
:
to
give
information
on
both
form
and
content
;
to
aim
at
full
intelligibility
of
the
reader
so
he
/
she
may
understand
the
full
implications
of
the
message
;
for
imperative
purposes
that
aim
at
not
just
understanding
the
translation
but
also
at
ensuring
no
misunderstanding
of
the
translation
.
The
type
of
audience
:
prospective
audiences
differ
both
in
decoding
ability
and
in
potential
interest
.
Nida
brings
in
the
reminder
that
while
there
are
no
such
things
as
"
identical
equivalents
"
in
translating
,
what
one
must
in
translating
seek
to
do
is
find
the
"
closest
natural
equivalent
"
.
Here
he
identifies
two
basic
orientations
in
translating
based
on
two
different
types
of
equivalence
:
Formal
Equivalence
(
F-E
)
and
Dynamic
Equivalence
(
D-E
)
.
F-E
focuses
attention
on
the
message
itself
,
in
both
form
and
content
.
Such
translations
then
would
be
concerned
with
such
correspondences
as
poetry
to
poetry
,
sentence
to
sentence
,
and
concept
to
concept
.
Such
a
formal
orientation
that
typifies
this
type
of
structural
equivalence
is
called
a
"
gloss
translation
"
in
which
the
translator
aims
at
reproducing
as
literally
and
meaningfully
as
possible
the
form
and
content
of
the
original
.
The
principles
governing
an
F-E
translation
would
then
be
:
reproduction
of
grammatical
units
;
consistency
in
word
usage
;
and
meanings
in
terms
of
the
source
context
.
Theodorus
of
Tabennese
Theodorus
of
Tabennese
(
c.
314
–
368
)
,
also
known
as
Abba
Theodorus
and
Theodore
the
Sanctified
was
the
spiritual
successor
to
Pachomius
and
played
a
crucial
role
in
preventing
the
first
Christian
cenobitic
monastic
federation
from
collapsing
after
the
death
of
its
founder
.
Icon
of
St.
Theodorus
of
Tabennese
Biography
According
to
hagiography
,
Theodorus
was
born
into
a
wealthy
Christian
family
and
was
well
educated
from
a
young
age
.
Early
in
life
he
denied
the
excesses
of
his
parents
,
and
at
the
age
of
fourteen
joined
a
monastery
in
the
diocese
of
Sne
,
near
the
modern
town
of
Esna
,
Egypt
.
A
brother
from
Theodorus
’
monastery
stayed
with
Pachomius
in
Tabennese
while
traveling
and
preached
of
the
virtues
of
the
Koinonia
upon
his
return
to
Sne
.
Praying
and
weeping
,
Theodorus
became
determined
that
his
destiny
lay
with
Pachomius
.
Although
initially
denied
passage
to
Tabennese
by
a
Pachomian
monk
due
to
his
wealthy
background
,
Theodorus
opted
to
follow
the
visiting
monk
,
and
his
persistence
(
and
lack
of
obedience
)
paid
off
.
He
was
welcomed
by
Pachomius
upon
his
arrival
,
and
quickly
integrated
into
the
community
at
Tabennese
around
328
.
Quickly
becoming
a
favorite
of
Pachomius
,
Theodorus
lived
an
enviably
ascetic
life
in
the
monastery
,
and
took
on
the
title
of
the
"
brothers
’
comforter
"
.
Theodorus
asserted
his
influence
openly
(
which
resulted
in
reprimands
from
Pachomius
)
and
generally
maintained
himself
as
a
prominent
figure
at
Tabennese
for
several
years
,
despite
never
being
given
a
position
of
power
in
the
monastic
hierarchy
.
Finally
,
Pachomius
called
on
him
to
preach
to
the
brothers
despite
his
youth
,
and
eventually
appointed
him
steward
of
Tabennese
after
several
new
monasteries
had
been
built
.
Retiring
to
the
monastery
of
Phbow
,
Pachomius
gave
Theodorus
complete
control
over
Tabennese
,
though
recalled
him
from
the
position
after
witnessing
several
monks
under
Theodorus
’
watch
violating
the
monastic
rules
without
reprimand
.
Having
failed
to
prove
his
governing
ability
and
once
more
in
a
position
no
higher
than
when
he
had
entered
the
monastery
,
Theodorus
became
a
personal
assistant
to
Pachomius
and
remained
relatively
quiet
for
some
years
.
Despite
his
clear
potential
and
popularity
,
Pachomius
refused
to
grant
Theodorus
any
kind
of
authority
;
though
the
old
man
's
failing
health
soon
changed
things
forever
.
After
Theodorus
had
been
assisting
Pachomius
at
Tabennese
for
several
years
following
his
demotion
,
Pachomius
became
very
ill
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
death
.
Pachomius
had
not
named
a
successor
,
and
several
brothers
pleaded
with
Theodorus
to
assert
himself
as
head
of
the
Koinonia
when
the
sickly
man
died
.
Despite
the
assertion
that
Theodorus
apparently
did
not
want
the
rank
of
a
father
or
this
world
's
glory
,
he
consented
.
Unfortunately
for
the
would-be
leader
,
Pachomius
recovered
,
and
upon
hearing
of
Theodorus
’
decision
,
exiled
the
ambitious
young
man
.
After
living
a
life
of
constant
weeping
and
prayer
in
solitude
,
Pachomius
forgave
Theodorus
and
allowed
him
to
live
among
the
brothers
once
more
.
Normalcy
returned
,
though
never
again
would
Pachomius
fully
trust
his
former
protégé
.
In
348
Pachomius
died
,
naming
the
brother
Petronios
as
his
successor
rather
than
the
clearly
qualified
Theodorus
.
The
death
of
Petronios
later
that
year
would
leave
Apa
Horsiesios
in
charge
,
and
the
popular
Theodorus
would
retreat
to
the
distant
monastery
of
Phnoum
.
Although
it
seems
Theodorus
practiced
complete
submission
to
the
new
leader
of
the
Koinonia
,
problems
soon
arose
in
several
Pachomian
monasteries
that
viewed
Horsiesios
as
a
weak
leader
.
Refusing
to
work
or
communicate
and
demanding
a
new
leader
,
many
of
the
elder
monks
completely
abandoned
any
notion
of
obedience
to
Horsiesios
.
The
federation
of
monasteries
was
falling
apart
,
and
Theodorus
rushed
to
Tabennese
to
placate
the
rebels
.
Soon
after
his
arrival
,
Theodorus
was
the
new
de
facto
leader
,
though
he
claimed
to
be
only
acting
on
behalf
of
Horsiesios
.
For
eighteen
years
Theodorus
administered
from
Pachomius
’
old
headquarters
in
Phbow
,
using
techniques
far
more
assertive
than
his
predecessors
,
such
as
constantly
shuffling
the
offices
and
locations
of
the
most
ambitious
monks
.
Yet
in
spite
of
this
somewhat
unstable
shifting
,
the
Koinonia
was
ruled
peacefully
for
nearly
two
decades
,
at
which
point
Theodorus
predicted
he
would
soon
die
.
Within
a
few
months
his
prediction
came
true
,
and
Apa
Horsiesios
once
more
took
his
place
as
the
head
of
the
communities
in
both
title
and
authority
.

Everyone
’s
just
watching
the
weird
retarded
girl
except
this
one
chubby
guy
who
’s
trying
to
get
her
to
put
down
the
lights
but
who
’s
afraid
to
touch
her
.
“
Not

”
he
says
.
“
Where
’s

Is

”
“

”
I
say
.
The

frowns
at

“
Cara

”
I
say

“
No

”
Cara
looks
at

looks
at

I
gently

“
No

“

She
wails

lets
me
disentangle
her
hands
.
“
I
’m

”
I
say
again
,
the
concerned
big
brother
.
“
I
was
just
looking
around
and
thought
she
was
right
with
me
,
you
know
?
Our
mom
’s
down
at
Dillard
’s
.
”
Chubby
guy
kind
of
hovers
until
I
get
the
lights
away
from
Cara
and
as
soon
as
I
put
them
on
the
shelf
he
grabs
them
and
starts
straightening
them
out
and
draping
them
back
over
the
display
.
I
herd
Cara
towards
the
front
of
the
store
,
mouthing
sorry
at
the
front
cashier
.
She
’s
kind
of
pretty
.
She
smiles
at
me
.
Nice
big
brother
with
retarded
sister
.
Back
out
in
the
mall
,
Cara
is
wailing
,
which
could
start
an
asthma
attack
,
so
to
distract
her
I
say
,
“
You
want
a
cookie
?
”
Mom
has
Cara
on
a
diet
,
so
of
course
she
wants
a
cookie
.
She
perks
up
the
way
Shelby
,
our
Shetland
Sheepdog
does
,
when
you
say
‘
treat

’
I
take
her
to
the
food
court
and
buy
her
an
M&M
cookie
and
buy
myself
a
Mountain
Dew
and
then
while
she
’s
eating
her
cookie
,
I
pull
the
deck
of
cards
out
of
my
pocket
and
unwrap
it
.
We
’ve
got
another
fifteen
minutes
before
we
have
to
meet
my
mom

The
idea
is
to
play
fish
except
every
time
you
get
a
match
you
’re

do
what
it
says

Tie
partner

with
a

scarf
.
Kiss
anywhere
you

and
see
how
long
your
partner
can
keep
from
moving
or
making
any
noise
.
The
one
who
lasts
the
longest
gets
to
draw
an
extra
card
.
Tame
,
but
pretty
cool

I
ca
n’t
wait
to
show
Toph
and
Len

Cara
has
chocolate
smeared
on
her
mouth
,

she
lets
me
wipe

face
off

“
You
ready

go
back

”
I

When
we
pass
Spencer
’s
again
,
she
stops
.
“
Uhhh
,
”
she
says
,
pointing
to
the
store

Mom
always
tries
to
get
her
to
say
what
she
wants
,
but
I
know
what
she
wants
and
I
do
n’t
want
to
fight
with
her
.
“
No

”
I
say
.
“
Let
’s
go

Cara
’s
face
crumples
up
and
she
hunches
her
thick
shoulders

“
Uhhh

”
she
says
,
mad
.
“
It
’s
okay
,
”
I

.
“
Come
on

”
She
swings
at
me

I
grab

hand

pull
her
behind
me

She
tries

sit
down
,
but
I
just
keep
on
tugging
and
she
follows
me
,
gulping
and
wailing
.
“
What
did
you
do
?
”
my
mom
says
when
she
sees
us
.
My
mom
had
to
buy
stuff
,
like
gym
shorts
for
me

underwear
for
herself
,
so
I
told
her
that
I
’d
take
Cara
with
me

bought
her
stuff

She
’s
holding
a
Dillard
’s
bag

“
She

Spencer

I
say

“
We

take
her
out

’s
upset

“
Robert
,
”
my
mom
says

irritated
.
She
crouches
down
.
“
Ah
,
Cara
mia
,
do
n’t
cry

We
trail
out
of
the
store
,
Cara
holding
Mom
’s
hand
and
sniffling
.
By
the
time
we
get
to
the
car
,
though
,
Cara
’s
wheezing
.
Mom
digs
out
Cara
’s
inhaler
and
Cara
dutifully
takes
a
hit
.
I
tried
it
once
and
it
was
pretty
dreadful
.
It
felt
really
weird
,
trying
to
get
that
stuff
in
my
lungs
,
and
it
made
me
feel
a
little
buzzy
but
it
did
n’t
even
feel
good
,
so
it
’s
pretty
amazing
that
Cara
will
do
it
.
Cara
sits
in
her
booster
seat
in
the
back
of
the
car
,
wheezing
all
the
way
home
,
getting
worse
and
worse
,
and
by
the
time
we
pull
in
the
driveway
,
she
’s
got
that
white
look
around
her
mouth
.
“
Robert
,
”
Mom
says
,
“
I
’m
going
to
have
to
take
her
to
the
Emergency
Room
.
”
“
Okay
,
”
I
say
and
get
out
of
the
car
.
“
You
want
to
call
your
dad
?
”
Mom
asks
.
“
I
do
n’t
know
how
long
we
’ll
be
.
”
Mom
checks
her
watch
.
It
’s
three
something
now
.
“
We
may
not
be
home
in
time
for
dinner
.
”
I
do
n’t
want
to
call
my
dad
who
is
probably
with
Joyce
,
his
girlfriend
,
anyway
.
Joyce
is
always
trying
to
be
likable
and
it
gets
on
my
nerves
after
awhile
—
she
tries
way
too
hard
.
“
I
can
just
make
a
sandwich
,
”
I
say
.
“
I
want
you
to
stay
at
home
,
then
,
”
she
says
.
“
I
’ve
got
my
cell
phone
if
you
need
to
call
.
”
“
Can
Toph
and
Len
come
over
?
”
I
ask
.
She
sighs
.
“
Okay
.
But
no
roughhousing
.
Remember
you
have
school
tomorrow
.
”
She
opens
the
garage
door
so
I
can
get
in
.
I
stand
there
and
watch
her
back
down
the
driveway
.
She
turns
back
,
watching
where
she
’s
going
,
and
she
needs
to
get
her
hair
done
again
because
I
can
really
see
the
gray
roots
.
Cara
is
watching
me
through
the
watery
glass
,
her
mouth
a
little
open
.
I
wave
good-bye
.
I
’m
glad
they
’re
gone
.
The
day
it
rained
in
the
garden
The
first
drops
of
rain
fell
onto
the
parched
stones
from
a
cloudless
blue
sky
.
They
disappeared
immediately
,
drunk
down
into
the
mineral
silence
.
The
garden
paused
,
and
everything
held
its
breath
and
waited
.
More
rain
would
come
.
Everyone
knew
,
beyond
belief
or
necessity
that
the
time
had
come
.
And
with
it
,
the
rain
.
Heavy
oily
drops
bounced
from
leaf
to
grass
to
dusty
ground
,
gathering
in
stems
and
folds
on
the
way
.
Yet
still
the
sky
was
a
hard
polished
blue
with
not
a
cloud
in
sight
.
Still
the
garden
held
its
breath
.
It
would
not
be
long
now
.
A
spattering
of
drops
plucked
memories
from
deep
in
the
roots
,
shivering
through
shoots
and
tendrils
,
humus
and
stone
.
Wispy
vapour
trails
marbled
the
blue
surface
above
.
And
then
it
rained
for
good
.
We
sat
on
the
porch
watching
,
no
longer
daring
to
dart
out
and
leap
around
in
the
downfall
as
drops
turned
to
torrents
and
the
staccato
tapping
on
the
roof
climaxed
to
a
thunderous
roar
.
Pools
erupted
and
overflowed
along
the
edges
of
the
lawn
,
cascading
around
the
raspberry
canes
and
over
the
flower
beds
.
Earthworms
rose
up
from
the
water-laden
earth
where
they
could
no
longer
breath
and
wriggled
and
struggled
fro
air
on
the
surface
,
writhing
and
swimming
for
a
safe
haven
.
Water
burst
over
the
barrels
and
cans
standing
under
the
eaves
and
gutters
,
flooding
the
pathways
,
carrying
away
all
that
was
n’t
fixed
solid
and
licking
at
the
stairs
to
the
back
porch
before
climbing
each
step
and
lapping
against
the
planks
we
were
sitting
on
,
a
wooden
raft
surrounded
by
angry
water
and
martial
beat
drum
,
drum
,
drumming
on
the
roof
above
.
We
slipped
out
feet
over
the
sides
and
when
we
felt
the
fish
,
some
as
big
as
logs
,
some
as
small
as
leaves
,
nibble
at
our
feet
,
we
leant
over
to
watch
them
fraying
and
frolicking
under
the
choppy
surface
.
Waves
lapped
at
the
porch
,
washing
away
the
boxes
,
and
bowls
,
and
the
dog
’s
basket
.
The
rocking
chair
,
the
watering
can
,
boxes
of
cuttings
,
and
tied-up
newspapers
,
all
floated
away
as
we
slammed
the
kitchen
door
shut
and
retreated
to
the
front
room
we
gazed
out
at
the
river
that
the
street
had
become
.
The
sky
was
pewter
smeared
with
charcoal
now
,
and
pressed
down
hard
on
the
rooftops
,
slowly
dissolving
everything
below
.
When
the
water
rippled
into
the
hallway
,
we
splashed
our
way
to
the
staircase
and
then
up
as
it
nipped
at
our
heels
.
Outside
the
other
houses
were
rocks
surrounded
by
sea
with
mermaids
swimming
all
around
,
flapping
their
scaly
tails
and
hauling
themselves
up
,
to
fall
backwards
into
the
crest
of
the
oncoming
waves
.
And
as
they
swam
they
sang
,
their
voices
born
on
the
winds
and
the
salt
and
the
rain
,
and
we
could
hear
them
singing
,
He
is
coming
,
He
is
coming
.
And
they
combed
their
long
hair
in
preparation
.
We
waved
and
called
,
and
they
laughed
and
played
,
tantalising
,
their
seaweed
locks
just
out
of
reach
.
With
a
flick
of
the
tail
they
were
off
,
still
singing
,
He
is
coming
,
He
is
coming
,
until
their
voices
were
lost
in
the
noise
of
the
rain
and
the
water
.
A
great
whiskered
head
arose
,
then
a
belly
,
wet
and
sleek
,
long
enough
to
wrap
itself
twice
around
the
world
.
“
Is
it
him
?
”
we
asked
each
other
,
nudging
elbows
and
climbing
onto
the
chairs
.
We
pulled
off
wet
socks
and
shoes
,
letting
them
float
away
on
the
tide
,
before
the
great
worm
turned
and
the
wake
engulfed
the
creaking
,
cracking
house
.
We
clambered
up
onto
the
roof
,
sliding
on
the
tiles
and
clinging
to
chimney
stacks
,
sheltering
our
eyes
from
the
driving
downpour
.
The
sky
was
black
,
and
the
stormy
sea
all
the
deepest
,
darkest
blues
and
greens
and
greys
and
flecked
with
white
where
the
sea-horses
galloped
.
The
waters
broke
making
way
for
the
gnarled
head
of
a
whale
,
spouting
water
high
against
the
clouds
before
opening
its
whiskered
maw
and
in
a
looming
,
booming
voice
called
:
He
is
coming
,
He
is
coming
.
The
chimneys
washed
away
,
so
we
scrambled
onto
the
blue-black
back
encrusted
with
barnacles
and
cockles
like
stars
in
a
night
sky
and
held
on
tight
as
he
rode
the
waves
,
dipping
and
blowing
,
dipping
and
blowing
.
The
wind
and
the
rain
tugged
at
our
hair
.
And
still
it
rained
.
We
heard
a
fearsome
creaking
and
cracking
and
before
our
eyes
a
great
patch
of
sky
peeled
away
,
deeping
down
in
the
troughs
and
riding
the
crests
with
torn
sails
set
against
the
wind
.
It
was
a
galleon
with
masts
like
a
dead
man
’s
fingers
,
tarred
timbers
groaning
and
a
mermaid
sat
on
the
bow
as
he
ship
dipped
and
passed
.
He
is
coming
,
He
is
coming
,
she
sang
out
.
And
just
as
the
wash
hit
us
,
prising
us
from
the
whale
’s
speckled
back
and
down
into
the
sea
,
someone
threw
down
a
knotted
rope
and
we
hung
on
for
dear
life
.
The
singing
sailors
hauled
us
aboard
chanting
,
He
’s
a
coming
-
ha
!
He
’s
a
coming
-
ha
!
And
we
fell
onto
the
deck
like
fish
bursting
from
a
net
.
The
Captain
stood
above
us
dressed
in
jewels
and
finery
from
a
thousand
pillagings
.
The
Valley
of
Giants
I
had
buried
my
parents
in
their
gray
marble
mausoleum
at
the
heart
of
the
city
.
I
had
buried
my
husband
in
a
lead
box
sunk
into
the
mud
of
the
bottom
of
the
river
,
where
all
the
riverboatmen
lie
.
And
after
the
war
,
I
had
buried
my
children
,
all
four
,
in
white
linen
shrouds
in
the
new
graveyards
plowed
into
what
used
to
be
our
farmland
:
all
the
land
stretching
from
the
river
delta
to
the
hills
.
I
had
one
granddaughter
who
survived
the
war
.
I
saw
her
sometimes
:
in
a
bright
pink
dress
,
a
sparkling
drink
in
her
hand
,
on
the
arm
of
some
foreign
officer
with
brocade
on
his
shoulders
,
at
the
edge
of
a
marble
patio
.
She
never
looked
back
at
me
—
poverty
and
failure
and
political
disrepute
being
all
,
these
days
,
contagious
and
synonymous
.
The
young
were
mostly
dead
,
and
the
old
men
had
been
taken
away
,
they
told
us
,
to
learn
important
new
things
and
to
come
back
when
they
were
ready
to
contribute
fully
.
So
it
was
a
city
of
grandmothers
.
And
it
was
in
a
grandmother
bar
by
the
waterfront
—
sipping
hot
tea
with
rum
and
watching
over
the
shoulders
of
dockworkers
playing
mah-jongg
—
that
I
first
heard
of
the
valley
of
giants
.
We
all
laughed
at
the
idea
,
except
for
a
chemist
with
a
crooked
nose
and
rouge
caked
in
the
creases
of
her
face
,
who
was
incensed
.
“
We
live
in
the
modern
era
!
”
she
cried
.
“
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
!
"
The
traveler
stood
up
from
the
table
.
She
was
bony
and
rough-skinned
and
bent
like
an
old
crow
,
with
a
blue
silk
scarf
and
hanks
of
hair
as
black
as
soot
.
Her
eyes
were
veined
with
red
.
“
Nonetheless
,
”
the
traveler
said
,
and
she
walked
out
.
They
were
laughing
at
the
chemist
as
well
as
at
the
traveler
.
To
find
anyone
still
proud
,
anyone
who
believed
in
giants
or
shame
,
was
hilarious
.
The
air
of
the
bar
was
acrid
with
triumph
.
Finding
someone
even
more
vulnerable
and
foolish
than
we
were
,
after
everything
had
been
taken
from
us
—
that
was
a
delight
.
But
I
followed
the
traveler
,
into
the
wet
streets
.
The
smell
of
fish
oozed
from
the
docks
.
Here
and
there
were
bits
of
charred
debris
in
the
gutters
.
I
caught
her
at
her
door
.
She
invited
me
in
for
tea
and
massage
.
Her
limbs
were
weathered
and
ringed
,
like
the
branches
of
trees
in
the
dry
country
.
She
smelled
like
honey
that
has
been
kept
a
while
in
a
dark
room
,
a
little
fermented
.
A
heady
smell
.
In
the
morning
,
brilliant
sunlight
scoured
the
walls
and
the
floor
,
and
the
traveler
and
her
pack
were
gone
.
I
hurried
home
.
My
house
had
survived
the
war
with
all
its
brown
clay
walls
intact
,
though
the
garden
and
the
courtyard
were
a
heap
of
blackened
rubble
.
My
house
was
empty
and
cold
.
I
packed
six
loaves
of
flatbread
,
some
olives
,
a
hard
cheese
,
one
nice
dress
,
walking
clothes
,
my
pills
and
glasses
,
a
jug
of
wine
,
a
can-teen
of
water
,
and
a
kitchen
knife
.
I
sat
in
the
shadow
in
my
living
room
for
a
while
,
looking
at
the
amorphous
mass
of
the
blanket
I
had
been
crocheting
.
That
granddaughter
:
her
parents
both
worked
in
the
vineyards
,
and
when
she
was
a
child
,
she
would
play
in
my
courtyard
in
the
after-noons
.
When
she
scraped
her
knees
bloody
on
the
stones
,
she
refused
to
cry
.
She
would
cry
from
frustration
when
the
older
children
could
do
something
that
she
could
n't
—
like
tie
knots
,
or
catch
a
chicken
.
Oversite
“
It
does
n’t
hurt
,
Gram
,
”
Renata
says
.
My
sixteen-year-old
daughter
pulls
up
her
T-shirt
sleeve
to
show
her
bare
arm
,
the
skin
summer
brown
and
the
muscle
swelling
slightly
into
smooth
biceps
,
flawless
.
“
I
had
it
done
when
I
was
little
and
see
,
you
ca
n’t
even
tell
.
”
My
mother
is
sitting
in
the
little
examining
room
at
the
assisted
living
.
Everything
is
white
and
hospital-like
but
there
’s
no
examining
couch
.
There
’s
just
a
desk
,
a
little
white
table
with
two
chairs
and
a
scale
.
The
doctor
,
a
woman
I
do
n’t
know
,
is
sitting
in
the
other
chair
.
My
mother
is
bewildered
,
her
face
turned
up
towards
me
.
She
’s
got
Alzheimer
’s
.
“
It
’s
okay
,
Mom
,
”
I
say
.
She
wants
to
understand
,
I
can
see
that
.
So
I
explain
again
.
“
It
’s
an
implant
that
will
let
them
know
where
you
are
,
and
how
you
are
.
It
wo
n’t
hurt
.
”
Her
eyes
water
constantly
,
now
.
In
the
time
it
takes
me
to
explain
she
grasps
and
loses
the
words
,
grasps
and
loses
phrases
as
they
go
past
.
She
looks
at
me
and
then
at
Renata
,
who
is
smiling
,
and
finally
submits
uncomprehendingly
.
We
have
worn
her
down
.
The
doctor
bares
my
mother
’s
arm
,
where
the
crepey
flesh
hangs
loosely
on
the
bones
.
The
doctor
swabs
her
upper
arm
with
antiseptic
and
says
,
“
I
’m
going
to
give
you
something
to
numb
it
,
okay
?
”
To
me
the
doctor
says
in
her
normal
voice
,
“
It
’s
just
a
little
lidocaine
.
”
I
do
n’t
like
the
doctor
,
but
I
do
n’t
know
why
.
She
is
no-nonsense
.
She
has
professional
hair
,
lightly
streaked
.
This
is
no
reason
to
dislike
her
.
My
mother
winces
at
the
injection
and
is
surprised
again
.
She
looks
up
at
me
,
at
Renata
.
We
are
smiling
,
both
of
us
.
“
Okay
,
”
my
mother
says
.
What
is
okay
?
I
have
no
idea
.
We
wait
for
a
few
minutes
.
My
mother
says
,
“
Is
it
time
to
go
?
”
“
Not
yet
,
”
I
say
.
“
They
’re
going
to
give
you
an
injection
.
”
“
What
?
”
my
mother
says
.
“
They
’re
going
to
implant
a
chip
.
It
will
help
them
take
care
of
you
.
”
I
try
to
say
it
every
time
as
if
it
was
the
first
time
I
said
it
.
I
do
n’t
want
to
embarrass
her
.
Her
head
swings
around
,
from
Renata
to
me
to
the
doctor
and
then
back
to
Renata
.
“
It
’s
okay
,
Gram
,
”
Renata
says
.
“
Renata
,
”
my
mother
says
.
The
doctor
has
an
injection
gun
and
while
my
mother
is
focused
on
my
daughter
,
she
puts
it
firmly
against
my
mother
’s
arm
and
puts
the
chip
in
.
“
Oh
!
”
says
my
mother
.
It
’s
another
low-grade
moment
of
horror
,
but
I
think
about
that
particular
time
with
my
mother
because
Renata
was
there
and
we
were
united
,
she
and
I
.
So
that
’s
a
good
memory
.
I
come
back
to
it
a
lot
.
In
the
background
,
shining
,
is
Renata
,
who
is
young
and
healthy
and
good
,
raising
her
arm
to
show
her
grandmother
that
the
chip
is
nothing
,
nothing
at
all
.
The
last
two
nights
I
have
dreamed
of
dogs
in
trouble
.
I
do
n’t
dream
about
Renata
,
although
when
the
dreams
wake
me
up
,
it
’s
thinking
about
Renata
that
keeps
me
awake
.
The
first
night
I
dreamed
of
seeing
a
stray
dog
and
not
stopping
to
pick
it
up
although
it
was
wandering
in
an
empty
parking
lot
near
a
busy
road
.
That
was
the
first
night
Renata
did
n’t
come
home
and
it
does
n’t
take
Freud
to
figure
out
what
that
meant
.
Seventeen-year-olds
sleep
on
friends
’
couches
,
I
know
.
Or
Renata
might
be
sleeping
in
her
car
.
The
second
night
I
dreamed
that
I
was
on
a
desert
island
and
Sonia
,
our
golden
retriever
,
was
with
me
.
There
was
some
horrible
fate
impending
for
Sonia
and
I
had
to
kill
her
before
something
worse
happened
.
I
laid
her
down
on
some
sticks
.
She
trusts
me
,
she
’s
more
my
dog
than
anyone
’s
,
and
she
did
n’t
like
it
but
for
me
she
lay
there
.
In
my
dream
I
told
her
,
“
Stay
,
Sonia
.
Stay
.
”
She
stayed
because
I
held
her
there
by
looking
at
her
,
the
way
you
can
sometimes
will
a
dog
into
submission
.
She
stayed
while
I
lit
the
fire
.
And
then
the
horror
of
it
all
hit
me
and
I
said
,
“
Sonia
,
up
!
”
And
I
woke
up
.
That
was
last
night
,
the
second
night
Renata
did
n’t
come
home
.
Prologue
Try
to
deal
with
the
past
.
It
's
not
real
.
It
's
just
a
dream
.
"
—
Ted
Bundy
It
did
n't
start
out
here
.
Not
with
the
scramblers
or
Rorschach
,
not
with
Big
Ben
or
Theseus
or
the
vampires
.
Most
people
would
say
it
started
with
the
Fireflies
,
but
they
'd
be
wrong
.
It
ended
with
all
those
things
.
For
me
,
it
began
with
Robert
Paglino
.
At
the
age
of
eight
,
he
was
my
best
and
only
friend
.
We
were
fellow
outcasts
,
bound
by
complementary
misfortune
.
Mine
was
developmental
.
His
was
genetic
:
an
uncontrolled
genotype
that
left
him
predisposed
to
nearsightedness
,
acne
,
and
(
as
it
later
turned
out
)
a
susceptibility
to
narcotics
.
His
parents
had
never
had
him
optimized
.
Those
few
TwenCen
relics
who
still
believed
in
God
also
held
that
one
should
n't
try
to
improve
upon
His
handiwork
.
So
although
both
of
us
could
have
been
repaired
,
only
one
of
us
had
been
.
I
arrived
at
the
playground
to
find
Pag
the
center
of
attention
for
some
half-dozen
kids
,
those
lucky
few
in
front
punching
him
in
the
head
,
the
others
making
do
with
taunts
of
mongrel
and
polly
while
waiting
their
turn
.
I
watched
him
raise
his
arms
,
almost
hesitantly
,
to
ward
off
the
worst
of
the
blows
.
I
could
see
into
his
head
better
than
I
could
see
into
my
own
;
he
was
scared
that
his
attackers
might
think
those
hands
were
coming
up
to
hit
back
,
that
they
'd
read
it
as
an
act
of
defiance
and
hurt
him
even
more
.
Even
then
,
at
the
tender
age
of
eight
and
with
half
my
mind
gone
,
I
was
becoming
a
superlative
observer
.
But
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
had
n't
seen
much
of
Pag
lately
.
I
was
pretty
sure
he
'd
been
avoiding
me
.
Still
,
when
your
best
friend
's
in
trouble
you
help
out
,
right
?
Even
if
the
odds
are
impossible
—
and
how
many
eight-year-olds
would
go
up
against
six
bigger
kids
for
a
sandbox
buddy
?
—
at
least
you
call
for
backup
.
Flag
a
sentry
.
Something
.
I
just
stood
there
.
I
did
n't
even
especially
want
to
help
him
.
That
did
n't
make
sense
.
Even
if
he
had
n't
been
my
best
friend
,
I
should
at
least
have
empathized
.
I
'd
suffered
less
than
Pag
in
the
way
of
overt
violence
;
my
seizures
tended
to
keep
the
other
kids
at
a
distance
,
scared
them
even
as
they
incapacitated
me
.
Still
.
I
was
no
stranger
to
the
taunts
and
insults
,
or
the
foot
that
appears
from
nowhere
to
trip
you
up
en
route
from
A
to
B
.
I
knew
how
that
felt
.
Or
I
had
,
once
.
But
that
part
of
me
had
been
cut
out
along
with
the
bad
wiring
.
I
was
still
working
up
the
algorithms
to
get
it
back
,
still
learning
by
observation
.
Pack
animals
always
tear
apart
the
weaklings
in
their
midst
.
Every
child
knows
that
much
instinctively
.
Maybe
I
should
just
let
that
process
unfold
,
maybe
I
should
n't
try
to
mess
with
nature
.
Then
again
,
Pag
's
parents
had
n't
messed
with
nature
,
and
look
what
it
got
them
:
a
son
curled
up
in
the
dirt
while
a
bunch
of
engineered
superboys
kicked
in
his
ribs
.
In
the
end
,
propaganda
worked
where
empathy
failed
.
Back
then
I
did
n't
so
much
think
as
observe
,
did
n't
deduce
so
much
as
remember
—
and
what
I
remembered
was
a
thousand
inspirational
stories
lauding
anyone
who
ever
stuck
up
for
the
underdog
.
So
I
picked
up
a
rock
the
size
of
my
fist
and
hit
two
of
Pag
's
assailants
across
the
backs
of
their
heads
before
anyone
even
knew
I
was
in
the
game
.
A
third
,
turning
to
face
the
new
threat
,
took
a
blow
to
the
face
that
audibly
crunched
the
bones
of
his
cheek
.
I
remember
wondering
why
I
did
n't
take
any
satisfaction
from
that
sound
,
why
it
meant
nothing
beyond
the
fact
I
had
one
less
opponent
to
worry
about
.
The
rest
of
them
ran
at
the
sight
of
blood
.
One
of
the
braver
promised
me
I
was
dead
,
shouted
"
Fucking
zombie
!
"
over
his
shoulder
as
he
disappeared
around
the
corner
.
Three
decades
it
took
,
to
see
the
irony
in
that
remark
.
Two
of
the
enemy
twitched
at
my
feet
.
I
kicked
one
in
the
head
until
it
stopped
moving
,
turned
to
the
other
.
Something
grabbed
my
arm
and
I
swung
without
thinking
,
without
looking
until
Pag
yelped
and
ducked
out
of
reach
.
Oh
,
I
said
.
Sorry
.
One
thing
lay
motionless
.
The
other
moaned
and
held
its
head
and
curled
up
in
a
ball
.
Oh
shit
,
Pag
panted
.
Blood
coursed
unheeded
from
his
nose
and
splattered
down
his
shirt
.
His
cheek
was
turning
blue
and
yellow
.
Oh
shit
oh
shit
oh
shit
...
I
thought
of
something
to
say
.
You
all
right
?
Oh
shit
,
you
—
I
mean
,
you
never
...
He
wiped
his
mouth
.
Blood
smeared
the
back
of
his
hand
.
Oh
man
are
we
in
trouble
.
They
started
it
.
Yeah
,
but
you
—
I
mean
,
look
at
them
!
The
moaning
thing
was
crawling
away
on
all
fours
.
I
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
it
found
reinforcements
.
I
wondered
if
I
should
kill
it
before
then
.
You
'd
a
never
done
that
before
,
Pag
said
.
Before
the
operation
,
he
meant
.
I
actually
did
feel
something
then
—
faint
,
distant
,
but
unmistakable
.
I
felt
angry
.
They
started
—
Pag
backed
away
,
eyes
wide
.
Put
that
down
!
"
I
'd
raised
my
fists
.
I
did
n't
remember
doing
that
.
I
unclenched
them
.
It
took
a
while
.
I
had
to
look
at
my
hands
very
hard
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
The
rock
dropped
to
the
ground
,
blood-slick
and
glistening
.
I
was
trying
to
help
.
I
did
n't
understand
why
he
could
n't
see
that
.
You
're
,
you
're
not
the
same
,
Pag
said
from
a
safe
distance
.
You
're
not
even
Siri
any
more
.
Do
n't
be
a
fuckwad
.
"
They
cut
out
your
brain
!
For
the
ep
—
"
You
think
I
do
n't
know
?
But
you
were
in
that
half
—
or
,
like
,
part
of
you
was
...
"
He
struggled
with
the
words
,
with
the
concept
behind
them
.
It
's
like
,
your
mom
and
dad
murdered
you
—
"
My
mom
and
dad
,
I
said
,
suddenly
quiet
,
"
saved
my
life
.
I
would
have
died
.
"
I
think
you
did
die
,
said
my
best
and
only
friend
.
You
're
not
the
same
.
Ever
since
.
You
're
not
the
same
.

Daisy
by
Andrew
Willett
It
was
Sunday
in
snowy
Manhattan
.
Jenna
was
in
the
tub
,
and
I
was
doing
the
Times
crossword
,
listening
to
the
clang
of
the
radiators
and
the
swish
of
the
taxis
on
the
slush
outside
,
when
my
coffee-scented
reverie
was
broken
by
a
loud
squawk
from
the
bathroom
,
and
a
splash
,
and
a
flesh-upon-cold-tile
sort
of
thump
.
“
Go
away
!
Shoo
!
Get
out
of
my
bathroom
!
”
I
threw
down
my
pen
and
dashed
down
the
hall
.
Jenna
was
picking
herself
up
off
the
floor
of
the
bathroom
.
In
the
bathtub
,
a
bar
of
soap
was
gaily
chasing
a
nylon
scrubby
thing
around
the
surface
of
the
water
.
“
Damned
pixies
!
”
Jenna
said
,
smacking
the
bathtub
’s
drain
lever
.
“
Again
!
I
am
so
tired
of
these
things
!
”
A
piteous
squeak
came
from
the
scrubby
thing
as
the
water
began
to
swirl
down
the
drain
.
A
translucent
little
head
poked
out
from
behind
a
pot
of
organic-sugarcane
exfoliating
body
polish
,
and
looked
at
me
with
exaggerated
puppy
eyes
and
a
trembling
lower
lip
.
“
Sorry
,
kids
,
”
I
said
to
the
bathtub
.
“
Do
n’t
humor
them
,
dammit
,
”
Jenna
said
,
and
stomped
,
still
naked
,
still
wet
,
toward
the
phone
in
the
kitchen
.
She
’d
be
irritated
by
her
own
wet
footprints
on
the
battered
wood
of
the
hallway
floor
later
,
but
right
now
she
had
blood
on
her
mind
.
Or
water
.
Ichor
.
Whatever
it
is
that
the
common
Manhattan
water-pixie
uses
for
blood
.
I
could
n’t
say
I
blamed
her
.
She
got
the
brunt
of
the
pixies
’
odd
sense
of
humor
much
more
than
I
did
,
because
she
’s
the
one
who
likes
to
take
baths
.
Although
I
will
say
that
a
pixie
hiding
in
the
sink
among
the
dirty
soup
bowls
makes
doing
the
dishes
an
adventure
.
“
Ramon
?
Hi
.
It
’s
Jenna
McMasters
in
5C
.
Ramon
,
the
pixies
are
out
of
control
.
You
’ve
got
to
do
something
about
—
yes
,
I
know
—
Ramon
,
the
equinox
is
n’t
for
weeks
and
weeks
.
Really
,
we
need
you
to
do
something
sooner
...
Well
,
I
’m
just
not
ready
to
wait
that
long
.
We
may
have
to
try
something
on
our
own
,
then
.
Goodbye
,
Ramon
.
You
’ve
been
a
huge
goddamn
help
.
”
She
hung
up
the
phone
.
“
Man
,
he
’s
useless
,
”
she
said
.
“
On
the
other
hand
,
”
I
said
,
“
he
’s
the
first
super
we
’ve
had
who
keeps
the
boiler
,
the
door
buzzers
,
and
the
electrical
system
in
perfect
working
order
.
”
I
took
the
robe
I
’d
brought
from
the
bathroom
and
wrapped
it
around
her
shoulders
.
“
What
is
it
they
say
in
yoga
class
?
Take
a
deep
cleansing
breath
.
Spiral
out
from
your
navel
center
,
and
stuff
.
”
“
Robert
,
this
sort
of
thing
never
happened
in
San
Francisco
.
”
“
No
,
”
I
said
.
“
In
San
Francisco
we
got
earthquakes
,
and
there
were
wood
sprites
in
Golden
Gate
Park
.
Welcome
to
New
York
.
”
“
I
keep
trying
to
tell
myself
that
this
is
cool
.
But
then
they
come
at
me
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
have
no
work
to
do
and
I
’m
trying
to
relax
and
I
’m
naked
,
and
I
just
lose
it
...
.
”
“
And
you
take
it
out
on
the
super
,
”
I
said
.
“
And
now
I
’m
gon
na
have
a
bruise
on
my
butt
,
too
,
”
she
said
.
“
Well
,
that
’s
karma
for
you
.
Now
stretch
out
on
the
couch
,
and
I
’ll
bring
you
coffee
and
rub
your
feet
.
”
Jenna
smiled
.
“
Just
make
sure
there
are
no
pixies
in
the
coffee
pot
,
is
all
I
ask
.
”
Ugh
.
That
was
our
previous
Sunday
morning
adventure
:
most
unpleasant
,
and
marked
by
the
death
of
a
new
French-press
pot
.
I
realized
that
I
,
too
,
hated
the
pixies
.
“
We
need
a
plan
,
”
I
said
.
Stranger
Things
Happen
-
Water
Off
a
Black
Dog
’s
Back
Rachel
Rook
took
Carroll
home
to
meet
her
parents
two
months
after
she
first
slept
with
him
.
For
a
generous
girl
,
a
girl
who
took
off
her
clothes
with
abandon
,
she
was
remarkably
close-mouthed
about
some
things
.
In
two
months
Carroll
had
learned
that
her
parents
lived
on
a
farm
several
miles
outside
of
town
;
that
they
sold
strawberries
in
summer
,
and
Christmas
trees
in
the
winter
.
He
knew
that
they
never
left
the
farm
;
instead
,
the
world
came
to
them
in
the
shape
of
weekend
picnickers
and
driveby
tourists
.
Do
you
think
your
parents
will
like
me
?
"
he
said
.
He
had
spent
the
afternoon
preparing
for
this
visit
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
preparing
for
an
exam
.
He
had
gotten
his
hair
cut
,
trimmed
his
nails
,
washed
his
neck
and
behind
his
ears
.
The
outfit
he
had
chosen
,
khaki
pants
and
a
blue
button-down
shirt
--
no
tie
--
lay
neatly
folded
on
the
bed
.
He
stood
before
Rachel
in
his
plain
white
underwear
and
white
socks
,
gazing
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
mirror
.
No
,
she
said
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
to
his
apartment
,
and
she
stood
square
in
the
center
of
his
bedroom
,
her
arms
folded
against
her
body
as
if
she
was
afraid
to
sit
down
,
to
touch
something
.
Why
?
My
father
will
like
you
,
she
said
.
My
mother
's
more
particular
--
she
thinks
that
you
lack
a
serious
nature
.
"
Carroll
put
on
his
pants
,
admiring
the
crease
.
So
you
've
talked
to
her
about
me
.
Yes
.
But
you
have
n't
talked
about
her
to
me
.
No
.
Are
you
ashamed
of
her
?
Rachel
snorted
.
Then
she
sighed
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
suggest
she
was
regretting
her
decision
to
take
him
home
.
You
're
ashamed
of
me
,
he
guessed
,
and
Rachel
kissed
him
and
smiled
and
did
n't
say
anything
.
Rachel
still
lived
on
her
parents
'
farm
,
which
made
it
all
the
more
remarkable
that
she
had
kept
Carroll
and
her
parents
apart
for
so
long
.
It
suggested
a
talent
for
daily
organization
that
filled
Carroll
's
heart
with
admiration
and
lust
.
She
was
nineteen
,
two
years
younger
than
Carroll
;
she
was
a
student
at
Jellicoh
College
and
every
weekday
she
rose
at
seven
and
biked
four
miles
into
town
,
and
then
back
again
on
her
bike
,
four
miles
uphill
to
the
farm
.
Carroll
met
Rachel
in
the
Jellicoh
College
library
,
where
he
had
a
part-time
job
.
He
sat
at
the
checkout
desk
,
stamping
books
and
reading
Tristram
Shandy
for
a
graduate
class
;
he
was
almost
asleep
when
someone
said
,
"
Excuse
me
.
"
He
looked
up
.
The
girl
who
stood
before
the
tall
desk
was
red-headed
.
Sunlight
streaming
in
through
a
high
window
opposite
her
lit
up
the
fine
hairs
on
her
arm
,
the
embroidered
flowers
on
the
collar
of
her
white
shirt
.
The
sunlight
turned
her
hair
to
fire
and
Carroll
found
it
difficult
to
look
directly
at
her
.
Can
I
help
you
?
he
said
.
She
placed
a
shredded
rectangle
on
the
desk
,
and
Carroll
picked
it
up
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
.
Pages
hung
in
tatters
from
the
sodden
blue
spine
.
Title
,
binding
,
and
covers
had
been
gnawed
away
.
I
need
to
pay
for
a
damaged
book
,
she
said
.
What
happened
?
Did
your
dog
eat
it
?
he
said
,
making
a
joke
.
Yes
,
she
said
,
and
smiled
.
What
's
your
name
?
Carroll
said
.
Already
,
he
thought
he
might
be
in
love
.
Does
n’t
it
make
you
just
want
to
sneeze
?
Pete
was
leaning
against
the
wall
,
watching
the
street
go
by
.
I
pulled
the
bike
to
a
halt
,
the
front
wheel
pointing
in
his
direction
.
“
I
think
I
’ve
got
a
fairy
stuck
up
my
nose
.
”
“
S’
not
true
!
”
came
a
voice
from
inside
the
nose
in
question
.
“
Hey
!
Not
bad
that
!
”
Pete
said
.
“
I
did
n’t
see
your
lips
move
at
all
.
”
“
It
’s
not
a
joke
.
”
The
itching
was
getting
worse
.
I
pulled
out
a
paper
tissue
.
“
Stop
that
now
!
”
came
the
voice
again
.
“
You
know
I
do
n’t
like
it
.
”
“
S’
not
my
fault
.
You
make
me
want
to
sneeze
!
”
And
I
did
.
I
inspected
the
crumpled
paper
.
Lots
of
yellow
goo
,
but
no
fairy
.
Pete
looked
at
me
with
mild
disgust
as
I
eyed
the
handkerchief
more
closely
.
“
You
know
that
’s
pretty
gross
…
”
he
said
.
“
Got
any
other
brilliant
remarks
?
”
I
said
.
I
held
a
finger
up
to
my
lips
,
and
waved
a
hand
to
silence
Pete
’s
reply
.
“
Are
you
still
there
?
”
I
called
.
“
No
thanks
to
you
!
”
came
the
little
voice
.
Pete
looked
at
me
sort
of
sideways
.
“
Look
,
the
first
time
was
OK
,
but
—
”
“
It
’s
not
a
joke
.
I
’ve
really
got
something
stuck
up
there
.
I
was
riding
on
me
bike
and
I
thought
I
’d
swallowed
an
insect
or
something
.
And
then
it
started
insulting
me
.
”
“
You
’re
having
me
on
,
right
?
”
“
Pete
!
Look
at
me
.
If
it
’s
a
trick
,
how
do
I
do
it
then
?
”
Pete
thought
for
a
moment
.
“
If
it
’s
real
…
Are
n’t
they
supposed
to
have
a
pot
of
gold
or
something
?
And
they
have
to
tell
you
where
it
is
if
you
catch
them
?
”
“
That
’s
leprechauns
,
idiot
!
”
said
the
voice
from
my
noise
.
“
So
what
’s
the
difference
?
Just
give
us
the
gold
and
we
’ll
let
you
go
…
”
“
We
—
?
”
I
started
.
He
winked
at
me
.
“
Oh
,
I
’m
happy
to
stick
around
,
”
came
the
voice
.
“
It
’s
noggins
here
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
…
”
Suddenly
I
felt
a
violent
pain
in
my
nose
,
my
eyes
watered
.
“
Owwww
!
”
I
howled
.
“
See
what
I
mean
?
”
the
voice
shouted
over
my
moans
.
“
Perhaps
you
can
use
it
in
exams
…
”
Pete
said
,
scratching
his
head
.
“
You
know
,
it
could
tell
us
all
the
answers
.
”
“
Idiot
!
If
it
yacks
on
like
that
in
an
exam
,
I
’ll
get
thrown
out
.
And
probably
locked
up
too
.
”
“
Ca
n’t
it
whisper
?
”
“
Perhaps
I
do
n’t
know
the
answers
anyway
?
”
said
the
voice
.
“
Have
you
thought
of
that
?
”
“
Anyway
,
I
do
n’t
want
it
in
exams
.
I
just
want
it
to
go
.
Out
of
my
nose
.
”
“
Ca
n’t
you
just
poke
it
out
?
”
“
With
what
?
”
“
S’pose
you
’ve
already
tried
your
finger
…
”
“
Yes
he
has
,
”
the
voice
said
.
“
And
it
was
n’t
pleasant
I
can
tell
you
.
”
“
You
see
what
it
’s
like
.
He
’s
already
making
sarcastic
remarks
like
that
…
”
“
What
if
we
put
something
in
your
nose
to
catch
it
,
then
?
I
do
n’t
know
…
A
spider
?
”
“
No
!
”
we
both
said
at
once
.
“
Snap
!
”
Pete
said
.
“
You
both
said
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
,
you
’ve
got
to
make
a
—
”
He
hit
his
forehead
with
his
palm
.
“
That
’s
it
!
Three
wishes
!
When
you
catch
a
fairy
,
you
get
three
wishes
.
Hey
you
in
there
!
Is
that
right
?
”
“
You
could
see
things
like
that
…
”
said
the
voice
with
resignation
.
“
I
wish
you
’d
get
out
of
my
nose
,
then
!
”
I
cried
.
In
a
flash
the
fairy
was
out
of
my
nose
and
gone
.
And
I
’m
still
waiting
for
my
two
other
wishes
.
THE
END
Something
a
little
lighter
this
week
,
I
hope
you
enjoy
it
.
Once
it
got
started
,
I
realised
that
the
idea
must
have
been
inspired
by
the
title
of
Justine
Larbalestier
’s
How
to
Ditch
Your
Fairy
,
although
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
that
story
at
all
.
All
in
all
,
my
story
feels
very
light
.
But
I
think
I
needed
something
a
little
less
dark
,
and
there
are
some
quite
sombre
tales
coming
up
in
the
coming
weeks
.
See
you
then
.
The
Cost
to
Be
Wise
Veronique
stayed
with
me
that
night
,
lying
next
to
me
in
my
blankets
and
furs
.
She
did
n't
sleep
,
I
do
n't
think
.
I
was
listening
to
her
breath
.
I
felt
as
if
I
should
help
her
sleep
.
I
lay
there
and
tried
to
think
if
I
should
put
my
arm
around
her
,
but
I
did
n't
know
.
Maybe
she
did
n't
want
to
be
touched
.
And
she
had
been
a
stupid
girl
,
anyway
.
She
lay
tense
in
the
dark
.
Are
you
going
to
be
a
teacher
?
I
asked
.
She
laughed
.
If
I
get
out
of
here
.
I
waited
for
her
to
say
more
,
but
she
did
n't
.
Get
out
of
here
meant
to
make
someone
leave
.
Maybe
she
meant
if
she
made
herself
.
You
come
here
from
Earth
?
I
asked
.
To
get
her
to
talk
,
although
I
was
tired
of
lingua
and
I
did
n't
really
want
to
think
about
anything
.
My
family
came
here
from
Earth
,
she
said
.
Why
?
My
father
,
he
's
an
anthropologist
,
she
said
.
Do
you
know
anthropologist
?
No
,
I
said
.
And
he
is
a
teacher
.
"
All
the
offworlders
I
had
ever
met
were
teachers
.
I
wondered
who
did
all
the
work
on
Earth
.
Because
Earth
had
lost
touch
with
your
world
,
the
people
here
are
very
interesting
to
my
father
,
she
said
.
Her
voice
was
listless
in
the
dark
and
she
was
even
harder
to
understand
when
I
could
n't
see
her
properly
.
I
did
n't
understand
so
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
I
was
sorry
I
'd
started
her
talking
.
History
,
do
you
know
the
word
'
history
'
?
she
asked
.
Of
course
I
knew
the
word
"
history
.
"
I
study
history
in
school
,
I
said
.
Anneal
and
Kumar
taught
it
.
Do
you
know
the
history
of
this
world
?
It
took
my
tired
head
a
long
time
to
sort
that
out
.
Yes
,
I
said
.
People
from
Earth
come
here
to
live
.
Then
there
is
a
big
problem
on
Earth
,
and
the
people
of
Earth
forget
we
are
here
.
We
forget
we
are
from
Earth
.
Then
Earth
finds
us
again
.
"
Some
people
have
stories
about
coming
from
the
Earth
,
Veronique
said
.
I
'm
a
graduate
student
.
"
The
clans
did
n't
have
any
stories
about
coming
from
Earth
.
We
said
the
first
people
came
out
of
the
sun
.
This
somehow
seemed
embarrassing
.
I
did
n't
understand
what
kind
of
student
she
was
.
Are
you
here
for
stories
?
I
asked
.
No
,
she
said
.
We
just
came
to
visit
.
"
I
did
n't
understand
what
she
'd
said
except
that
they
were
visiting
.
We
were
quiet
after
that
.
I
pretended
to
sleep
.
Sometimes
there
was
gunfire
outside
and
we
jumped
,
even
Mam
on
the
bed
.
Everyone
but
Bet
.
Once
Bet
was
asleep
it
was
impossible
to
wake
her
up
.
I
fell
asleep
thinking
about
how
I
wished
that
the
Scathalos
outrunners
were
gone
.
I
dreamed
that
I
was
at
the
offworlder
's
home
,
where
it
was
summer
but
no
one
was
taking
care
of
the
stabros
,
and
they
were
all
glad
,
and
so
I
was
a
hero
-
and
I
was
startled
awake
by
gunfire
.
Just
more
drinking
and
shooting
.
I
wished
my
da
would
come
home
.
It
did
n't
seem
fair
that
we
should
lie
here
and
be
afraid
while
the
men
were
getting
drunk
and
singing
.
The
Chemical
Wedding
by
Christian
Rosencreutz
A
ROMANCE
IN
EIGHT
DAYS
by
JOHANN
VALENTIN
ANDREAE
in
a
new
version
by
JOHN
CROWLEY
illustrated
by
THEO
FADEL
SMALL
BEER
PRESS

.
Introduction
I
The
Chemical
Wedding
by
Christian
Rosencreutz
is
the
way
I
’ve
decided
to
present
the
title
of
this
book
.
Most
versions
in
English
are
called
The
Chemical
Wedding
of
Christian
Rosencreutz
,
which
suggests
(
and
most
people
who
’ve
heard
of
it
suppose
)
that
the
wedding
is
Christian
’s
.
It
’s
not
;
Christian
Rosencreutz
is
the
purported
author
of
a
book
called
The
Chemical
Wedding
.
The
actual
author
is
Johann
Valentin
Andreae
,
whose
name
did
n’t
appear
on
the
book
originally
,
thus
ensuring
the
confusion
.
I
’ll
call
it
herein
(
as
everyone
mostly
does
)
simply
The
Chemical
Wedding
.
Though
its
original
readers
would
have
had
a
certain
amount
of
context
for
the
truly
bizarre
and
surprising
events
it
tells
of
,
it
’s
possible
that
The
Chemical
Wedding
is
now
more
enjoyable
without
knowing
that
context
,
and
experiencing
the
book
unmediated
.
You
might
therefore
wish
to
start
right
in
on
the
first
page
of
text
that
follows
and
only
then
return
to
this
introduction
.
Consider
a
similar
case
:
a
little
book
published
in
1934
by
the
Surrealist
artist
Max
Ernst
called
Une
Semaine
de
Bonté
.
It
was
made
entirely
of
collaged
illustrations
cut
out
of
old
books
The
First
Day
It
was
just
before
Easter
Sunday
,
1
and
I
was
sitting
at
my
table
.
I
’d
said
my
prayers
,
talking
a
long
time
as
usual
with
my
Maker
and
thinking
about
some
of
the
great
mysteries
the
Father
of
Lights
had
revealed
to
me
.
Now
I
was
ready
to
make
and
to
bake
–
only
in
my
heart
,
actually
–
a
small
,
perfect
unleavened
wafer
to
eat
with
my
beloved
Paschal
Lamb
.
All
of
a
sudden
a
terrible
wind
blew
up
,
so
strong
that
I
thought
the
hill
my
little
house
was
built
on
would
be
blown
apart
–
but
I
’d
seen
the
Devil
do
things
as
bad
as
this
before
(
the
Devil
had
often
tried
to
harm
me
)
,
so
I
took
heart
and
went
on
meditating
.
Till
I
felt
somebody
touch
me
on
the
back
.
This
frightened
me
so
that
I
did
n’t
dare
turn
.
I
tried
to
stay
as
brave
and
calm
as
a
human
being
could
under
the
circumstances
.
I
felt
my
coat
tugged
at
,
and
tugged
again
,
and
at
last
I
looked
around
.
A
woman
stood
there
,
so
bright
and
beautiful
,
in
a
sky-colored
robe
–
a
heavens
covered
with
1
Christian
’s
story
begins
just
before
Easter
,
like
Dante
’s
Divine
Comedy
.
It
can
be
seen
as
an
allegory
of
Christ
’s
death
and
resurrection
,
though
this
idea
produces
some
puzzles
.
The
birds
sang
so
beautifully
,
the
young
deer
skipped
so
happily
,
that
it
gladdened
my
old
heart
,
and
I
could
n't
help
singing
too
...
THE
FOURTH
DAY
I
was
awake
and
lying
in
bed
next
morning
,
looking
idly
at
the
wonderful
images
and
inscriptions
all
around
my
room
,
when
suddenly
I
heard
the
sound
of
trumpets
,
as
if
a
procession
were
already
underway
.
My
page
jumped
out
of
bed
as
if
crazed
,
looking
more
dead
than
alive
,
and
you
can
imagine
how
I
felt
when
he
cried
,
“
They
're
already
being
presented
to
the
king
!
"
I
could
only
groan
in
frustration
and
curse
my
lazy
bones
.
I
got
dressed
,
but
my
page
was
quicker
than
I
was
and
ran
out
of
the
chamber
to
see
what
was
what
.
He
soon
came
back
and
gave
me
the
good
news
that
I
actually
had
n’t
overslept
;
all
I
’d
done
was
miss
breakfast
:
they
had
n’t
wanted
to
wake
an
old
man
who
needed
his
rest
.
But
now
I
had
to
get
ready
to
go
with
him
to
the
lion
fountain
,
where
most
of
the
others
were
gathered
.
Such
a
relief
!
My
spirits
recovered
,
and
as
soon
as
I
had
got
into
my
habit
,
I
followed
him
to
the
garden
I
have
already
told
about
.
I
found
that
the
lion
,
in
place

Nick
Bos
,
of
the
University
of
Helsinki
,
studies
"
the
amazing
adaptations
social
insects
have
evolved
in
order
to
fight
the
extreme
parasite
pressure
they
experience
"
.
In
a
recently-accepted
Evolution
paper
Bos
and
colleagues
describe
ants
appearing
to
self-medicate
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
as
time
goes
on
,
there
will
be
more
and
more
cases
documented
The
team
used
Formica
fusca
,
an
ant
species
that
can
form
thousand-strong
colonies
.
This
common
black
ant
eats
other
insects
,
and
also
aphid
honeydew
.
It
often
nests
in
tree
stumps
or
under
rocks
and
foraging
workers
can
sometimes
be
spotted
climbing
trees
.
Some
ants
were
infected
with
Beauveria
bassiana
,
a
fungus
.
Infected
ants
chose
food
laced
with
toxic
hydrogen
peroxide
,
whereas
healthy
ants
avoided
it
.
Hydrogen
peroxide
reduced
infected
ant
fatalities
by
15
%
,
and
the
ants
varied
their
intake
depending
upon
how
high
the
peroxide
concentration
was
.
In
the
wild
,
Formica
fusca
can
encounter
similar
chemicals
in
aphids
and
dead
ants
.
The
Independent
reported
self-medicating
ants
a
first
among
insects
.
Bos
obtained
his
doctorate
from
the
University
of
Copenhagen
.
He
began
postdoctoral
research
at
Helsinki
in
2012
.
He
also
runs
the
AntyScience
blog
.
The
blog
aims
to
help
address
"
a
gap
between
scientists
and
'
the
general
public
'
.
"
The
name
is
a
pun
referencing
ants
,
its
primary
topic
,
science
,
and
"
non-scientific
"
jargon-free
communication
.
He
now
discusses
his
work
with
Wikinews

What
first
attracted
you
to
researching
ants
?
Me
and
a
studymate
were
keeping
a
lot
of
animals
during
our
studies
,
from
beetles
,
to
butterflies
and
mantids
,
to
ants
.
We
had
the
ants
in
an
observation
nest
,
and
I
could
just
look
at
them
for
hours
,
watching
them
go
about
.
This
was
in
my
third
year
of
Biology
study
I
think
.
After
a
while
I
needed
to
start
thinking
about
an
internship
for
my
M.Sc.
studies
,
and
decided
to
write
a
couple
of
professors
.
I
ended
up
going
to
the
Centre
for
Social
Evolution
at
the
University
of
Copenhagen
where
I
did
a
project
on
learning
in
Ants
under
supervision
of
Prof.
Patrizia
d'Ettorre
.
I
liked
it
so
much
there
I
ended
up
doing
a
PhD
and
I
've
been
working
on
social
insects
ever
since
.
What
methods
and
equipment
were
used
for
this
investigation
?
This
is
a
fun
one
.
I
try
to
work
on
a
very
low
budget
,
and
like
to
build
most
of
the
experimental
setups
myself
(
we
actually
have
equipment
in
the
lab
nicknamed
the
'
Nickinator
'
,
'
i-Nick
'
and
the
'
Nicktendo64
'
)
.
There
's
not
that
much
money
in
fundamental
science
at
the
moment
,
so
I
try
to
cut
the
costs
wherever
possible
.
We
collected
wild
colonies
of
Formica
fusca
by
searching
through
old
tree-trunks
in
old
logging
sites
in
southern
Finland
.
We
then
housed
the
ants
in
nests
I
made
using
Y-tong
[
aerated
concrete
]
.
It
's
very
soft
stone
that
you
can
easily
carve
.
We
carved
out
little
squares
for
the
ants
to
live
in
(
covered
with
old
CD
covers
to
prevent
them
escaping
!
)
.
We
then
drilled
a
tunnel
to
a
pot
(
the
foraging
arena
)
,
where
the
ants
got
the
choice
between
the
food
with
medicine
and
the
food
without
.
We
infected
the
ants
by
preparing
a
solution
of
the
fungus
Beauveria
bassiana
.
Afterwards
,
each
ant
was
dipped
in
the
solution
for
a
couple
of
seconds
,
dried
on
a
cloth
and
put
in
the
nest
.
After
exposing
the
ants
to
the
fungus
,
we
took
pictures
of
each
foraging
arena
three
times
per
day
,
and
counted
how
many
ants
were
present
on
each
food-source
.
Example
of
aerated
concrete
,
which
provided
a
home
for
the
subjects
.

:
Marco
Bernardini
.
This
gave
us
the
data
that
ants
choose
more
medicine
after
they
have
been
infected
.
The
result
that
healthy
ants
die
sooner
when
ingesting
ROS
[
Reactive
Oxygen
Species
,
the
group
of
chemicals
that
includes
hydrogen
peroxide
]
but
infected
ants
die
less
was
obtained
in
another
way
(
as
you
have
to
'
force
feed
'
the
ROS
,
as
healthy
ants
,
when
given
the
choice
,
ignore
that
food-source
.
)
For
this
we
basically
put
colonies
on
a
diet
of
either
food
with
medicine
or
without
for
a
while
.
And
afterwards
either
infected
them
or
not
.
Then
for
about
two
weeks
we
count
every
day
how
many
ants
died
.
This
gives
us
the
data
to
do
a
so-called
survival
analysis
.
We
measured
the
ROS-concentration
in
the
bodies
of
ants
after
they
ingested
the
food
with
the
medicine
using
a
spectrophotometer
.
By
adding
certain
chemicals
,
the
ROS
can
be
measured
using
the
emission
of
light
of
a
certain
wave-length
.
The
detrimental
effect
of
ROS
on
spores
was
easy
to
measure
.
We
mixed
different
concentrations
of
ROS
with
the
spores
,
plated
them
out
on
petridishes
with
an
agar-solution
where
fungus
can
grow
on
.
A
day
after
,
we
counted
how
many
spores
were
still
alive
.
How
reliable
do
you
consider
your
results
to
be
?
The
results
we
got
are
very
reliable
.
We
had
a
lot
of
colonies
containing
a
lot
of
ants
,
and
wherever
possible
we
conducted
the
experiment
blind
.
This
means
the
experimenter
does
n't
know
which
ants
belong
to
which
treatment
,
so
it
's
impossible
to
influence
the
results
with
'
observer
bias
'
.
However
,
of
course
this
is
proof
in
just
one
species
.
It
is
hard
to
extrapolate
to
other
ants
,
as
different
species
lead
very
different
lives
.
Wikinews
interviews
President
of
the
International
Brotherhood
of
Magicians
Wednesday
,
October
9
,
2013
October
is
National
Magic
Month
in
the
United
States
.
Wikinews
spoke
with
William
Evans
,
president
of
the
International
Brotherhood
of
Magicians
,
about
the
current
state
of
magic
and
what
its
future
looks
like
in
the
world
of
entertainment
.
For
how
long
have
you
been
involved
in
performing
/
studying
magic
?
Over
50
years
.
I
am
61
now
so
I
really
started
when
I
was
about
10
years
old
even
though
I
had
seen
and
worked
with
some
basic
tricks
a
few
years
earlier
.
I
remember
going
into
Hollywood
Magic
and
wanting
that
big
red
box
with
the
dragons
on
it
and
I
did
n't
even
know
what
it
did
.
The
magician
behind
the
counter
was
wise
enough
not
to
sell
it
to
me
,
but
instead
sold
me
two
books
which
I
still
own
today
-
"
Scarne
on
Card
Tricks
"
and
"
Scarne
on
Magic
Tricks
"
.
That
started
me
out
on
books
and
I
have
amassed
quite
a
few
since
then
.
My
major
influences
on
performance
are
Eugene
Burger
and
Michael
Skinner
.
October
is
National
Magic
Month
in
the
US
.
Do
you
think
magic
is
alive
as
a
viable
form
of
entertainment
today
?
Absolutely
.
There
are
more
magicians
working
today
than
ever
before
.
There
will
always
be
an
audience
for
good
magicians
doing
good
magic
.
Has
the
internet
helped
or
hurt
magic
?
Both
.
I
think
it
has
helped
draw
younger
people
to
magic
as
a
hobby
,
but
I
think
it
has
hurt
the
ability
of
young
magicians
to
think
because
so
many
rely
on
the
internet
for
everything
and
they
are
n't
reading
the
books
.
We
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
history
of
magic
and
what
has
been
done
before
.
Moreover
,
seeing
someone
perform
on
the
internet
takes
away
the
use
of
our
senses
,
originality
and
imagination
that
reading
and
thinking
about
magic
can
produce
.
Anyone
can
become
a
monkey
;
it
takes
serious
study
to
become
a
magician
.
Do
you
travel
much
in
your
current
role
?
Yes
,
I
am
traveling
quite
a
bit
.
After
I
was
inducted
as
International
President
in
Phoenix
in
July
,
I
have
been
to
the
Jeff
McBride
Experience
in
Eureka
Springs
,
Arkansas
,
Magic
Live
in
Las
Vegas
,
The
Midwest
Magic
Jubilee
in
St.
Louis
,
the
TAOM
in
Dallas
,
the
British
Ring
Convention
in
Buxton
,
England
and
the
Magic
Circle
in
London
.
I
am
going
to
Las
Vegas
and
Los
Angeles
next
month
,
Italy
in
November
,
back
to
Las
Vegas
in
December
,
Mexico
in
January
,
Magi-Fest
in
February
,
the
Winter
Carnival
of
Magic
in
Tennessee
in
March
,
Eureka
Springs

in
March
,
and
the
FFFF
in
April
.
That
's
as
of
now

Interview
with
US
political
activist
and
philosopher
Noam
Chomsky
Saturday
,
April
4
,
2009
Political
activist
and
philosopher
Noam
Chomsky
Noam
Chomsky
is
a
professor
emeritus
at
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
in
Linguistics
and
Philosophy
.
At
the
age
of
40
he
was
credited
with
revolutionizing
the
field
of
modern
linguistics
.
He
was
one
of
the
first
opponents
of
the
Vietnam
War
,
and
is
a
self-described
Libertarian
Socialist
.
At
age
80
he
continues
to
write
books
;
his
latest
book
,
Hegemony
or
Survival
,
was
a
bestseller
in
non-fiction
.
According
to
the
Arts
and
Humanities
Citation
Index
Professor
Chomsky
is
the
eighth
most
cited
scholar
of
all
time
.
On
March
13
,
Professor
Chomsky
sat
down
with
Michael
Dranove
for
an
interview
in
his
MIT
office
in
Cambridge
,
Massachusetts
.
On
NATO
I
just
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
any
thoughts
on
recent
NATO
actions
and
the
protests
coming
up
at
the
60th
NATO
conference
,
I
know
you
’re
speaking
at
the
counter-conference
.
Could
be
I
give
so
many
talks
I
ca
n’t
remember
.
On
the
NATO
conference
,
well
I
mean
the
obvious
question
is
why
should
NATO
exist
?
In
fact
you
can
ask
questions
about
why
it
should
ever
have
existed
,
but
now
why
should
it
exist
.
I
mean
the
theory
was
,
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
,
that
it
would
be
a
defensive
alliance
against
potential
Soviet
aggression
,
that
’s
the
basic
doctrine
.
Well
there
’s
no
defense
against
Soviet
aggression
,
so
whether
you
believe
that
doctrine
or
not
that
’s
gone
.
When
the
Soviet
Union
collapsed
there
had
been
an
agreement
,
a
recent
agreement
,
between
Gorbachev
and
the
U.S
government
and
the
first
Bush
administration
.
The
agreement
was
that
Gorbachev
agreed
to
a
quite
remarkable
concession
:
he
agreed
to
let
a
united
Germany
join
the
NATO
military
alliance
.
Now
it
is
remarkable
in
the
light
of
history
,
the
history
of
the
past
century
,
Germany
alone
had
virtually
destroyed
Russia
,
twice
,
and
Germany
backed
by
a
hostile
military
alliance
,
centered
in
the
most
phenomenal
military
power
in
history
,
that
’s
a
real
threat
.
Nevertheless
he
agreed
,
but
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo
,
namely
that
NATO
should
not
expand
to
the
east
,
so
Russia
would
at
least
have
a
kind
of
security
zone
.
And
George
Bush
and
James
Baker
,
secretary
of
state
,
agreed
that
NATO
would
not
expand
one
inch
to
the
east
.
Gorbachev
also
proposed
a
nuclear
free
weapons
zone
in
the
region
,
but
the
U.S
would
n’t
consider
that
.
Okay
,
so
that
was
the
basis
on
which
then
shortly
after
the
Soviet
Union
collapsed
.
Well
,
Clinton
came
into
office
what
did
he
do
?
Well
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
back
down
on
the
promise
of
not
expanding
NATO
to
the
east
.
Well
that
’s
a
significant
threat
to
the
Soviet
Union
,
to
Russia
now
that
there
was
no
longer
any
Soviet
Union
,
it
was
a
significant
threat
to
Russia
and
not
surprisingly
they
responded
by
beefing
up
their
offensive
capacity
,
not
much
but
some
.
So
they
rescinded
their
pledge
not
to
use
nuclear
weapons
on
first
strike
,
NATO
had
never
rescinded
it
,
but
they
had
and
started
some
remilitarization
.
With
Bush
,
the
aggressive
militarism
of
the
Bush
administration
,
as
predicted
,
induced
Russia
to
extend
further
its
offensive
military
capacity
;
it
’s
still
going
on
right
now
.
When
Bush
proposed
the
missile
defense
systems
in
Eastern
Europe
,
Poland
and
Czechoslovakia
,
it
was
a
real
provocation
to
the
Soviet
Union
.
I
mean
that
was
discussed
in
U.S
arms
control
journals
,
that
they
would
have
to
regard
as
a
potential
threat
to
their
strategic
deterrent
,
meaning
as
a
first
strike
weapon
.
And
the
claim
was
that
it
had
to
do
with
Iranian
missiles
,
but
forget
about
that
.
Take
say
on
Obama
,
Obama
’s
national
security
advisor
James
Jones
former
Marine
commandant
is
on
record
of
favoring
expansion
of
NATO
to
the
south
and
the
east
,
further
expansion
of
NATO
,
and
also
making
it
an
intervention
force
.
And
the
head
of
NATO
,
Hoop
Scheffer
,
he
has
explained
that
NATO
must
take
on
responsibility
for
ensuring
the
security
of
pipelines
and
sea
lanes
,
that
is
NATO
must
be
a
guarantor
of
energy
supplies
for
the
West
.
Well
that
’s
kind
of
an
unending
war
,
so
do
we
want
NATO
to
exist
,
do
we
want
there
to
be
a
Western
military
alliance
that
carries
out
these
activities
,
with
no
pretense
of
defense
?
Well
I
think
that
’s
a
pretty
good
question
;
I
do
n’t
see
why
it
should
,
I
mean
there
happens
to
be
no
other
military
alliance
remotely
comparable
—
if
there
happened
to
be
one
I
’d
be
opposed
to
that
too
.
So
I
think
the
first
question
is
,
what
is
this
all
about
,
why
should
we
even
be
debating
NATO
,
is
there
any
reason
why
it
should
exist
?
Labor
actions
as
a
revival
of
the
Left
We
’ve
seen
mass
strikes
all
around
the
world
,
in
countries
that
we
would
n’t
expect
it
.
Do
you
think
this
is
a
revival
of
the
Left
in
the
West
?
Or
do
you
think
it
’s
nothing
?
It
’s
really
hard
to
tell
.
I
mean
there
’s
certainly
signs
of
it
,
and
in
the
United
States
too
,
in
fact
we
had
a
sit
down
strike
in
the
United
States
not
long
ago
,
which
is
a
very
militant

Sit
down
strikes
which
began
at
a
significant
level
in
the
1930’s
were
very
threatening
to
management
and
ownership
,
because
the
sit
down
strike
is
one
step
before
workers
taking
over
the
factory
and
running
it
and
kicking
out
the
management
,
and
probably
doing
a
better
job
.
So
that
’s
a
frightening
idea
,
and
police
were
called
in
and
so
on
.
Well

just
had

it
’s
hard

know

I
mean
these
things
are
just
hard
to
predict
,
they
may
take
off
,
and
they
may
take
on

broader

they

on
Santorum
cocktail
Thursday

Wikinews
interviewed
one
of
the
owners
of
a
New
York
City
bar
about
a
popular
new
politically-themed
cocktail
drink
called
Santorum
.
The
beverage
was
inspired
by
the
santorum
neologism
coined
in
advice
columnist
Dan
Savage
's
column
Savage
Love
in
response
to
comments
made
by
former
Pennsylvania
Senator
Rick
Santorum
about
homosexuality
;
Savage
's
readers
voted
to
define
santorum
as
;
"
the
frothy
mixture
of
lube
and
fecal
matter
that
is
sometimes
the
byproduct
of
anal
sex
.
"
Background
The
santorum
neologism
has
inspired
satirical
forms
of
parody
,
including
this
political
cartoon
by
Saturday

Stan
commented
on
the
creation
of
the

,
"
When

I
thought
,
'
OK

I
'll
do
a

'
.
"
Regarding
how
long
the
beverage
will
be
made
available
,
Stan
remarked
to
The

,
"
We
'll
keep
it
around

he
’s
there

main
ingredients
of
the
Santorum
drink
include
vodka
of
an
orange

Rick
Santorum
In
a
2003
interview
with
the
Associated
Press
,
Rick
Santorum
compared
legalizing
same-sex
marriage
in
the
United
States
to
supporting
bestiality
.
Readers
of
the
Savage
Love
advice
column
selected
a
new
definition
for
the
Senator
’s
last
name
,
and
Savage
created
a
website
SpreadingSantorum.com
to
promulgate
the
spread
of
the
phenomenon
.
The
term
became
a
prominent
result
in
searches
online
,
and
gained
dominance
on
Web
search
engines
including
Google
,
Bing
,
and

Rick
Santorum
himself
has
acknowledged
and
discussed

he
was

Interview
What
inspired
you
to
create
a
cocktail
after
the
santorum
neologism
?
Santorum
the
person
has
been
in
the
news
throughout
the
primary
season
,
and
we
thought
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
to
create
a
delicious
drink
that
mimicked
the
appearance
of
the
Dan
Savage
meaning
of
"
santorum
.
"
How
did
you
first
hear
about
the
definition
of
the
santorum
neologism
that
grew
out
of
the
contest
from
the
Savage
Love
advice
column
?
We
do
n't
really
remember
.
It
's
been
around
forever
.
Probably
read
about
it
somewhere
.
What
are
your
thoughts
about
Rick
Santorum
’s
views
on
gay
rights
?
It
's
not
for
us
to
take
a
stand
on
any
political
issues
.
We
'll
leave
that
to
the
professionals
.
Do
you
think
it
was
an
appropriate
form
of
satire
for
Dan
Savage
to
popularize
the
definition
of
the
santorum
neologism
created
in
his
advice
column
?
We
thought
it
was
funny
.
Whether
it
is
appropriate
or
not
is
another
thing
we
leave
to
the
pros
to
decide
.
When
was
the
Santorum
cocktail
first
created
?
A
few
months
ago
.
What
ingredients
go
in
the
Santorum
cocktail
?
Bailey
's
,
orange
vodka
,
bitters
,
and
chocolate
flakes
.
How
is
the
Santorum
drink
made
?
The
ingredients
are
shaken
and/or
poured
into
a
cocktail
glass
.
See
the
pictures
.
Your
Santorum
cocktail
creation
has
already
received
media
coverage
from
publications
including
;
The
Brooklyn
Paper
,
The
New
York
Times
,
Jezebel
,
Metro.us
,
EDGE
on
the
Net
,
and
Instinct
Magazine
.
Did
you
think
when
you
created
it
that
the
Santorum
cocktail
would
receive
this
news
coverage
?
Not
at
all
.
We
were
just
trying
to
come
up
with
a
topical
and
funny
new
cocktail
for
our
customers
to
laugh
about
and
enjoy
.
What
culinary
dishes
would
you
recommend
that
go
well
with
the
Santorum
cocktail
?
You
'd
probably
be
having
the
cocktail
at
dessert
time
,
so
something
sweet
;
ice
cream
or
pie
.
Is
the
drink
popular
?
How
many
times
do
you
suppose
you
’ve
served
it
at
your
establishment
since
its
creation
?
The
drink
was
mildly
popular
for
the
last
few
months
,
but
of
course
has
become
a
great
deal
more
popular
since
getting
all
this
publicity
.
We
have
no
way
to
estimate
how
many
times
we
've
served
it
overall
,
but
we
're
now
pouring
around
ten
a
night
.

Wikinews
interviews
Marymegan
Daly
on
unusual
new
sea
anemone
Tuesday
,
January
21
,
2014
How
did
you
come
to
be
involved
with
this
discovery
Frank
Rack
got
in
touch
after
they
returned
from
Antarctica
in
hopes
that
I
could
help
with
an
identification
on
the
anemone
.
What
was
your
first
reaction
upon
learning
there
was
an
undiscovered
ecosystem
under
the
ice
in
the
Ross
Sea
?
I
was
amazed
and
really
excited
.
I
think
to
say
it
was
unexpected
is
inaccurate
,
because
it
implies
that
there
was
a
well-founded
expectation
of
something
.
The
technology
that
Frank
and
his
colleagues
are
using
to
explore
the
ice
is
so
important
because
,
given
our
lack
of
data
,
we
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
what
it
should
be
like
,
or
what
it
should
n't
be
like
.
There
's
a
return
trip
planned
hopefully
for
2015
,
with
both
biologists
and
ANDRILL
geologists
.
Are
you
intending
to
go
there
yourself
?
I
would
love
to
.
But
I
am
also
happy
to
not
go
,
as
long
as
someone
collects
more
animals
on
my
behalf
!
What
I
want
to
do
with
the
animals
requires
new
material
preserved
in
diverse
ways
,
but
it
does
n't
require
me
to
be
there
.
Although
I
am
sure
that
being
there
would
enhance
my
understanding
of
the
animals
and
the
system
in
which
they
live
,
and
would
help
me
formulate
more
and
better
questions
about
the
anemones
,
ship
time
is
expensive
,
especially
in
Antarctica
,
and
if
there
are
biologists
whose
contribution
is
predicated
on
being
there
,
they
should
have
priority
to
be
there
.
These
animals
are
shrouded
in
mystery
.
Some
of
the
most
intriguing
questions
are
chemical
;
do
they
produce
some
kind
of
antifreeze
,
and
is
that
orange
glow
in
the
ROV
lights
their
own
?
Talk
us
through
the
difficulties
encountered
when
trying
to
find
answers
with
the
specimens
on
hand
.
The
samples
we
have
are
small
in
terms
of
numbers
and
they
are
all
preserved
in
formalin
(
a
kind
of
formaldehyde
solution
)
.
The
formalin
is
great
for
preserving
structures
,
but
for
anemones
,
it
prevents
study
of
DNA
or
of
the
chemistry
of
the
body
.
This
means
we
ca
n't
look
at
the
issue
you
raise
with
these
animals
.
What
we
could
do
,
however
,
was
to
study
anatomy
and
figure
out
what
it
is
,
so
that
when
we
have
samples
preserved
for
studying
e.g.
,
the
genome
,
transcriptome
,
or
metabolome
,
or
conduct
tests
of
the
fluid
in
the
burrows
or
in
the
animals
themselves
,
we
can
make
precise
comparisons
,
and
figure
out
what
these
animals
have
or
do
(
metabolically
or
chemically
)
that
lets
them
live
where
they
live
.
Just
knowing
a
whole
lot
about
a
single
species
is
n't
very
useful
,
even
if
that
animal
is
as
special
as
these
clearly
are
-
we
need
to
know
what
about
them
is
different
and
thus
related
to
living
in
this
strange
way
.
The
only
way
to
get
at
what
's
different
is
to
make
comparisons
with
close
relatives
.
We
can
start
that
side
of
the
work
now
,
anticipating
having
more
beasts
in
the
future
.
In
terms
of
their
glow
,
I
suspect
that
it
's
not
theirs
-
although
luminescence
is
common
in
anemone
relatives
,
they
do
n't
usually
make
light
themselves
.
They
do
make
a
host
of
florescent
proteins
,
and
these
may
interact
with
the
light
of
the
ROV
to
give
that
gorgeous
glow
.
What
analysis
did
you
perform
on
the
specimens
and
what
equipment
was
used
?
I
used
a
dissecting
scope
to
look
at
the
animal
's
external
anatomy
and
overall
body
organization
(
magnification
of
60
X
)
.
I
embedded
a
few
of
the
animals
in
wax
and
then
cut
them
into
very
thin
slices
using
a
microtome
,
mounted
the
slices
on
microscope
slides
,
stained
the
slices
to
enhance
contrast
,
and
then
looked
at
those
slides
under
a
compound
microscope
(
that
's
how
I
got
the
pictures
of
the
muscles
etc
in
the
paper
)
.
I
used
that
same
compound
scope
to
look
at
squashed
bits
of
tissue
to
see
the
stinging
capsules
(
=
nematocysts
)
.
I
compared
the
things
I
saw
under
the
'scopes
to
what
had
been
published
on
other
species
in
this
group
.
This
step
seems
trivial
,
but
it
is
really
the
most
important
part
!
By
comparing
my
observations
to
what
my
colleagues
and
predecessors
had
found
,
I
figured
out
what
group
it
belongs
to
,
and
was
able
to
determine
that
within
that
group
,
it
was
a
new
species
.
It
was
three
years
between
recovery
of
specimens
and
final
publication
,
why
did
it
take
so
long
?
You
mean
,
how
did
we
manage
to
make
it
all
happen
so
quickly
,
right
?
:)
It
was
about
two
years
from
when
Frank
sent
me
specimens
to
when
we
got
the
paper
out
.
Some
of
that
time
was
just
lost
time
-
I
had
other
projects
in
the
queue
that
I
needed
to
finish
.
Once
we
figured
out
what
it
was
,
we
played
a
lot
of
manuscript
email
tag
,
which
can
be
challenging
and
time
consuming
given
the
differing
schedules
that
folks
keep
in
terms
of
travel
,
field
work
,
etc.
Manuscript
review
and
processing
took
about
four
months
.
What
sort
of
difficulties
were
posed
by
the
unorthodox
preservatives
used
,
and
what
additional
work
might
be
possible
on
a
specimen
with
intact
DNA
?
The
preservation
was
not
unorthodox
-
they
followed
best
practices
for
anatomical
preservation
.
Having
DNA-suitable
material
will
let
us
see
whether
there
are
new
genes
,
or
genes
turned
on
in
different
ways
and
at
different
times
that
help
explain
how
these
animals
burrow
into
hard
ice
and
then
survive
in
the
cold
.
I
am
curious
about
the
population
structure
of
the
"
fields
"
of
anemones
-
the
group
to
which
Edwardsiella
andrillae
belongs
includes
many
species
that
reproduce
asexually
,
and
it
's
possible
that
the
fields
are
"
clones
"
produced
asexually
rather
than
the
result
of
sexual
reproduction
.
DNA
is
the
only
way
to
test
this
.

There
's
a
misconception
in
this
industry
.
Your
exposure
to
this
is
probably
primarily
what
you
see
in
movies
,
scanning
magazines
,
scanning
the
Internet
,
just
snippets
everywhere
.
It
's
portrayed
as
though
it
's
dark
,
black
and
evil
.
And
--
Oh
man
,
well
?
What
's
up
?
I
do
wear
a
lot
of
black
.
It
's
anything
but
that
.
If
you
look
at
the
rooms
,
there
's
all
the
accouterments
you
'd
find
in
these
types
of
places
--
but
more
than
anything
,
there
's
a
lot
of
good
feeling
around
here
.
We
hire
the
opposite
of
what
you
'd
think
we
would
hire
,
what
the
average
person
would
think
we
would
hire
.
We
hire
educated
,
nice
people
.
I
remember
one
of
our
ads
that
I
had
put
in
said
,
"
If
you
think
nice
girls
do
n't
do
S&M
,
"
--
I
forgot
what
the
rest
of
it
said
--
--
think
again
.
Yeah
,
"
think
again
"
or
something
like
that
.
And
that
ad
had
pulled
so
many
girls
,
because
they
--
I
think
they
all
thought
that
nice
girls
do
n't
do
this
.
And
a
bunch
of
them
had
called
and
they
said
,
"
Wow
.
"
And
I
think
I
remember
,
a
bunch
of
guys
called
because
of
that
also
.
Do
you
remember
?
I
sure
do
,
I
sure
do
.
What
are
the
startup
costs
involved
?
It
varies
;
look
around
Manhattan
,
look
around
rents
,
look
around
build-outs
,
look
around
hiring
,
look
around
advertising
...
What
's
your
greatest
non-fixed
cost
?
The
single
most
costly
thing
we
spend
on
is
rent
and
advertising
,
those
two
together
make
up
the
bulk
of
what
we
spend
.
There
's
supplies
,
and
there
's
wear
and
tear
and
maintenance
,
and
bookkeeping
and
things
like
that
that
you
have
to
do
.
That
's
about
it
.
The
hardest
thing
in
running
this
business
,
which
is
why
people
ca
n't
do
it
,
is
the
relationship
that
my
wife
has
with
the
gals
and
with
the
customers
.
Where
do
you
advertise
?
A
lot
on
the
web
,
we
've
used
most
of
the
local
city
papers
,
New
York
Press
,
things
like
that
,
L
Magazine
.
In
the
back
of
the
paper
?
Typically
in
the
back
of
the
paper
.
Magazines
constantly
change
their
policy
on
it
;
they
want
it
,
they
do
n't
want
it
...
Depending
on
the
election
year
--
Who
's
buying
the
paper
,
who
's
selling
the
paper
.
So
it
changes
,
so
one
year
we
got
to
be
in
the
Press
,
but
they
have
now
stopped
adult
ads
.
Completely
.
So
now
we
'll
be
in
the
Voice
for
a
while
.
We
're
moving
more
towards
the
Internet
at
this
point
,
because
the
Internet
is
a
much
easier
,
safer
way
for
a
person
to
look
at
sensitive
material
and
not
get
caught
with
it
.
Hiring
employees
Personality
test
questions
given
to
prospective
mistresses
.
Pursuant
to
your
business
question
:
we
only
hire
nice
people
.
I
do
n't
care
if
a
girl
is
absolutely
exquisite
looking
--
My
husband
has
met
beautiful
,
beautiful
girls
--
--
beautiful
girls
--
--
and
he
's
in
the
end
,
he
would
say
,
"
Well
,
I
wo
n't
hire
them
.
"
I
'm
like
,
‘
Are
you
insane
?
I
wo
n't
hire
them
.
I
hire
--
Why
not
?
Because
I
want
someone
who
's
going
to
treat
people
nicely
and
well
.
We
have
--
How
can
you
tell
whether
they
will
or
will
not
?
Just
by
talking
to
them
?
Having
been
a
psychologist
for
a
number
of
years
gives
me
a
leg
up
on
it
.
And
he
's
been
right
.
And
I
have
made
him
hire
these
girls
,
and
ultimately
he
's
been
right
They
've
been
complete
pain
in
the
asses
!
I
also
have
a
profile
they
fill
out
for
me
,
a
mini-MMPI
that
I
developed
,
so
that
I
have
an
idea
--
Rebecca
and
I
put
it
together
I
do
n't
know
if
you
'd
like
to
see
one
.
No
,
no
,
no
.
Just
--
I
could
show
you
.
So
I
have
a
mini-MMPI
that
I
--
Could
I
have
a
sample
,
not
necessarily
one
that
's
filled
out
,
but
just
one
that
you
--
I
'll
show
you
.
The
questions
are
--
Be
careful
.
He
'll
make
you
fill
one
out
.
You
'd
be
scared
.
You
would
n't
hire
me
.
Is
it
only
girls
you
hire
?
Yeah
.
What
would
a
question
like
"
the
greatest
woman
in
the
world
"
reveal
to
you
?
No
question
would
reveal
anything
independently
of
all
the
questions
together
--
Sure
.
--
but
I
have
a
chart
that
I
'll
go
through
;
the
MMPI
.
The
baseline
data
that
I
use
to
--
How
did
you
originate
these
questions
?
Where
did
I
make
them
?
You
get
a
baseline
from
asking
girls
and
refining
profiles
--
And
it
's
an
amalgamation
of
questions
.
Of
many
,
many
questions
--
What
's
your
favorite
question
?
I
do
n't
know
,
the
O.J.
Simpson
….
Yeah
,
I
see
O.J.
Simpson
.
What
would
that
be
an
indicator
of
?
I
'm
not
sure
which
one
you
gave
him
,
but
there
's
a
brief
,
brief
,
brief
IQ
test
there
.
Very
brief
.
Do
you
ask
for
references
?
No
,
because
I
really
ca
n't
call
and
tell
them
I
'm
yeah
,
so-and-so
's
applying
here
for
a
position
.

Interview
For
our
readers
who
are
unaware
of
your
site
,
could
you
briefly
explain
what
wikiHow
is
?
Sure
.
wikiHow
is
a
collaborative
effort
to
build
the
world
's
largest
,
highest
quality
how-to
manual
.
Our
long
term
goal
is
to
produce
practical
instructions
on
almost
every
topic
in
every
language
.
We
're
quite
far
from
our
goals
currently
,
but
we
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
every
month
wikiHow
gets
noticeably
better
and
larger
We
currently
have
just
under
50000
articles
and
over
1000
featured
articles
.
We
hope
that
in
time
,
we
will
have
millions
of
articles
with
many
of
them
having
featured
status
.
That
said
,
we
are
realistic
enough
to
realize
that
this
goal
will
take
decades
to
achieve
.
However
,
in
terms
of
readership
,
we
are
probably
the
most
popular
single
subject
wiki
after
Wikipedia
.
We
get
over
14
million
unique
visitors
per
month
(
source
:
Google
Analytics
)
,
which
makes
us
the
135th
most
popular
site
according
to
Quantcast
.
[
Note
:
The
interview
took
place
just
before
the
50000
milestone
was
met
]
Like
Wikipedia
,
wikiHow
is
a
wiki
that
runs
on
Mediawiki
software
.
Our
community
is
full
of
volunteers
from
all
over
the
world
.
That
said
,
we
are
quite
different
from
Wikipedia
in
several
respects
:
We
are
much
smaller
.
The
English
wikiHow
has
only
60
admins
,
compared
to
the
1000
+
on
English
Wikipedia
.
As
a
result
,
wikiHow
is
still
at
the
size
that
every
editor
eventually
gets
to
know
other
editors
.
We
are
run
as
a
Hybrid
Organization
-
a
for-profit
company
focused
on
achieving
a
social
good
.
This
has
several
advantages
and
disadvantages
when
compared
to
the
non-profit
structure
at
the
Wikimedia
Foundation
.
We
show
opt-out
advertising
to
anonymous
visitors
rather
than
ask
for
donations
.
Our
advertising
revenue
funds
community
meetups
and
has
even
allowed
us
to
donate
over
$
60,000
to
charities
such
as
the
Wikimedia
Foundation
and
Creative
Commons
.
(
http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity
)
.
In
addition
,
we
've
used
our
revenue
on
things
like
buying
carbon
offsets
to
become
carbon
neutral
.
(
http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral
)
Our
community
culture
is
focused
on
wikiLove
and
civility
.
As
a
result
some
folks
believe
wikiHow
is
a
more
humane
and
enjoyable
place
to
work
than
other
places
online
.
Why
did
you
decide
to
create
wikiHow
?
I
think
that
providing
people
with
a
practical
education
is
one
of
the
most
empowering
things
you
can
offer
a
person
.
Imagine
having
detailed
step-by-step
instructions
on
how
to
do
any
activity
you
could
imagine
.
How
much
more
could
you
accomplish
as
an
individual
if
you
could
learn
any
activity
?
I
think
that
building
a
universal
how-to
manual
would
be
a
tremendous
gift
for
the
world
.
Knowledge
is
power
and
wikiHow
has
the
potential
to
make
all
of
us
a
bit
more
powerful
.
I
've
been
interested
in
building
a
comprehensive
how-to
manual
long
before
I
first
envisioned
wikiHow
.
My
first
attempt
at
building
this
resource
was
a
website
I
used
to
run
called
eHow
.
eHow
was
and
continues
to
be
the
largest
and
how
to
website
in
the
world
.
eHow
contains
copyrighted
content
run
on
proprietary
software
.
When
I
ran
eHow
,
the
content
was
professionally
produced
and
edited
.
This
business
model
worked
for
producing
content
on
topics
that
appeal
to
advertisers
in
languages
like
English
that
have
large
advertising
markets
.
However
,
paying
people
to
write
and
edit
articles
ultimately
means
that
you
have
to
make
one
of
two
sacrifices
.
You
either
1
)
sacrifice
on
breadth
and
do
n't
produce
the
topics
that
wo
n't
interest
advertisers
,
or
2
)
you
sacrifice
on
quality
and
produce
content
that
does
n't
cost
much
to
write
.
I
was
n't
interested
in
making
either
of
these
sacrifices
,
as
I
think
the
world
's
how
to
manual
needs
to
be
high
quality
AND
comprehensive
.
So
ultimately
I
decided
that
eHow
's
model
would
not
build
the
resource
I
envisioned
.
When
I
discovered
Wikipedia
,
I
recognized
that
the
wiki
model
had
the
potential
to
build
the
how-to
resource
the
world
really
needs
.
So
I
decided
to
sell
eHow
and
use
the
proceeds
to
build
wikiHow
.
Why
did
you
decide
to
use
a
Creative
Commons
license
?
We
use
a
Creative
Commons
license
to
give
our
community
the
right
to
fork
(
http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork
)
.
In
my
opinion
,
people
should
be
hesitant
to
contribute
to
websites
where
you
only
have
the
"
right
to
leave
.
"
If
wikiHow
volunteers
think
our
site
is
going
in
the
wrong
direction
,
they
can
take
all
the
content
and
all
the
software
and
move
the
project
elsewhere
.
This
is
possible
because
we
release
all
of
our
software
under
the
Open
Source
GPL
license
and
release
our
content
under
a
Creative
Commons
license
.
This
right
to
fork
guarantees
that
wikiHow
,
the
company
,
will
always
serve
the
goal
of
the
mission
and
our
volunteer
community
.
I
believe
that
offering
this
right
to
fork
has
been
a
key
element
of
our
success
thus
far
.
My
hope
is
that
over
time
,
internet
users
will
demand
this
of
any
site
where
they
invest
their
time
in
a
way
that
creates
value
for
others
.
That
said
,
when
we
started
out
I
did
n't
know
the
difference
between
the
GNU
Free
Document
License
and
my
California
Driver
's
license
.
As
a
result
,
we
made
some
mistakes
along
the
path
.
In
retrospect
,
I
think
we
probably
should
have
selected
the
CC
BY-SA
license
instead
of
CC-BY-SA-NC
.
At
a
minimum
this
would
provide
a
helpful
compatibility
with
other
wikis
and
free
culture
projects
.
wikiHow
now
has
millions
of
visitors
per
month
.
How
did
you
grow
the
site
to
the
size
it
is
today
?
In
December
2008
,
wikiHow
had
over
14
million
unique
visitors
according
to
Google
Analytics
(
Full
data
:
http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics
)
.
Quantcast
ranks
wikiHow
as
the
135th
most
popular
site
in
the
US
.
(
http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com
)
.
wikiHow
achieved
this
popularity
for
a
few
reasons
.
First
,
people
around
the
world
are
desperate
for
high
quality
how-to
information
.
People
want
to
learn
more
practical
skills
,
and
for
the
most
part
the
internet
does
n't
provide
enough
quality
information
yet
.
Second
,
we
attracted
millions
of
readers
via
the
virtuous
circle
of
wiki
editing
:
We
had
some
articles
of
mixed
quality
,
and
editors
joined
to
improve
those
articles
,
which
in
turn
attracted
more
readers
.
We
continue
to
depend
on
this
same
virtuous
cycle
:
More
readers
,
means
more
editors
,
which
creates
better
instructions
,
leading
again
to
more
readers
.
It
is
the
same
virtuous
circle
that
Wikipedia
has
enjoyed
.

attitudes

Games

in

days

,
Wikinews
interviewed
Assistant
Professor
in
Educational
Leadership
,
Sport
Studies
and
Educational
/
Counseling
Psychology
at
Washington
State
University
Simon
Ličen
about
attitudes
in
United
States
towards
the
Paralympics
.
Ličen
has
recently
joined
the
Sport
Management
Program
at
Washington
State
University
to
develop
its
sport
media
and
communication
research
and
teaching
contents
.
Originally
from
Slovenia
,
he
served
as
the
Director
of
Media
and
Communications
of
a
WTA
Tour
event
and
was
a
member
of
the
UNESCO
Slovenian
National
Commission
.
He
was
also
the
Team
Manager
of
the
Slovenian
wheelchair
basketball
national
team
.
Why
do
you
think
the
Paralympic
movement
has
so
little
visibility
in
the
US
compared
to
other
countries
like
Australia
,
the
United
Kingdom
and
even
Canada
?
Sports
in
the
United
States
largely
reaffirm
existing
relations
of
power
in
society
.
It
emphasizes
consumerism
,
the
belief
that
success
always
goes
to
people
who
merit
it
due
to
their
abilities
,
dedication
and
qualifications
,
and
reinforces
,
rather
than
changes
,
existing
ideas
related
to
gender
,
ethnicity
and
nationality
.
Paralympic
sport
brings
attention
to
athletes
who
are
typically
overlooked
in
American
society
because
the
majority
of
the
population
does
not
want
to
identify
with
people
who
are
disabled
.
Although
disability
is
not
contagious
,
interest
in
disabled
sports
might
put
into
question
the
masculinity
of
the
males
following
it
.
Disabled
athletes
also
challenge
existing
relations
of
power
by
displaying
dedication
,
hard
work
and
perseverance
in
different
contexts
than
those
most
sports
fans
are
accustomed
to
.
Other
countries
,
including
the
ones
you
mention
,
have
stronger
social
orientations
in
all
aspects
of
society
.
Even
though
legislative
support
may
be
less
strong
than
the
one
provided
by
the
Americans
with
Disabilities
Act
,
many
social
institutions
including
the
media
are
more
receptive
to
this
form
of
diversity
.
What
do
you
think
the
impact
will
be
for
the
Paralympic
movement
will
be
with
the
Games
being
televised
live
in
the
United
States
for
first
time
?
The
impact
depends
on
a
number
of
aspects
.
One
of
them
is
the
channels
that
NBC
as
the
broadcasting
rights
owner
for
the
United
States
will
use
to
air
the
Paralympic
Games
on
.
Will
they
be
shown
nationally
or
regionally
,
on
NBC
or
on
any
of
the
company
’s
multiple
cable
networks
?
A
second
aspect
is
the
parts
or
hours
of
the
day
the
Paralympics
will
be
shown
.
Remember
that
there
is
a
nine-hour
difference
between
Sochi
and
New
York
,
and
a
12-hour
difference
between
Sochi
and
the
US
West
Coast
.
So
daytime
events
will
be
shown
live
in
the
United
States
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
evening
prime-time
events
will
be
shown
—
indeed
live
—
in
the
morning
U.S.
time
.
So
showing
the
Paralympics
live
on
United
States
television
might
turn
out
to
be
less
glamorous
than
it
appears
.
A
third
important
factor
is
the
way
the
event
will
be
mediated
:
will
NBC
have
its
best
sports
broadcasters
following
the
event
after
having
worked
the
Winter
Olympics
?
Will
they
treat
and
announce
the
competitions
as
they
do
all
others
—
for
better
and
worse
?
Will
they
take
it
as
an
opportunity
to
educate
viewers
about
disability
and
diversity
while
showing
superb
athletic
performances
without
engaging
in
a
discourse
of
pity
?
All
in
all
,
I
think
this
is
a
terrific
opportunity
to
improve
sports
coverage
in
a
multitude
of
aspects
;
but
we
will
have
to
wait
until
after
the
event
to
assess
to
what
extent
the
broadcasters
will
meet
these
expectations
.

Australia
women
's
national
wheelchair
basketball
team
,
known
as
the
Gliders
.
McKenzie
,
a
silver
and
bronze
Paralympic
medalist
in
wheelchair
basketball
,
retired
from
the
game
after
the
2012
Summer
Paralympics
in
London
.
Wikinews
caught
up
with
her
in
a
cafe
in
the
leafy
Melbourne
suburb
of
Preston
.
[
The
Spitfire
Tournament
in
Canada
]
was
a
really
good
tournament
actually
.
It
was
a
tournament
that
I
wish
we
'd
actually
gone
back
to
more
often
.
Who
plays
in
that
one
?
It
's
quite
a
large
Canadian
tournament
,
and
so
we
went
as
the
Gliders
team
.
So
we
were
trying
to
get
as
many
international
games
as
possible
.
Cause
that
's
one
of
our
problems
really
,
to
compete
.
It
costs
us
so
much
money
to
for
us
to
travel
overseas
and
to
compete
internationally
.
And
so
we
can
compete
against
each
other
all
the
time
within
Australia
but
we
really
need
to
be
able
to
...
It
's
not
the
same
.
No
,
it
's
really
not
,
so
it
's
really
important
to
be
able
to
get
as
a
many
international
trips
throughout
the
year
to
continue
our
improvement
.
Also
see
where
all
the
other
teams
are
at
as
well
.
But
yes
,
Spitfire
was
good
.
We
took
quite
a
few
new
girls
over
there
back
then
in
2005
,
leading
into
the
World
Cup
in
the
Netherlands
.
Was
that
the
one
where
you
were
the
captain
of
the
team
,
in
2005
?
Or
was
that
a
later
one
?
No
,
I
captained
in
2010
.
So
2009
,
2010
World
Cup
.
And
then
I
had
a
bit
of
some
time
off
in
2011
.
The
Gliders
have
never
won
the
World
Championship
.
We
always
seem
to
have
just
a
little
bit
of
a
chill
out
at
the
World
Cup
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
It
's
really
strange
occurrence
,
over
the
years
.
2002
World
Cup
,
we
won
bronze
.
Then
in
2006
we
ended
up
fourth
.
It
was
one
of
the
worst
World
Cups
we
've
played
actually
.
And
then
in
2010
we
just
...
I
do
n't
know
what
happened
.
We
just
did
n't
play
as
well
as
we
thought
we
would
.
Came
fourth
.
But
you
know
what
?
Fired
us
up
for
the
actual
Paralympics
.
So
the
World
Cup
is
...
it
's
good
to
be
able
to
do
well
at
the
World
Cup
,
to
be
placed
,
but
it
also
means
that
you
get
a
really
good
opportunity
to
know
where
you
're
at
in
that
two
year
gap
between
the
Paralympics
.
So
you
can
come
back
home
and
revisit
what
you
need
to
do
and
,
you
know
,
where
the
team
's
at
.
And
all
that
sort
of
stuff
.
Unfortunately
,
they
are
talking
about
moving
it
so
it
will
be
on
the
year
before
the
Paralympics
.
Oh
really
.
The
competition
from
the
[
FIFA
]
World
Cup
and
all
.
Right
.
Well
,
that
would
be
sad
.

An
Interview
with
the
'
Mets
Poet
'
Wednesday
,
October
3
,
2007
You
have
received
a
good
deal
of
attention
recently
.
Even
though
I
m
not
Michael
Jackson
or
somebody
,
when
people
come
up
to
me
and
introduce
themselves
and
say
,
'
Hey
Frank
,
my
name
is
John
,
'
I
say
,
'
Hey
John
,
my
name
is
Frank
'
and
they
laugh
.
It
's
a
funny
phenomenon
.
What
goes
through
your
head
when
that
happens
?
I
understand
it
.
I
've
gone
to
readings
and
concerts
.
I
look
at
it
as
human
interaction
.
Over
the
years
I
have
performed
in
32
countries
and
40
states
.
I
've
been
doing
this
professionally
since
I
was
in
my
twenties
,
and
before
that
since
I
was
sixteen
doing
little
tidbit
poetry
readings
in
coffeehouses
.
The
band
I
started
in
1993
,
Spoken
Motion
,
received
a
lot
of
recognition
as
a
spoken
word
band
born
out
of
the
New
York
spoken
word
scene
.
I
worked
with
some
great
musicians
and
performed
around
the
world
.
I
remember
signing
my
first
autograph
to
a
kid
when
I
was
25
years
old
.
As
time
went
on
,
I
came
out
with
books
and
CDs
,
and
I
became
used
to
that
kind
of
thing
.
To
me
,
the
ultimate
feeling
of
success
as
an
artist
,
is
to
move
somebody
enough
where
they
thank
you
.
When
someone
comes
up
and
says
,
'
Frank
,
thank
you
,
your
work
is
great
.
"
You
have
a
long
career
in
poetry
,
but
as
of
late
the
attention
you
have
garnered
is
for
the
Mets-inspired
work
.
How
do
you
feel
about
having
a
lot
of
your
work
overshadowed
by
the
Mets
work
?
It
's
ironic
.
Some
of
the
greatest
poetry
has
been
born
out
of
failure
and
the
depths
of
adversity
in
the
human
experience
.
Walt
Whitman
,
the
first
great
American
poet
,
wrote
about
the
Civil
War
.
He
went
looking
for
his
brother
,
George
Whitman
,
after
he
a
telegram
telling
him
his
brother
was
injured
in
the
South
.
When
he
started
out
his
poems
were
about
beating
drums
,
and
blow
,
bugle
,
blow
.
Real
patriotic
.
Then
he
started
to
see
the
real
horrors
of
war
.
He
was
able
to
tap
into
the
human
condition
and
the
situation
at
that
time
.
Eventually
when
he
found
his
brother
he
had
resolution
.
I
experienced
that
kind
of
adversity
during
9/11
being
a
civilian
volunteer
.
I
loaded
ferry
boats
in
Jersey
City
across
the
river
to
deliver
goods
to
Ground
Zero
.
I
turned
to
Whitman
to
find
some
understanding
of
what
is
happening
in
the
world
right
now
.
When
I
wrote
my
9/11-related
poems
,
that
was
true
adversity
.
I
realize
baseball
is
just
a
game
.
Can
you
recite
a
stanza
that
expresses
how
you
feel
right
now
?
This
was
a
piece
that
the
Times
only
quoted
one
stanza
,
but
it
's
about
preparation
for
a
battle
,
and
being
prepared
to
either
rise
to
the
occasion
,
or
go
down
:
Do
you
know
what
it
's
like
to
be
chased
by
the
Ghost
of
Failure
while
staring
through
Victory
's
door
?
Of
course
you
do
,
you
're
a
Mets
fan
caught
in
a
do-or-die
moment
in
late
September
at
Shea
As
one
that
s
battled
hard
through
many
a
broken
dream
Let
me
say
,
"
in
order
to
rise
to
the
occasion
you
must
be
willing
to
go
down
with
the
ship
"
,
Have
no
fear
,
no
hesitation
,
for
Winning
shall
be
it's
reward
!
Do
n't
let
them
get
in
your
head
!
you
've
kept
it
up
this
long
You
're
a
Mets
fan
in
late
September
and
you
ll
fight
til
the
glorious
end
Cheer
the
team
today
;
(
your
boys
in
orange
and
blue
)
Let
them
hear
you
shout
as
they
fight
for
what
's
mightily
due

Sports

Have
you
had
interaction
with
"
new
readers
'
through
your
Mets
work
?
This
one
person
who
I
never
met
took
a
picture
of
me
and
sent
it
to
me
in
an
e-mail
.
The
e-mail
said
,
'
Frank
,
I
have
never
bothered
you
during
the
game
,
but
I
just
wanted
to
say
thank
you
for
your
work
and
thank
you
for
making
some
sense
of
the
successes
and
failures
and
I
wish
you
much
success
with
your
work
.
'
Last
year
in
my
section
at
the
stadium
I
had
a
banner
that
read
We
Know
'
.
That
's
all
it
said
.
Then
earlier
this
year
these
shirts
started
to
come
out
that
said
,
"
Poet
says
We
Know
"
.
It
was
amazing
.
We
did
n't
use
the
banner
this
year
,
though
,
because
we
did
n't
know
.
The
team
was
n't
so
far
ahead
that
we
knew
.
Last
year
we
just
knew
we
were
going
to
the
playoffs
;
we
knew
we
were
going
post-season
.
This
year
we
were
n't
sure
.
We
were
walking
on
eggshells
.
There
was
a
woman
,
a
season
ticket
holder
and
a
die
hard
fan
.
She
was
staggered
by
the
loss
last
year
to
the
Cardinals
.
Last
year
she
came
up
to
me
during
one
of
the
games
late
in
the
season
;
she
was
so
happy
we
were
going
to
the
post
season
.
By
that
point
we
had
clinched
it
.
She
handed
me
a
shirt
she
bought
at
the
stadium
and
she
gave
me
a
big
hug
.
With
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
Mets
Poet
,
thank
you
.
"
It
's
cool
...
it
's
like
another
family
.
Moments
like
that
must
make
you
realize
you
have
touched
people
who
are
n't
normally
touched
by
poetry
.
It
's
opened
up
a
new
fan
base
,
so
to
speak
.
For
the
last
year
SNY
has
broadcast
footage
of
me
with
my
poems
,
so
quite
a
few
fans
known
about
the
"
Mets
Poet
'
.
I
have
never
called
myself
that
,
by
the
way
.
The
back
of
my
jersey
says
"
The
Poet
'
because
growing
up
that
was
my
nickname
.
My
brother
was
a
runner
and
they
used
to
call
him
The
Birdman
--
Birdie
--
and
they
called
me
The
Poet
.
It
was
a
natural
thing
,
but
I
never
coined
myself
as
'
The
Mets
Poet

How
The
Onion
writes
an
issue
This
exclusive
interview
features
first-hand
journalism
by
a
Wikinews
reporter
.
See
the
collaboration
page
for
more
details
.
How
do
you
decide
on
the
stories
?
We
do
everything
backwards
here
.
We
start
with
the
headline
and
then
flesh
out
the
story
,
as
opposed
to
The
New
York
Times
,
which
writes
the
issue
and
then
has
a
headline
editor
to
make
it
snappy
.
We
start
with
a
joke
.
We
read
about
six
hundred
to
eight
hundred
headline
ideas
on
a
Monday
coming
from
our
staff
and
a
small
group
of
writers
outside
—
a
contributing
core
.
We
whittle
that
down
on
a
Monday
to
about
a
hundred
,
come
in
Tuesday
and
pick
an
issue
and
brainstorm
with
the
whole
editorial
staff
;
all
fifteen
of
us
.
Then
we
assign
a
headline
to
a
specific
writer
to
execute
.
We
go
through
a
number
of
drafts
and
then
have
the
editors
pick
it
up
and
assign
the
photojournalism
aspect
of
it
to
our
graphic
design
team
,
who
adds
the
visual
aspect
to
it
.
The
editors
punch
it
up
over
the
last
couple
of
days
and
then
it
goes
out
over
the
Internet
and
into
the
print
edition
.
So
you
do
n’t
have
writers
coming
up
with
a
story
and
headline
,
but
you
will
instead
have
a
team
of
writers
choosing
the
best
headlines
and
then
assign
it
to
a
particular
writer
who
was
not
necessarily
involved
?
Writers
will
occasionally
write
their
own
headlines
,
but
we
come
up
with
a
list
of
15
or
20
headline
ideas
,
what
we
think
will
make
a
good
story
and
then
we
assign
it
based
upon
what
people
’s
writing
strengths
are
.
We
have
some
people
who
are
great
at
politics
;
some
people
we
give
all
the
war
stuff
to
;
someone
who
is
in
charge
of
the
Britney
Spears
story
of
the
week
—
the
entertainment
stories
.

It
seems
like
some
publications
,
like
AM
New
York
,
always
have
a
Britney
Spears
story
;
is
there
anything
similar
with
The
Onion
where
they
continually
revisit
a
topic
or
person
?
No
,
not
necessarily
.
We
are
a
little
less
reactionary
.
We
tend
to
target
the
zeitgeist
more
than
anything
.
We
’ll
hit
the
mainstream
media
’s
portrayal
of
the
entertainment
world
as
much
as
we
’ll
hit
characters
in
the
entertainment
world
.
We
’ll
attack
People
Magazine
’s
coverage
of
Britney
as
much
as
Britney
.
In
an
interview
with
Terry
Gross
,
Stephen
Colbert
said
of
his
time
at
Second
City
that
they
had
decided
on
not
doing
political
humor
and
,
in
particular
,
hackneyed
political
humor
such
as
Ted
Kennedy
drinking
jokes
.
They
felt
it
was
overdone
,
mean-spirited
and
not
funny
.
Do
your
writers
have
similar
rules
of
thumb
?
We
do
n’t
have
any
rules
or
known
lines
we
wo
n’t
cross
.
We
have
an
understanding
based
upon
having
the
same
writers
in
the
back
room
for
years
,
and
those
writers
training
the
new
writers
as
they
come
in
.
There
is
an
understanding
in
the
room
.
If
it
makes
the
room
laugh
,
it
probably
ends
up
in
the
paper
.
One
example
is
we
ran
an
article
a
couple
of
years
back
that
was
,
"
No
Jennifer
Lopez
News
Today
"
.
That
was
our
reaction
to
all
of
the
J-Lo
stuff
.
We
were
n’t
going
to
touch
on
her
dress
,
or
who
she
was
dating
.
Just
the
fact
that
those
were
the
lead
stories
for
so
many
days
,
in
everything
from
US
Weekly
to
Time
Magazine
.
I
think
it
’s
important
we
have
an
original
take
on
those
things
.
I
think
it
’s
similar
to
what
Colbert
said
to
Terry
Gross
.
We
do
n’t
want
to
just
traffic
in
the
same
24
hour
news
cycle
.
There
’s
a
24
hour
comedy
news
cycle
that
exists
on
all
the
late
night
talk
shows
.
The
Onion
has
a
different
creative
process
where
we
are
not
trying
to
hit
everything
in
the
24
hours
and
on
the
same
notes
.
We
want
an
original
take
.
If
we
choose
to
do
something
on
J-Lo
,
it
’s
going
to
be
something
like
that
,
something
less
obvious
.
When
you
are
going
through
the
headlines
,
is
it
just
you
guys
sitting
around
trying
to
crack
each
other
up
?
It
’s
the
least
amount
of
fun
possible
.
Nah
,
I
’m
kidding
.
It
’s
actually
more
businesslike
than
you
’d
imagine
.
It
’s
very
much
like
you
are
trying
to
make
the
room
laugh
,
but
the
room
has
been
a
sort
of
captive
audience
for
many
many
years
now
,
so
it
takes
a
lot
to
make
the
room
laugh
.
The
best
analogy
I
’ve
heard
is
when
Rob
Siegel
,
former
editor-in-chief
,
likened
it
to
wine
tasting
.
It
’s
this
quiet
experience
where
you
are
trying
to
soak
in
what
the
joke
is
,
have
we
done
anything
like
this
,
is
it
a
unique
take
,
what
are
other
people
doing
.
It
’s
sort
of
like
,
"
Hmmm
...
that
’s
hilarious
.
That
’s
really
really
funny
"
rather
than
people
falling
off
their
chairs
.
It
’s
more
subdued
than
I
think
what
most
people
would
expect
.
It
’s
more
analytical
and
clinical
?
Not
all
the
time
,
but
it
ca
n’t
be
a
laugh
a
minute
.
Yeah
,
what
you
see
on
Studio
60
and
30
Rock
,
those
are
scripted
writers
rooms
.
Everything
is
funny
there
.
There
's
a
lot
of
unfunny
jokes
that
are
told
in
a
back
room
,
that
's
why
they
stay
and
die
in
that
back
room
and
do
n’t
go
out
in
The
Onion
.
If
someone
is
continually
telling
unfunny
jokes
,
do
you
eventually
fire
them
?
That
’s
why
we
are
on
the
10th
floor
to
make
sure
they
die
when
they
get
kicked
out
.
It
can
be
a
real
mess
on
Broadway
.
By
the
time
you
get
to
be
a
writer
for
The
Onion
,
though
,
the
odds
are
you
are
going
to
succeed
because
we
make
it
pretty
challenging
.
You
go
through
quite
a
bit
.
You
will
already
have
demonstrated
a
pretty
long
successful
record
of
writing
stuff
for
us
before
you
will
be
in
that
room
on
a
daily
basis
.
But
if
somebody
wakes
up
one
morning
and
suddenly
no
longer
is
funny
,
then
yeah
,
head
first
,
out
the
door
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
as
sadistically
as
possible
.
Wikinews
interviews
Israeli
mathematician
and
writer
Aner
Shalev
Wednesday
,
September
19
,
2007
Aner
Shalev
is
an
Israeli
mathematician
and
writer
born
in
1958
in
Kibbutz
Kinneret
,
Tiberias
.
Currently
Shalev
is
a
Professor
at
Hebrew
University
of
Jerusalem
's
Einstein
Institute
of
Mathematics
.
At
the
moment
Shalev
is
in
Levico
Terme
,
Trento
,
Italy
for
a
conference
.
He
was
interviewed
by
Wikinews
.
Interview
Aner
Shalev
What
are
you
going
to
talk
about
here
in
Levico
?
I
called
it
Character
,
walks
and
words
.
There
is
a
whole
topic
which
is
called
asymptotic
groups
theory
.
There
are
groups
which
express
the
symmetry
of
some
structures
.
Studying
groups
is
a
bit
like
studying
symmetry
.
It
's
very
beautiful
I
think
.
And
then
when
you
do
it
in
an
asymptotic
way
is
like
you
do
n't
look
at
the
small
details
.
It
's
like
from
the
sky
.
You
look
at
the
general
patterns
.
And
there
is
another
topic
which
is
very
important
in
mathematics
which
is
called
representation
theory
.
So
I
will
mainly
talk
about
how
to
use
a
representation
theory
to
solve
all
kind
of
problems
and
conjectures
in
asymptotic
groups
theory
.
Why
did
you
choose
to
study
mathematics
?
First
of
all
because
it
was
beautiful
.
When
I
was
ten
my
father
already
showed
me
some
stuff
in
mathematics
and
the
beauty
and
the
imagination
was
quite
apparent
.
I
also
like
the
freedom
in
mathematics
.
If
you
study
physics
or
chemistry
then
you
should
describe
the
real
world
.
But
in
mathematics
you
can
build
your
own
structures
.
You
can
walk
in
worlds
created
by
the
imagination
of
people
.
You
're
not
committed
to
the
real
world
.
It
's
almost
like
God
to
some
extent
.
You
can
create
worlds
,
you
can
study
them
.
I
think
it
's
a
combination
of
the
beauty
,
of
the
imagination
,
of
the
freedom
.
Many
people
,
and
many
students
,
dislike
math
.
Why
do
you
think
it
is
so
?
First
of
all
I
think
maybe
they
have
bad
teachers
,
which
is
a
problem
.
You
have
to
have
very
good
teachers
in
mathematics
if
you
really
want
to
enjoy
and
to
succeed
in
it
.
Probably
some
people
mainly
think
about
the
scientific
part
of
it
–
you
have
to
be
accurate
-
and
they
see
less
these
elements
of
the
freedom
,
and
the
imagination
,
and
creation
.
Maybe
they
do
n't
like
the
precise
nature
of
mathematics
.
Also
when
I
talk
mathematics
I
notice
the
language
is
very
important
in
mathematics
and
I
actually
notice
that
many
times
people
fail
in
mathematics
because
they
do
n't
know
how
to
write
a
composition
.
They
have
ideas
but
they
can
not
formulate
them
in
the
right
way
.
Actually
I
find
many
connections
between
mathematics
and
literature
because
almost
all
the
thing
I
told
about
mathematics
are
also
seen
in
literature
and
in
writing
because
when
you
write
you
can
describe
the
real
world
,
but
you
can
also
create
worlds
of
fiction
.
So
you
have
imagination
,
you
have
total
freedom
,
you
can
invent
characters
,
you
can
invent
all
kind
of
development
and
surprises
and
this
kind
of
end
of
story
or
another
.
Also
the
language
is
important
in
writing
and
in
literature
.
So
in
a
way
people
often
do
n't
know
how
to
combine
the
two
fields
.
It
could
look
like
almost
the
opposite
:
literature
is
kind
of
arts
and
mathematics
is
science
but
they
also
see
a
lot
in
common
and
there
where
mathematician
who
were
writers
.
For
example
the
most
famous
is
Lewis
Carrol
,
author
of
Alice
in
Wonderland
.
You
're
not
only
a
mathematician
.
You
also
wrote
two
collections
of
short
stories
and
a
novel
.
Why
did
you
begin
to
write
?
When
I
was
quite
young
I
was
interested
in
psychoanalysis
and
in
dreams
.
I
was
trying
to
interpret
my
dreams
.
I
started
to
write
down
my
dreams
.
And
then
I
noticed
that
I
cheat
a
little
bit
when
I
write
them
down
.
Sometimes
I
make
them
more
pretty
then
they
were
actually
.
So
instead
of
documenting
the
dreams
it
gradually
became
also
like
adding
creational
elements
,
and
I
think
that
somehow
through
writing
my
dreams
I
gradually
came
to
writing
,
also
poems
,
but
mainly
stories
.
I
'm
a
little
bit
inspired
by
dreams
but
when
eventually
I
started
to
write
more
seriously
I
was
more
interested
in
structure
which
also
..
a
bit
like
mathematics
in
a
way
..
for
example
my
first
book
is
called
Opus
1
..
a
collection
of
four
long
stories
with
musical
structures
.
The
first
part
is
called
Legato
and
the
second
part
was
called
Staccato
.
In
the
legato
part
the
sentences
are
very
long
and
without
breaks
almost
like
stream
of
consciousness
.
In
the
staccato
part
it
's
like
a
music
:
a
lot
of
break
,
very
very
short
sentences
.
It
was
a
bit
experimenting
connections
between
the
language
and
the
music
and
the
psychology
of
people
.
In
the
second
book
I
made
another
experiment
.
It
's
a
book
of
opening
,
Overtures
I
called
it
,
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
stories
.
There
are
seventy
beginning
of
stories
without
ends
.
In
the
novel
Dark
Matters
I
think
what
interested
me
in
the
structure
was
two
thing
:
simple
narrative
and
email
.
It
keeps
changing
between
narrative
and
email
.
Another
thing
was
two
different
time
scapes
:
one
goes
very
slow
and
one
goes
very
fast
and
they
almost
kind
of
meet
in
the
end
.
It
's
a
little
bit
like
Achilles
and
the
turtle
.
...
love
story
and
romance
and
surprises
and
tragedies
and
all
this
but
also
this
structure
interested
me
a
lot
.
Why
did
you
choose
this
particular
structure
?
When
I
tell
stories
I
do
n't
like
that
everything
will
be
clear
from
the
beginning
.
I
like
that
something
will
be
a
bit
of
secret
,
or
even
unreliable
narrator
:
someone
tells
something
and
first
you
trust
him
but
then
you
read
more
and
you
become
thrilled
by
everything
.
I
think
by
using
emails
on
the
one
hand
which
are
more
the
voice
of
the
woman
Eva
and
narrative
which
is
more
the
perspective
of
the
man
Adam
,
I
kind
of
confront
them
,
their
different
perspective
and
then
kind
somehow
you
can
see
the
distortions
in
the
way
the
story
is
told
.
I
think
that
in
this
kind
of
structure
there
is
a
very
gradual
clarification
of
the
relationship
and
the
forth
going
on
.

your
eyes
peeled

Andrew
Westphal
about
Stardust
@
home
Sunday
,
May
28
,
2006
Stardust
is
a
NASA
space
capsule
that
collected
samples
from
comet
81P/Wild
(
also
known
as
"
Wild
2
)
in
deep
space
and
landed
back
on
Earth
on
January
15
,
2006
.
It
was
decided
that
a
collaborative
online
review
process
would
be
used
to
"
discover
"
the
microscopically
small
samples
the
capsule
collected
.
The
project
is
called
Stardust
@
home
.
Unlike
distributed
computing
projects
like
SETI
@
home
,
Stardust
@
home
relies
entirely
on
human
intelligence
.
Andrew
Westphal
is
the
director
of
Stardust
@
home
.
Wikinews
interviewed
him
for
May
's
Interview
of
the
Month
(
IOTM
)
on
May
18
,
2006
.
As
always
,
the
interview
was
conducted
on
IRC
,
with
multiple
people
asking
questions
.
Some
may
not
know
exactly
what
Stardust
or
Stardust
@
home
is
.
Can
you
explain
more
about
it
for
us
?
Artist

rendering
of
Spacecraft
Stardust
Image

NASA
Stardust
is
a
NASA
Discovery
mission
that
was
launched
in
1999
.
It
is
really
two
missions
in
one
.
The
primary
science
goal
of
the
mission
was
to
collect
a
sample
from
a
known
primitive
solar-system
body
,
a
comet
called
Wild
2
(
pronounced
"
Vilt-two
"
—
the
discoverer
was
German
,
I
believe
)
.
This
is
the
first
US
"
sample
return
"
mission
since
Apollo
,
and
the
first
ever
from
beyond
the
moon
.
This
gives
a
little
context
.
By
"
sample
return
"
of
course
I
mean
a
mission
that
brings
back
extraterrestrial
material
.
I
should
have
said
above
that
this
is
the
first
"
solid
"
sample
return
mission
—
Genesis
brought
back
a
sample
from
the
Sun
almost
two
years
ago
,
but
Stardust
is
also
bringing
back
the
first
solid
samples
from
the
local
interstellar
medium
—
basically
this
is
a
sample
of
the
Galaxy
.
This
is
absolutely
unprecedented
,
and
we
're
obviously
incredibly
excited
.
I
should
mention
parenthetically
that
there
is
a
fantastic
launch
video
—
taken
from
the
POV
of
the
rocket
on
the
JPL
Stardust
website
—
highly
recommended
—
best
I
've
ever
seen
—
all
the
way
from
the
launch
pad
,
too
.
Basically
interplanetary
trajectory
.
Absolutely
great
.
Is
the
video
available
to
the
public
?
Yes
[
see
below
]
.
OK
,
I
digress
.
The
first
challenge
that
we
have
before
can
do
any
kind
of
analysis
of
these
interstellar
dust
particles
is
simply
to
find
them
.
This
is
a
big
challenge
because
they
are
very
small
(
order
of
micron
in
size
)
and
are
somewhere
(
we
do
n't
know
where
)
on
a
HUGE
collector
—
at
least
on
the
scale
of
the
particle
size
—
about
a
tenth
of
a
square
meter
.
So
...
We
're
right
now
using
an
automated
microscope
that
we
developed
several
years
ago
for
nuclear
astrophysics
work
to
scan
the
collector
in
the
Cosmic
Dust
Lab
in
Building
31
at
Johnson
Space
Center
.
This
is
the
ARES
group
that
handles
returned
samples
(
Moon
Rocks
,
Genesis
chips
,
Meteorites
,
and
Interplanetary
Dust
Particles
collected
by
U2
in
the
stratosphere
)
.
The
microscope
collects
stacks
of
digital
images
of
the
aerogel
collectors
in
the
array
.
These
images
are
sent
to
us
—
we
compress
them
and
convert
them
into
a
format
appropriate
for
Stardust
@
home
.
Stardust
@
home
is
a
highly
distributed
project
using
a
"
Virtual
Microscope
"
that
is
written
in
html
and
javascript
and
runs
on
most
browsers
—
no
downloads
are
required
.
Using
the
Virtual
Microscope
volunteers
can
search
over
the
collector
for
the
tracks
of
the
interstellar
dust
particles
.

How
many
samples
do
you
anticipate
being
found
during
the
course
of
the
project
?
Great
question
.
The
short
answer
is
that
we
do
n't
know
.
The
long
answer
is
a
bit
more
complicated
.
Here
's
what
we
know
.
The
Galileo
and
Ulysses
spacecraft
carried
dust
detectors
onboard
that
Eberhard
Gruen
and
his
colleagues
used
to
first
detect
and
them
measure
the
flux
of
interstellar
dust
particles
streaming
into
the
solar
system
.
(
This
is
a
kind
of
"
wind
"
of
interstellar
dust
,
caused
by
the
fact
that
our
solar
system
is
moving
with
respect
to
the
local
interstellar
medium
.
)
Markus
Landgraf
has
estimated
the
number
of
interstellar
dust
particles
that
should
have
been
captured
by
Stardust
during
two
periods
of
the
"
cruise
"
phase
of
the
interplanetary
orbit
in
which
the
spacecraft
was
moving
with
this
wind
.
He
estimated
that
there
should
be
around
45
particles
,
but
this
number
is
very
uncertain
—
I
would
n't
be
surprised
if
it
is
quite
different
from
that
.
That
was
the
long
answer
!
One
thing
that
I
should
say
...
is
that
like
all
research
,
the
outcome
of
what
we
are
doing
is
highly
uncertain
.
There
is
a
wonderful
quote
attributed
to
Einstein
—
"
If
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
,
it
would
n't
be
called
"
research
"
,
would
it
?
"
How
big
would
the
samples
be
?
We
expect
that
the
particles
will
be
of
order
a
micron
in
size
.
(
A
millionth
of
a
meter
.
)
When
people
are
searching
using
the
virtual
microscope
,
they
will
be
looking
not
for
the
particles
,
but
for
the
tracks
that
the
particles
make
,
which
are
much
larger
—
several
microns
in
diameter
.
Just
yesterday
we
switched
over
to
a
new
site
which
has
a
demo
of
the
VM
(
virtual
microscope
)
I
invite
you
to
check
it
out
.
The
tracks
in
the
demo
are
from
submicron
carbonyl
iron
particles
that
were
shot
into
aerogel
using
a
particle
accelerator
modified
to
accelerate
dust
particles
to
very
high
speeds
,
to
simulate
the
interstellar
dust
impacts
that
we
're
looking
for
.
And
that
's
on
the
main
Stardust

website
[

]
?
Yes
.
Over
900
asylum
seekers
rescued
off
Indonesian
coast
Monday
,
May
18
,
2015
On
Friday
,
fishermen
rescued
over
700
asylum
seekers
whose
boat
sank
,
and
the
Indonesian
Navy
reportedly
saved
200
more
after
they
were
found
swimming
along
the
coast
of
Aceh
,
Indonesia
.
Major
general
Fuad
Basya
,
spokesman
for
the
Indonesian
military
,
said
fisherman
first
noticed
the
people
and
a
warship
was
deployed
to
retrieve
them
.
The
rescued
members
included
Bangladeshis
and
Rohingya
,
a
stateless
minority
of
Muslims
from
Myanmar
.
Myanmar
is
mainly
Buddhist
and
the
United
Nations
rates
the
Rohingya
among
the
world
's
most
persecuted
groups
.
According
to
ABC
News
,
Basya
also
believes
the
asylum
seekers
found
in
the
water
may
have
left
the
boat
on
purpose
to
be
rescued
to
avoid
being
sent
away
from
Indonesia
waters
.
Malaysia
and
Indonesia
have
maintained
a
policy
of
turning
away
boats
of
migrants
which
,
according
to
AFP
,
the
Untied
Nations
and
United
States
have
both
criticised
.
One
Rohingya
,
Muhammad
Amin
,
the
first
boat
rescued
on
Friday
was
turned
around
twice
,
toward
Malaysia
by
Indonesian
navy
and
then
toward
Indonesia
by
Malaysian
navy
.
Discussing
his
concern
in
a
public
statement
,
Malaysia
's
Prime
Minister
,
Najib
Razak
said
,
"
We
are
in
contact
with
all
relevant

had
been
subject

created
greater
awareness
about
this
issue

wishes
to
use
his
newfound

and
attention
to
spotlight
social
causes
including
the
treatment
of

Muslim
Student
Association
president
Sehar
Memon
said
the
large
amount
of
positive

had
helped
make
his
situation
much
better
.
Memon
also
said
she
believed
the
social
movement
in
reaction
to
Mohamed
helped
improve
Muslim
/
non-Muslim
.
Both
the
Irving
Independent
School
District
and
the
Irving
Police
Department
have
asserted
that
the
boy
's
religion
and

were
not
a
factor

manner
in
which
they
approached
the
situation

At

107
killed
in

crane
collapse
Saturday

pilgrims
at
Mecca
's
Grand
Mosque
in
2008
.
A
storm
yesterday
caused
a
crane
to
fall
into
Mecca
's
Grand
Mosque
,
killing
107
or
more
and
wounding
238
,
according
to
Saudi
Arabia
's
Civil
Defense
Authority
.
Civil
Defense
Authority
director
General
Suleiman
al-Amr
,
in
remarks
to
al-Ikhbariya
television
,
said
"
All
those
who
were
wounded
and
the
dead
have
been
taken
to
hospital
.
There
are
no
casualties
left
at
the
location
.
"
The
accident
,
which
occurred
yesterday
afternoon
,
was
caused
by
strong
winds
and
heavy
rain
that
led
the
crane
to
fall
.
Photos
released
of
the
scene
showed
numerous
bloodied
bodies
and
various
scattered
debris
.
The
accident
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
mosque
was
relatively
uncrowded
.
Had
it
happened
an
hour
later
it
would
have
been
much
worse
,
Khaled
Al-Maeena
,
editor
at
large
at
the
Saudi
Gazette
,
said
.
Had
it
happened
five
hours
earlier
or
four
hours
earlier
,
I
think
the
death
toll
would
have
been
more
than
a
thousand
.
The
crane
accident
comes
just
ten
days
before
the
beginning
of
the
Hajj
,
the
annual
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
,
Islam
's
holiest
site
.
As
undergoing
a
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
is
a
mandatory
religious
duty
for
all
Muslims
who
physically
and
financially
can
,
millions
of
pilgrims
arrive
in
Mecca
each
year
for
the
Hajj
.
Construction
was
underway
at
the
mosque
in
order
to
enlarge
the
mosque
and
improve
crowd
control
,
which
has
been
a
recurring
problem
during
Mecca
's
pilgrimages
.

New
Zealand
begins
process
to
consider
changing
national
flag
design
Thursday
,
May
7
,
2015
On
Tuesday
,
the
New
Zealand
government
announced
the
start
of
a
public
process
to
suggest
designs
for
a
new
national
flag
,
and
determine
whether
their
citizens
would
prefer
a
different
national
flag
over
the
current
one
.
The
current
flag
of
New
Zealand
.
The
current
New
Zealand
flag
is
partially
based
on
the
United
Kingdom
's
flag
;
the
new
one
would
be
unique
to
New
Zealand
.
The
government
's
Flag
Consideration
Project
has
planned
a
number
of
conferences
and
roadshows
as
part
of
this
process
,
with
the
first
meeting
set
to
take
place
in
Christchurch
on
May
16
.
According
to
the
New
Zealand
Herald
,
Emeritus
Professor
John
Burrows
,
the
chairman
of
the
project
's
panel
of
twelve
,
said
New
Zealand
's
flag
has
never
before
been
open
to
public
choice
.
Professor
Burrows
also
said
resources
and
kits
would
be
accessible
for
schools
and
communities
,
"
For
example
,
schools
can
run
their
own
flag
discussions
and
referendums
to
mirror
the
formal
process
as
part
of
their
own
learning
exercise
"
.
People
were
encouraged
to
submit
their
designs
online
at
www.flag.govt.nz
and
suggest
what
the
flag
should
mean
on
www.standfor.co.nz
.
Names
of
participants
would
be
engraved
,
at
their
option
,
on
a
flag
pole
monument
to
be
built
in
the
nation
's
capital
,
Wellington
.
New
Zealand
's
Prime
Minister
John
Key
said
he
believes
redesigning
the
flag
now
has
a
"
strong
rationale
"
.
Mr
Key
promoted
the
campaign
for
a
unique
New
Zealand
flag
on
Waitangi
Day
-
February
6
-
this
year
.
Of
the
public
process
,
he
said
,
"
In
the
end
I
'll
have
one
vote
in
each
referendum
just
like
every
other
New
Zealander
on
the
electoral
roll
"
.
The
New
Zealand
government
intends
to
hold
two
referendums
to
reach
a
verdict
on
the
flag
,
at
an
estimated
cost
of
NZ
$
26
million
,
although
a
recent
poll
found
only
a
quarter
of
citizens
favoured
changing
the
flag
.
This
is
a
decrease
from
the
year
before
,
when
it
was
forty
percent
.
The
first
referendum
is
to
be
held
from
November
20
to
December
11
,
selecting
a
single
new
flag
design
out
of
about
four
finalists
.
Voters
would
then
choose
between
the
new
flag
and
their
current
flag
early
in
2016
.

History
"
section
of
the
site
explains
,
in
a
satirical
fashion
,
that
the
incident
was
prompted
by
the
Church
of
Scientology
's
attempts
to
remove
a
promotional
video
featuring
Scientologist
Tom
Cruise
from
YouTube
.
Though
YouTube
is
complying
with
the
Church
of
Scientology
's
requests
to
take
down
the
video
,
other
sites
such
as
Gawker.com
have
stated
that
they
will
keep
hosting
the
video
.
So
far
,
it
's
the
Internet
:
1
,
Scientology
:
0
.
But
it
's
a
long
game

Writing

Matthew
Ingram
of
The
Globe

dubbed
the
ongoing
conflict
involving
the
Church
of
Scientology
's
attempts
to
remove
the
Cruise
video
from
the
Internet
:
"
Scientology
vs.
the
Internet
,
part
XVII
"
.
He
characterized
the
conflict
between
the
Church
of
Scientology
and
anonymous
posters
of
the
Cruise
video
as
"
another
small
skirmish
in
a
war
that
Scientology
has
been
waging
for
almost
15
years
,
since
the
early
days
of
newsgroups
such
as
alt.religion.scientology
,
which
posted
internal
church
documents
in

Microsoft
announced
on

that
it

users
to
move
away
from

On

Microsoft
has
launched
an
aggressive
campaign
to

to
stop
using

update
to
a
newer
IE
.
Its
goal
is
to
decrease
IE6
users
to
less
than
one
percent
.
Its
name
was
Internet

.
Now
that
we

accounted
for

;
this
has
dropped
to
approximately
56
percent
today
.
Mozilla
Firefox
,
its
main
rival
,
has
been
actively
increasing
its
market
share
while
the
recently
released
Google
Chrome
is
also
quickly
gaining
users
.

Web
developers
face
big
problems
with

newer
browsers
with
advanced
web
technology
and
geared
to
the
newest
web
core

,
they
are
forced
to
accommodate
older
out-of-date
technology
to
support

users
.
Also
,
not
mentioned
on

has
277

;
39

of
these
are
rated

Microsoft
says
that
the
latest
versions
of
Internet

provide
the
user
with
enhanced
protection
from
these
attacks

outlived
its

Australian
woman
claims
Church
of
Scientology
imprisoned
her
for
twelve
years
Thursday
,
May
7
,
2015
Valeska
Paris
,
an
Australian
woman
and
former
Scientologist
,
has
claimed
that
the
Church
of
Scientology
imprisoned
her
for
twelve
years
aboard
the
Scientology
-
owned
cruise
ship
,
Freewinds
.
The
Church
of
Scientology
's
cruise
ship
Freewinds
in
Bonaire
.
Paris
was
born
in
Switzerland
but
her
parents
moved
her
to
the
United
Kingdom
when
she
was
six
so
they
could
be
closer
to
the
church
's
headquarters
.
She
joined
the
Sea
Org
aged
14
.
In
1995
,
at
age
seventeen
,
she
was
told
to
disconnect
from
her
mother
.
Paris
claims
she
was
first
sent
to
the
ship
aged
eighteen
for
two
weeks
as
a
teenager
but
ended
up
spending
twelve
years
there
.
Paris
also
claims
that
her
passport
was
taken
away
from
her
and
she
was
forced
to
work
in
the
engine
room
.
I
was
basically
hauled
in
and
told
that
my
mum
had
attacked
the
church
and
that
I
needed
to
disconnect
from
her
because
she
was
suppressive
.
Valeska
Paris
I
was

hauled
in
and
told
that
my
mum
had
attacked
the
church
and
that
I
needed
to
disconnect
from
her
because
she
was
suppressive
.
Her
mother
had
spoken
out
against
Scientology
on
French
television
after
her
ex-husband
and
Paris
's
father
,
Albert
Jaquier
,
committed
suicide
after
he
lost
his
fortune
to
Scientology
.
Paris
claims
that
she
was
kept
at
Flag
Land
Base
in
Clearwater
,
Florida
until
she
was
eighteen
and
then
transferred
to
the
Freewinds
.
On
board
the
Freewinds
,
Paris
claims
that
she
was
working
from
6:00am
to
midnight
and
due
to
lack
of
sleep
ended
up
being
a
walking
zombie
.
She
also
claims
that
in
1997
and
1998
,
she
was
tasked
with
removal
of
asbestos
from
the
ship
.
In
2007
,
Paris
left
the
ship
after
a
confrontation
with
the
ship
's
management
.
She
was
eventually
sent
to
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
in
Sydney
,
which
the
Church
describes
as
a
religious
retreat
,
but
critics
charge
is
a
forced
work
camp
.
Here
,
she
met
her
future
husband
and
subsequently
left
the
church
.
In
a
statement
to
the
Australian
Broadcasting
Corporation
,
the
Church
denied
these
allegations
:
She
certainly
was
n't
'
forced
'
to
be
there
.
She
was
also
never
forced
to
perform
labour
in
the
engine
room
.
They
also
claimed
Paris
was
a
volunteer
and
claim
she
has
a
vested
interest
for
misrepresenting
her
experiences
with
the
Church
.
The
Church
also
claims
that
Paris
not
having
her
passport
was
maritime
procedure
.
North
Korea
puts
military
in
'
quasi-state
of
war
'
Friday

August
21
,
2015
According
to
Yonhap
news
agency
,
quoting
North
Korea
's
main
news
agency
Korean
Central
News
Agency
(
KCNA
)
,
the
country
's
military
has
been
placed
on
high
alert
and
has
been
told
to
prepare
a
"
quasi-state
of
war
"
.
The
report
comes
after
North
and
South
Korea
exchanged
artillery
fire
yesterday
.
They
perpetrated
such
reckless
action
as
firing
36
shells
at
KPA
civil
police
posts
under
the
absurd
pretext
that
the
KPA
fired
one
shell
at
the
south
side
.
Six
shells
of
them
hit
the
area
near
KPA
civil
police
posts
542
and
543
and
other
15
shells
fell
near
KPA
civil
police
posts
250
and
251
"
,
said
KCNA
.
Foolhardy
provocation
deserves
harsh
punishment
,
it
added
;
and
,
later
,
"
Kim
Jong-un
issued
an
order
of
the
supreme
commander
of
the
Korean
People
's
Army
[
KPA
]
that
the
front-line
large
combined
units
of
the
KPA
should
enter
a
wartime
state
to
be
fully
battle
ready
to
launch
surprise
operations
"
.
Yesterday
,
North
Korea
fired
artillery
rounds
aimed
at
a
loudspeaker
in
South
Korea
that
broadcasts
anti-Pyongyang
propaganda
into
the
North
.
Commanders
of
the
Korean
People
's
Army
were
hastily
dispatched
to
the
front-line
troops
to
command
military
operations
to
destroy
psychological
warfare
tools
if
the
enemy
does
not
stop
the
propaganda
broadcast
within
48
hours
and
prepare
against
the
enemy
's
possible
counteractions
,
added
KCNA
.
No
injuries
or
deaths
were
reported
in
the
attacks
from
either
side
,
but
South
Korea
evacuated
about
80
people
in
the
town
of
Yeoncheon
after
at
least
one
shell
landed
near
the
area
.
The
South
retaliated
by
firing
dozens
of
rounds
of
artillery
into
the
north
.
South
Korea
had
recently
started
to
broadcast
propaganda
from
loudspeakers
after
an
11-year
lull
.
The
broadcasts
began
on
August
10
and
South
Korea
says
the
broadcasts
will
continue
.
After
the
exchange
of
fire
,
North
Korea
stated
it
would
attack
any
loudspeakers
broadcasting
propaganda
and
would
respond
,
militarily
,
within
48
hours
if
the
broadcasts
do
not
stop
.
Both
countries
have
put
their
militaries
on
high
levels
of
alert

Lantern
Festival
in
Taipei
lights
up
the
night
Monday
,
March
5
,
2007
Taipei
,
Taiwan
—
The
Taipei
City
Lantern
Festival
was
off
to
a
bright
start
on
Saturday
Night
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
crowded
onto
the
Chiang
Kai
Shek
Memorial
near
downtown
Taipei
to
witness
city
mayor
Hau
Lung-bin
and
other
dignitaries
ceremoniously
flip
the
switch
to
light
hundreds
of
colorful
lantern
scenes
in
and
around
the
240,000
square
meter
memorial
park
.
The
centerpiece
of
this
rock
concert-like
performance
is
a
15
meter
high
rotating
pig
equipped
with
a
fog
machine
,
laser
light
show
and
theme
music
.
The
theme
of
this
years
lantern
festival
revolves
around
the
12
year
Chinese
zodiac
cycles
year
of
the
pig
.
Its
round
shape
symbolizes
wealth
and
good
fortune
and
is
believed
to
bring
good
luck
.
Started
in
1990
,
the
Taipei
lantern
festival
continues
a
2000
year
old
tradition
of
light
related
festivals
marking
the
end
of
the
Chinese
New
Year
celebrations
.
This
particular
event
grows
in
popularity
every
year
.
Last
Year
over
4
million
visitors
attended
the
event
and
this
year
the
city
expects
about
6
million
visitors
according
to
the
event
website
.
Colorful
lantern
scenes
not
only
fill
the
central
square
but
also
the
surrounding
2
km
circumference
of
the
memorial
.
Each
section
has
a
theme
.
One
side
of
the
memorial
is
scenes
made
by
student
groups
while
other
areas
represent
the
counties
of
Taiwan
.
There
is
even
a
section
of
lanterns
sponsored
by
foreign
countries
.
The
Malaysia
Tourism
board
was
quite
prominent
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
grounds
.
As
with
all
new
year
celebrations
in
Taiwan
,
the
lantern
festival
is
crowded
.
People
flock
to
see
the
lantern
scenes
and
enjoy
the
festival
atmosphere
as
they
carry
lanterns
,
given
away
by
the
city
and
bought
from
street
vendors
at
the
event
.
The
many
light
toys
such
a
swords
,
devil
ears
,
and
lanterns
turn
the
milling
crowd
into
a
unique
light
show
that
can
be
observed
by
climbing
the
steps
of
the
70
meter
memorial
hall
on
the
grounds
.
Local
public
transportation
hubs
are
often
swamped
by
the
event
.
The
station
staff
at
Chiang
Kai
Shek
Memorial
Hall
Station
do
an
excellent
job
of
crowd
control
but
lines
for
the
subway
can
still
be
hours
long
and
very
exhausting
.
A
sudden
rain
storm
on
Sunday
night
(
March
4
)
caused
a
mass
exodus
of
people
to
head
for
the
station
prompting
lines
that
backed
up
into
the
street
.
The
commuting
crowds
can
be
avoided
however
by
walking
from
NTU
Hospital
Station
or
Shandao
Station
.
Both
of
these
stops
are
only
about
a
20
minute
walk
from
the
event
and
have
no
crowds
at
all
.
If
you
really
want
to
avoid
the
crowds
,
definitely
avoid
the
weekends
.
Wait
until
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
of
the
festival
when
the
crowds
will
have
dwindled
.
I
visited
the
festival
on
Saturday
night
,
the
opening
night
,
and
there
was
a
sea
of
people
in
the
square
.
I
went
back
the
next
Tuesday
night
and
there
was
almost
no
one
there
,
just
a
few
stray
photographers
taking
advantage
of
the
unimpeded
views
of
the
lanterns
.
The
festival
runs
through
March
11
this
year
.
Hundreds
dead
in
Hajj
stampede
Thursday
,
January
12
,
2006
The
Plains
of
Arafat
on
the
day
of
Hajj
According
to
the
Saudi
Interior
Ministry
over
345
Muslim
pilgrims
have
been
killed
in
a
stampede
during
the
annual
Hajj
pilgrimage
near
Mecca
,
Saudi
Arabia
.
The
stampede
at
Islam
's
most
holy
site
happened
at
Jamarat
Bridge
,
during
an
event
where
pebbles
are
thrown
at
a
pillar
to
represent
the
stoning
of
Satan
as
part
of
the
final
rites
of
the
Hajj
.
The
stampede
began
when
luggage
from
a
bus
tripped
pilgrims
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
wall
,
causing
a
bottleneck
.
Those
who
were
tripped
were
then
crushed
by
the
wave
of
people
behind
them
.
Muslims
are
required
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
during
their
lifetimes
,
if
physically
or
financially
possible
,
as
it
is
one
of
the
five
pillars
of
the

Local
municipalities
in
Italy
ask
taxes
from
religious
schools
Sunday
,
August
2
,
2015
In
the
past
few
days
in
Italy
,
several
municipalities
have
started
asking
religious
schools
to
pay
taxes
for
property
and
local
services
,
despite
the
resistance
of
the
Catholic
Church
.
Instituto
Gonzaga
,
a
catholic
school
in
Milan
.

.
The
request
of
the
municipalities
results
from
the
sentence
of
the
Italian
Supreme
Court
of
Cassation
on
July
8
,
recognising
as
legitimate
the
request
of
the
Municipality
of
Livorno
asking
religious
schools
to
pay
property
taxes
.
Requests
have
come
from
the
Municipality
of
Bogliasco
,
next
to
Genova
,
and
from
the
deputies
of
Movimento
5
Stelle
(
M5S
)
of
the
regional
counsel
of
Lombardy
.
The
first
case
is
of
the
mayor
Luca
Pastorino
that
in
last
years
received
several
refusals
of
his
requests
for
payment
because
of
the
religious
nursery
school
and
retirement
home
.
In
the
second
case
,
the
M5S
party
asks
to
the
regional
government
to
assure
the
local
administrations
of
the
region
regularly
apply
the
sentence
of
the
Supreme
Court
.
The
case
on
which
the
Court
has
ruled
was
of
the
religious
schools
Santo
Spirito
and
Immacolata
in
Livorno
,
Tuscany
,
to
pay
over
422,000
euros
in
arrears
for
the
period
from
2004
to
2009
.
The
request
was
advanced
by
the
Municipality
of
Livorno
in
2010
.
The
city
reasoned
,
"
because
the
users
of
the
private
schools
pay
a
frequency
fee
,
this
kind
of
activity
is
considered
as
a
commercial
one
"
(
(
it
)
)
.
In
2014
the
Italian
municipal
tax
discipline
has
changed
from
the
ICI
system
to
the
IMU
system
by
the
Monti
government
.
A
mean
cost
per
student
criterion
is
used
to
tax
only
the
schools
that
receive
a
fee
higher
than
the
mean
cost
per
student
fixed
by
the
State
.
The
new
law
is
not
retroactive
,
so
the
taxes
requested
in
arrears
from
2006
to
2009
are
under
the
ICI
system
.
Minister
of
Education
Stefania
Giannini
said
a
"
more
general
reflection
"
(
(
it
)
)
is
needed
.
Claudio
De
Vincenti
,
undersecretary
to
the
prime
minister
,
said
"
a
discussion
table
will
be
opened
with
the
non-profit
associations
,
religious
association
included
"
(
(
it
)
)
.
Undersecretary
for
Education
Mr.
Toccafondi
says
"
many
schools
will
increase
their
fees
or
they
will
quit
.
Then
the
State
will
have
to
find
new
resources
to
build
new
structures
and
manage
them
"
(
(
it
)
)
.
Also
the
president
of
the
Lombardy
region
,
Roberto
Maroni
,
has
reacted
by
proposing
some
regional
counter-measures
to
finance
private
schools
.
The
secretary
general
of
CEI
(
Italian
Episcopal
Conference
)
,
Nunzio
Galantino
,
has
called
the
sentence
"
dangerous
"
(
(
it
)
)
and
"
ideological
"
(
(
it
)
)
:
Who
takes
the
decisions
,
do
it
with
less
ideology
.
Because
I
have
the
clear
sensation
that
with
this
way
of
thinking
,
they
wait
the
praise
of
some
ideologized
supporters
.
Indeed
,
they
do
n't
understand
what
kind
of
good
service
private
schools
held
"
(
(
it
)
)
.
Italian
secularist
associations
are
concerned
the
Government
will
modify
the
law
in
order
to
maintain
an
exception
for
religious
schools
.
The
secularist
magazine
MicroMega
describe
the
court
's
judgement
as
historic
.
The
Union
of
Rationalist
Atheists
and
Agnostics
(
UAAR
)
has
launched
a
petition
which
now
has
more
than
11,000
signatures
,
asking
the
government
to
respect
and
execute
the
sentence
of
the
Supreme
Court
.
It
is
also
encouraging
citizens
to
ask
for
application
of
the
law
in
their
local
municipalities
.

This
past
week
marked
the
opening
night
of
an
Andy
Warhol
exhibit
at
the
University
of
Southern
Indiana
.
USI
's
art

,
like
189
other
educational
galleries
and
museums
around
the
country
,
is
a
recipient
of
a
major
Warhol
donor
program
,
and
this
program
is
cultivating
new
interest
in
Warhol
's
photographic
legacy
.
Wikinews
reporters
attended
the
opening
and
spoke
to
donors
,
exhibit
organizers
and
patrons
.
The
USI
art
gallery
celebrated
the
Thursday
opening
with
its
display
of
Warhol
's
Polaroids
,
gelatin
silver
prints
and
several
colored

The

Art
Center
/
Pace
Galleries
at
USI
bases
its
exhibit
around
roughly
100
Polaroids
selected
from
its
collection
.
The
Polaroids
were
all
donated
by
the
Andy
Warhol
Photographic
Legacy
Program
,
according
to
Kristen
Wilkins
,
assistant
professor
of
photography
and
curator
of
the
exhibit
.
The
Andy
Warhol
Foundation
for
the
Visual
Arts
made
two
donations
to
USI
Art
Collections
,
in
2007
and
a
second
recently
.
Kathryn
Waters
,
director
of
the
gallery
,
expressed
interest
in
further
donations
from
the
foundation
in
the
future
.
Since
2007
the
Andy
Warhol
Photographic
Legacy
Program
has
seeded
university
art
galleries
throughout
the
United
States
with
over
28,000
Andy
Warhol
photographs
and
other
artifacts
.
The
program
takes
a
decentralized
approach
to
Warhol
's
photography
collection
and
encourages
university
art
galleries
to
regularly
disseminate
and
educate
audiences
about
Warhol
's
artistic
vision
,
especially
in
the
area
of
photography

Wilkins
observed
that
the
2007
starting
date
of
the
donation
program
,
which
is
part
of
the
Andy
Warhol
Foundation
for
the
Visual
Arts
,
coincided
with
the
20th
anniversary
of
Andy
Warhol
's
death
in
1987
.
USI
was
not
alone
in
receiving
a
donation
.
K.C.
Maurer
,
chief
financial
officer
and
treasurer
at
the
Andy
Warhol
Foundation
,
said
500
institutions
received
the
initial
invitation
and
currently
190
universities
have
accepted
one
or
more
donations
.
Institutional
recipients
,
said
Mauer
,
are
required
to
exhibit
their
donated
Warhol
photographs
every
ten
years
as
one
stipulation
.
While
USI
is
holding
its
exhibit
,
there
are
also
Warhol
Polaroid
exhibits
at
the
Tang
Teaching
Museum
and
Art
Gallery
at
Skidmore
College
in
Saratoga
Springs
,
New
York
and
an
Edward
Steichen
and
Andy
Warhol
exhibit
at
the
Mary
&
Leigh
Block
Museum
of
Art
at
Northwestern
University
in
Evanston
,
Illinois
.
All
have
received
Polaroids
from
the
foundation
.
University
exhibits
can
reach
out
and
attract
large
audiences
.
For
example
,
the
Weatherspoon
Art
Museum
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Greensboro
saw
attendance
levels
reach
11,000
visitors
when
it
exhibited
its
Warhol
collection
in
2010
,
according
to
curator
Elaine
Gustafon
.
That
exhibit
was
part
of
a
collaboration
combining
the
collections
from
Duke
University
,
located
in
Durham
,
North
Carolina
,
and
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
,
which
also
were
recipients
of
donated
items
from
the
Andy
Warhol
Photographic
Legacy
Program
.
Superstars
Each
collection
donated
by
the
Andy
Warhol
Photographic
Legacy
Program
holds
Polaroids
of
well-known
celebrities
.
The
successful
UNC
Greensboro
exhibit
included
Polaroids
of
author
Truman
Capote
and
singer-songwriter
Carly
Simon
.
I
think
America
's
obsession
with
celebrity
culture
is
as
strong
today
as
it
was
when
Warhol
was
living
,
said
Gustafon
.
People
are
still
intrigued
by
how
stars
live
,
dress
and
socialize
,
since
it
is
so
different
from
most
people
's
every
day
lives
.
Wilkins
explained
Warhol
's
obsession
with
celebrities
began
when
he
first
collected
head
shots
as
a
kid
and
continued
as
a
passion
throughout
his
life
.
He
's
hanging
out
with
the
celebrities
,
and
has
kind
of
become
the
same
sort
of
celebrity
he
was
interested
in
documenting
earlier
in
his
career
,
Wilkins
said
.
The
exhibit
at
USI
includes
Polaroids
of
actor
Dennis
Hopper
;
musician
Nick
Rhodes
of
Duran

;
publishers
Jann
Wenner

.
Wikinews
observed
the
USI
exhibit
identifies
and
features
Polaroids
of
fashion
designer
Halston
,
a
former
resident
of
Evansville
.
University
collections
across
the
United
States
also
include
Polaroids
of
"
unknowns
"
who
have
not
yet
had
their
fifteen
minutes
of
fame
.
Cynthia
Thompson
,
curator
and
director
of
exhibits
at
the
University
of
Arkansas
,
Fayetteville
,
said
,
"
These
images
serve
as
documentation
of
people
in
his
every
day
life
and
art
-
one
which
many
of
us
enjoy
a
glimpse
into
.
"
Warhol
's
photographic
legacy
Warhol
was
close
to
important
touchstones
of
the
1960s
,
including
art
,
music
,
consumer
culture
,
fashion
,
and
celebrity
worship
,
which
were
all
buzzwords
and
images
Wikinews
observed
at
USI
's
opening
exhibit
.
He
was
also
an
influential
figure
in
the
pop
art
movement
.
Pop
art
was
about
what
popular
American
culture
really
thought
was
important
,
Kathryn
Waters
said
.
So
even
back
in
the
sixties
,
he
was
very
aware
of
this
part
of
our
culture
.
Which
as
we
all
know
in
2014
,
has
only
increased
probably
a
thousand
fold
.
"
I
think
everybody
knows
Andy
Warhol
's
name
,
even
non-art
people
,
that
's
a
name
they
might
know
because
he
was
such
a
personality
,
Water
said
.
Hilary
Braysmith
,
USI
associate
professor
of
art
history
,
said
,
"
I
think
his
photography
is
equally
influential
as
his
graphic
works
,
his
more
famous
pictures
of
Marilyn
.
In
terms
of
the
evolution
of
photography
and
experimentation
,
like
painting
on
them
or
the
celebrity
fascination
,
I
think
he
was
really
ground-breaking
in
that
regard
.
"
The
Polaroid
format
is
not
what
made
Warhol
famous
,
however
,
he
is
in
the
company
of
other
well-known
photographers
who
used
the
camera
,
such
as
Ansel
Adams
,
Chuck
Close
,
Walker
Evans
,
Robert
Mapplethorpe
,
and
Helmut
Newton
.
Wilkins
said
,
"
[
Warhol
]
liked
the
way
photo
booths
and
the
Polaroid
's
front
flash
looked
"
.
She
explained
how
Warhol
's
adoption
of
the
Polaroid
camera
revealed
his
process
.
According
to
Wilkins
,
Warhol
was
able
to
reproduce
the
Polaroid
photograph
and
create
an
enlargement
of
it
,
which
he
then
could
use
to
commit
the
image
to
the
silk
screen
medium
by
applying
paint
or
manipulating
them
further
.
One
of
the
silk
screens
exhibited
at
USI
this
time
was
the
Annie
Oakley
screen
print
called
"
Cowboys
and
Indians
"
from
1987
.
Wilkins
also
said
Warhol
was
both
an
artist
and
a
businessperson
.
It
was
a
very
practical
salesman
approach
to
his
work
.
He
was
very
prolific
but
very
business
minded
about
that
.
"
He
wanted
to
be
rich
and
famous
and
he
made
lots
of
choices
to
go
that
way
,
Wilkins
said
.
USI
exhibit
Kiara
Perkins
,
a
second
year
USI
art
major
,
admitted
she
was
willing
to
skip
class
Thursday
night
to
attend
the
opening
exhibit
but
then
circumstances
allowed
for
her
to
attend
the
exhibit
.
Why
did
she
so
badly
want
to
attend
?
He
is
a
legend
.
"
For
Kevin
Allton
,
a
USI
instructor
in
English
,
Warhol
was
also
a
legend
.
He
said
,
"
Andy
Warhol
was
the
center
of
the
Zeitgeist
for
the
20th
century
and
everything
since
.
He
is
a
post-modern
diety
.
"
Allton
said
he
had
only
seen
the
Silver
Clouds
installation
before
in
film
.
The
Silver
Clouds
installation
were
silver
balloons
blown
up
with
helium
,
and
those
balloons
filled
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
in
the
gallery
.
I
thought
that
in
real
life
it
was
really
kind
of
magical
,
Allton
said
.
I
smacked
them
around
.
Elements
of
the
Zeitgeist
were
also
playfully
recreated
on
USI
's
opening
night
.
In
her
opening
remarks
for
attendees
,
Waters
pointed
out
those
features
to
attendees
,
noting
the
touches
of
the
Warhol
Factory
,
or
the
studio
where
he
worked
,
that
were
present
around
them
.
She
pointed
to
the
refreshment
table
with
Campbell
's
Soup
served
with
"
electric
"
Kool
Aid
and
tables
adorned
with
colorful
gumball
"
pills
"
.
The
music
in
the
background
was
from
such
bands
as
The
Velvet
Underground
.
The
big
hit
of
the
evening
,
Wikinews
observed
from
the
long
line
,
was
the
Polaroid-room
where
attendees
could
wear
a
Warhol-like
wig
or
don
crazy
glasses
and
have
their
own
Polaroid
taken
.
The
Polaroids
were
ready
in
an
instant
and
immediately
displayed
at
the
entry
of
the
exhibit
.
Exhibit
goers
then
became
part
of
the
very
exhibit
they
had
wanted
to
attend
.
In
fact
,
many
people
Wikinews
observed
took
out
their
mobiles
as
they
left
for
the
evening
and
used
their
own
phone
cameras
to
make
one
further
record
of
the
moment
-
a
photo
of
a
photo
.
Perhaps
they
had
learned
an
important
lesson
from
the
Warhol
exhibit
that
cultural
events
like
these
were
ripe
for
use
and
reuse
.
We
might
even
call
these
exit
instant
snap
shots
,
the
self
selfie
.

security
,
in
all
cases
examined
.
Several
scenarios
were
considered
because
of
uncertainty
of
future
levels
of
ozone
pollution
.
They
estimated
by
2050
,
increasing
population
and
changing
diet
would
increase
world
food
needs
by
50
percent
.
As
coauthor
Colette
Heald
told
The
Huffington
Post
,
"
The
climate
projections
are
quite
consistent
[...]
the
future
of
ozone
pollution
is
very
different
[...]
leading
to
either
offsetting
or
reinforcing
effects
[
of
climate
change
]
on
crops
"
.
By
2050
,
undernourishment
would
increase
by
either
49
percent
or
by
27
percent
,
depending
on
the
scenario
.
The
study
focuses
on
ozone-temperature
covariation
:
ground-level
ozone
increases
with
temperatures
.
Heald
said
although
temperature
and
ozone
are
separately
known
to
impact
crop
yields
,
"
nobody
has
looked
at
these
together
"
.
Depending
on
region
and
crops
,
the
yields
may
be
primarily
sensitive
to
ozone
-
in
the
case
of
wheat
-
or
heat
-
in
the
case
of
maize
-
alone
,
providing
a
local
estimation
of
relative
benefits
of
climate
change
adaptation
versus
ozone
regulation
.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
notes
,
"
Ground-level
ozone
causes
more
damage
to
plants
than
all
other
air
pollutants
combined
"
,
highlighting
the
importance
of
air
quality
for
agriculture
.
Results
of
NCLAN
studies
,
published
in
a
paper
by
AS
Heagle
in
1989
,
show
dicot
species
,
such
as
soybean
,
cotton
,
and
peanut
,
lose
more
yield
from
ozone
than
do
monocot
species
such
as
sorghum
,
field
corn
,
and
winter
wheat
.
The
researchers
found
that
ozone
pollution
caused
46
percent
of
previously
heat-attributed
damage
to
soybean
crops
.
The
model
does
not
include
the
effect
of
rising
carbon
dioxide
concentration
,
which
has
complex
and
potentially
offsetting
impacts
on
global
food
supply
.
The
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
says
some
crops
may
have
higher
yields
with
increased
levels
of
carbon
dioxide
.
However
,
global
warming
also
increases
probability
of
extreme
crops-damaging
weather
events
such
as
floods
,
droughts
,
and
extreme
temperatures
.
Climate
change
affects
distribution
of
weeds
,
pests
,
and
diseases
.
Heald
noted
the
findings
show
pollution
reduction
is
also
important
.
Ozone
is
something
that
we
understand
the
causes
of
,
and
the
steps
that
need
to
be
taken
to
improve
air
quality
.
"
As
Heald
told
The
Huffington
Post
,
US
surface
ozone
has
dropped
partly
due
to
the
Clean
Air
Act
.
However
,
the
future
of
ozone
air
quality
in
the
U.S.
and
around
the
world
will
depend
on
local
emissions
,
the
use
of
pollution
control
technology
,
regulations
,
and
air
quality
policy
.

Greek
court
rules
worship
of
ancient
Greek
deities
is
legal
Monday
,
March
27
,
2006
Greek
court
has
ruled
that
worshippers
of
the
ancient
Greek
religion
may
now
formally
associate
and
worship
at
archeological
sites
.
Prior
to
the
ruling
,
the
religion
was
banned
from
conducting
public
worship
at
archeological
sites
by
the
Greek
Ministry
of
Culture
.
Due
to
that
,
the
religion
was
relatively
secretive
.
The
Greek
Orthodox
Church
,
a
Christian
denomination
,
is
extremely
critical
of
worshippers
of
the
ancient
deities
.
Today
,
about
100,000
Greeks
worship
the
ancient
gods
,
such
as
Zeus
,
Hera
,
Poseidon
,
Aphrodite
,
and
Athena
.
The
Greek
Orthodox
Church
estimates
that
number
is
closer
to
40,000
.
Many
neo-pagan
religions
,
such
as
Wicca
,
use
aspects
of
ancient
Greek
religions
in
their
practice
;
Hellenic
polytheism
instead
focuses
exclusively
on
the
ancient
religions
,
as
far
as
the
fragmentary
nature
of
the
surviving
source
material
allows
.
The
Chatham
Islands
The
Chatnam
Islands
(
Rekohu
in
the
indigenous
Moriori
language
)
are
the
eastern-most
settled
islands
in
New
Zealand
.
The
islands
are
in
their
own
time
zone
,
45
minutes
ahead
of
New
Zealand
time
;
the
International
Date
Line
jogs
eastward
to
keep
them
on
the
same
calendar
day
as
the
rest
of
New
Zealand
.
The
islands
lie
860
km
east
of
Christchurch
,
in
the
middle
of
the
"
Roaring
Forties
"
.
Steeped
in
culture
and
history
,
these
islands
are
on
the
very
edge
of
civilisation
.

Understand
The
Chatham
Islands
consist
of
the
main
island
,
Chatham
Island
itself
,
with
a
population
of
600
,
smaller
Pitt
Island
with
about
40
inhabitants
,
and
a
number
of
rocky
outcrops
.
The
islands
are
volcanic
in
origin
and
have
a
unique
and
sensitive
habitat
that
supports
many
rare
and
endangered
species
.
The
original
people
of
the
islands
are
the
Moriori
,
who
were
descended
from
the
Maori
of
mainland
New
Zealand
,
but
who
developed
their
own
culture
and
variant
of
the
language
.
In
1835
Maori
settlers
from
the
mainland
arrived
,
massacred
and
enslaved
the
Moriori
.
Get
in
By
plane
The
only
way
for
visitors
to
travel
to
the
Chathams
is
via
scheduled
or
chartered
air
service
.
Air
Chathams
fly
5
days
per
week
,
from
either
Christchurch
,
Auckland
or
Wellington
and
,
seasonally
,
from
Napier
.
The
plane
is
based
in
the
Chathams
and
flies
to
mainland
New
Zealand
in
the
morning
,
then
back
to
the
Chathams
in
the
afternoon
.
As
part
of
New
Zealand
,
there
are
no
passport
or
visa
requirements
and
no
border
controls
on
arrival
from
the
mainland
.
You
should
book
or
ensure
accommodation
before
you
board
a
flight
for
the
Chathams
,
as
during
the
popular
months
of
the
tourism
season
,
between
October
and
April
,
accommodation
can
be
severely
limited
.
There
are
no
same-day
return
flights
,
so
once
there
you
have
to
stay
at
least
one
night
.
Although
flying
to
the
Chathams
and
back
is
not
cheap
,
it
is
worth
it
.
Even
the
mainland
school
groups
that
fly
there
for
school
camps
,
and
choose
to
stay
at
Kopinga
Marae
[
1
]
get
value
for
money
by
chartering
a
flight
one
way
.
Anyway
,
you
do
n't
have
a
choice
on
how
you
get
there
,
unless
you
happen
to
own
an
aeroplane
.
However
,
when
you
get
off
that
aeroplane
,
if
you
have
n't
pre-organised
transport
,
you
will
have
to
walk
,
and
it
is
a
long
way
into
town
.
By
boat
The
only
scheduled
shipping
service
to
the
Chatham
Islands
remains
the
Black
Robin
Freighters
"
Rangatira
"
,
an
antiquated
,
slow
and
small
coastal
trading
vessel
.
This
boat
has
serviced
the
islands
for
many
years
,
but
does
not
carry
passengers
.
Freight
charges
on
the
Rangatira
appear
to
be
flexible
and
subject
to
change
.
Vessels
can
call
at
the
Chathams
and
there
are
a
number
of
"
safe
"
harbours
for
shelter
if
the
need
arises
.
Remember
to
notify
the
local
policeman
,
or
Ministry
of
Fisheries
officer
if
you
are
entering
New
Zealand
via
the
Chathams
.
If
you
want
a
wharf
berthage
then
call
the
local
harbour
master
as
you
near
the
Chathams
and
he
will
sort
you
out
.
Get
around
There
are
several
businesses
on
Chatham
Island
that
will
rent
you
a
vehicle
.
Do
not
expect
the
flashest
and
latest
in
rental
cars
though
.
The
cars
"
will
"
be
warranted
and
safe
,
but
they
wo
n't
be
exceptionally
"
flash
"
.
Chatham
Motors
have
a
range
of
nice
rental
vans
available
as
well
and
they
provide
pretty
good
service
for
both
visitors
and
locals
.

Understand
Cleveland
from
lakefront
.
Cleveland
is
the
urban
center
of
Northeast
Ohio
,
the
15th
largest
combined
metropolitan
area
in
the
United
States
.
Throughout
the
twentieth
century
,
the
City
of
Cleveland
proper
was
ranked
as
one
of
the
10
largest
cities
in
the
U.S.
(
from
1890
until
1970
per
US
Census
Bureau
statistics
)
.
Like
most
U.S.
cities
,
Cleveland
proper
began
to
lose
population
to
suburban
areas
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
.
However
,
in
the
mid-1980s
,
Cleveland
earned
the
nickname
the
"
Comeback
City
"
as
the
urban
core
experienced
a
dramatic
revitalization
process
that
continues
today
.
As
its
"
comeback
"
has
continued
,
the
official
moniker
is
now
the
New
American
City
as
Cleveland
has
rightfully
earned
the
reputation
as
a
model
of
effective
public-private
partnership
for
urban
planning
.
Despite
the
common
perception
that
Cleveland
is
an
industrial
town
,
just
beyond
the
automotive
and
steel
plants
,
a
clean
and
beautiful
downtown
rises
at
the
mouth
of
the
Cuyahoga
River
on
the
southern
shore
of
Lake
Erie
(
often
marvelled
over
by
visitors
who
are
surprised
you
ca
n't
see
the
other
side
,
i.e.
,
Canada
)
.
Like
other
cities
in
the
so-called
"
rust
belt
“
,
Cleveland
has
endured
growing
pains
as
it
makes
its
transition
from
a
manufacturing-based
economy
.
While
Cleveland
continues
to
play
a
leading
role
in
building
the
U.S.
industrial
base
,
it
has
also
developed
economic
prowess
in
the
fields
of
health
care
,
law
,
finance
,
insurance
,
real
estate
development
,
and
professional
services

Another
thing
non-locals
do
n't
often
realize
is
that
Cleveland
's
long
history
of
industrial
wealth
has
left
it
chock
full
of
cultural
riches
as
well
as
the
beginnings
of
a
"
sustainable
city
"
movement
.

as

,

has
been

Visa
and

A
tourist
visa
card
(
visa

is
necessary
for
travelers
from
most
nations
.
This
visa
,
which
is
really
little
more
than
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
you

costs
between
15
-
25
CUC
(
or

,
depending
on
where
purchased
.
It
can
be
purchased
at
the
Airport
in
Cuba
on
arrival
,
however
it
should
be
noted
that
many
airlines
will
require
a

visa
card
before
boarding
flights
.
It
is
usually
valid
for
30
days
and
can
be
extended
once
for
another
30
days
at
any
immigration
office
in
Cuba
(
for
25

)
-
beyond
this
you
would
need
a
flight

Canadians
are
the
exception
,
getting
90
days
on
arrival

that
if
departing
from
Europe
(
this
may
apply
to
other
countries

,
you
will
require
to
have
the
visa
before
boarding
the
plane
.
Some
times
,
the
airline
provides
these
at
the
airport
,
however
check
first
that
this
is
the
case
.
Without
a
valid
visa
,
boarding
will

Country-specific
advise
UK
:
Applying
for
the
visa
is
a
very
simple
process
and
can
be
done
by
post
or
in
person
at
the
Cuban
embassy
in
London
.
When
applying
to
the
Cuban
Consulate
by
post
,
there
is
a
new
charge
introduced
in
2011
which
is
a
£
25
for
a
non-personal
transaction
.
If
you
cannot
go
to
the
Cuban
Consulate
you
may
consider
using
VisaCuba
(
[

]
)
because
it
may
be
cheaper
.
Through
them
it
may
cost
£
20
in
total
per
person
.
If
you
apply
in
person
to
the
Cuban
Consulate
,
you
get
the
visa
straight
away
.
It
can
also
be
done
through
online
agencies
as
mentioned
before

they
may
be
slightly
more
expensive
(
normally
£
15

Fort
Lee
Fort
Lee
is
a
city
in
Bergen
County
.
View
of
the
George
Washington
Bridge
's
long
span
and
Manhattan
,
as
seen
while
looking
east
from
Fort
Lee
Historic
Park
Understand
Fort
Lee
is
located
between
the
Paramus
,
NJ
retail
corridor
and
Upper
Manhattan
.
This
town
is
comprised
of
a
large
residential
community
that
includes
Fort
Lee
natives
,
transplants
from
New
York
,
and
immigrants
,
especially
from
Korea
.
This
cultural
diversity
is
represented
through
the
vast
variety
of
international
restaurants
and
small
business
,
and
in
particular
,
there
is
a
strong
Korean
presence
that
can
be
seen
in
retail
and
dining
storefronts
.
Fort
Lee
is
a
small
town
but
is
piled
high
with
apartment
buildings
.
Because
Fort
Lee
is
situated
above
the
banks
of
the
Hudson
River
,
there
are
breathtaking
views
from
almost
any
window
facing
the
river
.
The
New
York
City
skyline
and
4th
of
July
fireworks
are
spectacular
over
the
river
.
Although
it
is
highly
built
up
,
Fort
Lee
also
houses
many
playing
fields
and
recreational
parks
as
well
as
bike
and
running
trails
.
And
although
there
is
a
great
deal
of
vehicle
traffic
to
and
from
the
George
Washington
Bridge
,
which
connects
Fort
Lee
with
Manhattan
,
one
of
the
largest
perks
of
this
town
is
the
walking
access
to
many
restaurants
,
convenience
stores
and
mass
transit
,
in
the
form
of
buses
and
vans
that
frequently
run
across
the
bridge
and
up
and
down
major
streets
.

If
coming
from
New

City
,
take
the

Fort

is
the

town
on
the
New

Station
on

whether
s/he
can
let
you
off
in
Fort

.
By

Fort
Lee
can
also
be
accessed
by
boat
or

from

meet
in
Fort
Lee
,
as
the
Good
Shepherd
Episcopalian
Church
is
dwarfed
by
a
residential
highrise
immediately
behind
it
Most
people
choose
cars
,
but
if
headed
to
a
central
area
,
such
as
Main
Street
,
it
is
best
to
drive
there
,
park
in
a
municipal
parking
lot
,
and
walk
around
from
there
.
Since
so
much
of
the
town
’s
retail
area
is
clustered
in
3
or
4
block
radius
,
it
would
be
beneficial
to
walk
around
,
but
might
also
be
dangerous
given
the
high
traffic
intersections
.
If
walking
use
caution
,
and
if
parking
,
make
sure
to
feed
the
meter
with
plenty
of
pocket
change
;
the

maids
take
their
job
very
seriously
.
Since
fort
lee
is
situated
in
such
a
convenient
area
for
those
commuting
to
and
from
the
city
,
there
is
often
high
traffic
and
congestion
on
the
roads
.
If
you
are
planning
on
being
somewhere
at
a
certain
time
,
one
might
suggest
leaving
a
good
10
to
15
minutes
to
escape
local
traffic
before
hitting
any
major
roadways
.
For
local
transportation

Other

Do

Falls
)
.
Some
are
within
5

10
minutes
walking

,
some
require
at
least
3
–
4
hours
of
hiking
(
those
are
,
of
course
less
frequented
by
other
tourists

you
might
find
yourself
alone

-
an
amazing
experience
!

.
The
local
rum
distilleries
offer
tours
(
check
for
opening
times
as
they
may
very
from
season
to
season
)
which
are
certainly
worth
the
while
since
rum
production
is
a
very
integral
part
of
Guadeloupe
's
economy
.
And
sampling
the
local
rums
is
definitely
worth
the
while
.
Even
though
they
might
not
be
the
best
way
to
get
around
the
island
,
a
ride
on
the
bus
is
still
an
experience
you
should
not
miss
.
Cheap

is
Poland
's
third

capital
of
the
Łódzkie
Voivodship
.
Unlike
most
other
large
Polish
cities
,
which
have
long
histories
,
Łódź
was
created
almost
from

during
the
19th
century
textile
industry
boom
to
house
textile
mills
,
their
owners

In

,
Łódź
has

and

industries
.
Owing
to
its
history
,
Łódź
has
an
impressive
collection
of
residential
,
commercial
and
industrial
19th-century
architecture
including
some
of
Europe
's
largest
factory
buildings
,
now
mostly
repurposed
as
shopping
centres
or
lofts
.
Recent
local
investment
and
a
long-standing
cultural
scene
ensures
there
is
always
something
more
to
do
than
just
sightseeing
or
shopping
,
with
the
city
hosting
some
of
the
best
museums
and
art
galleries
in
the
country
.
The
close
proximity
of
Warsaw
and
Łódź
's
location
at
the
crossroads
of
the
Polish
motorway
system
make
it
an
ideal
destination
for
a
day
trip
or
longer
city
break

Name
and
history
The
origin
of
the
city
's
name
is
unknown
,
however
,
the
word
łódź
translates
to
"
boat
"
in
English
.
This
is
referred
to
in
the
emblem
and
when
you
hear
the
dwellers
of
Łódź
(
łodzianin
(
man
)
łodzianka
(
woman
)
łodzianie
(
plural
)
)
calling
themselves
"
the
boat
people
"
.
A
settlement
on
the
area
of
present-day
Łódź
was
established
in
the
14th
century
and
in
1423
it
was
granted
a
town
charter
,
along
with
the
right
to
have
a
marketplace
.
However
,
the
real
development
of
Łódź
started
with
the
industrial
era
at
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century
when
the
city
was
chosen
to
be
the
heart
of
the
rapidly-growing
textile
industry
.
The
population
of
Łódź
soared
from
some
4,000
people
in
the
1830s
and
40,000
in
1865
to
over
300,000
inhabitants
at
the
turn
of
the
century
,
which
was
an
unprecedented
growth
on
a
worldwide
scale
.
The
rapid
development
of
Łódź
in
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
was
brought
about
by
the
rise
of
enormous
industrialist
fortunes
.
New
inhabitants
,
craftsmen
and
merchants
came
to
Łódź
;
markets
and
town
fairs
came
to
life
.
The
profits
obtained
from
prosperous
textile
mills
opened
up
practically
unlimited
possibilities
for
their
owners
.
The
city
residences
became
expressions
of
the
riches
and
power
of
the
local
tycoons
.
They
were
usually
situated
next
to
the
owner
's
factory
.
Ever
since
the
industrial
revolution
brought
a
massive
influx
of
workforce
,
Łódź
had
been
a
city
almost
equally
divided
between
four
cultures
-
Polish
,
Jewish
,
German
and
Russian
.
The
day
before
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
,
Łódź
was
inhabited
by
approximately
672,000
people
,
among
whom
35
%
were
of
Jewish
faith
and
some
15
%
were
ethnic
German
.
Andrzej
Wajda
's
movie
,
Promised
Land
based
on
a
novel
by
the
Nobel
laureate
Władysław
Reymont
,
depicts
those
times
and
is
a
worthwhile
introduction
to
the
city
's
bustling
history
.
During
the
Nazi
occupation
,
Łódź
was
incorporated
directly
into
the
Third
Reich
.
The
city
was
renamed
to
Litzmannstadt
,
and
Piotrkowska
Street
was
called
Adolf-Hitler-Strasse
.
The
Jewish
community
was
practically
wiped
out
,
and
many
others
lost
their
lives
.
Although
the
city
was
not
destroyed
in
the
aftermath
,
the
material
losses
were
serious
as
the
machinery
,
raw
materials
and
finished
goods
were
taken
away
by
the
fleeing
Nazis
.
The
day
before
the
liberation
,
about
80,000
Germans
left
Łódź
in
panic
.
At
the
beginning
of
1945
,
the
population
was
estimated
at
300,000
.
Plac
Wolności
Łódź
today
Since
the
fall
of
communism
in
Poland
,
Łódź
has
not
enjoyed
the
rapid
economic
growth
cities
like
Kraków
,
Warsaw
and
Wrocław
have
experienced
,
and
has
had
to
endure
the
fall
of
much
of
its
textile
industry
,
rising
unemployment
and
emigration
(
within
Poland
and
abroad
)
.
This
led
to
further
dilapidation
of
the
investment-starved
city
,
and
many
of
its
streets
and
buildings
show
profound
signs
of
neglect
.
At
first
glance
,
for
a
city
of
760,000
and
agglomeration
of
1.428,000
,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
to
see
.
However
,
the
situation
is
rapidly
changing
now
with
Łódź
campaigning
and
redesigning
itself
as
an
up-and-coming
destination
.
To
accomplish
this
,
Łódź
has
been
capitalizing
on
its
film
history
-
Łódź
is
jokingly
referred
to
as
the
"
HollyŁódź
"
of
Poland
and
hosts
several
film
festivals
and
many
other
cultural
events
.
Łódź
today
may
not
have
the
glitz
and
glamour
of
its
heyday
;
however
,
there
is
a
certain
charm
to
Łódź
in
its
partially
renovated
façades
and
leitmotivs
,
not
to
mention
its
grand
artistic
traditions
.
Mérida
Mérida
is
the
capital
of
the
state
of
Yucatán
in
Mexico
.
It
has
a
population
of
about
750,000
,
and
is
the
largest
city
in
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
.
Catedral
de
San
Ildefonso
Zócalo
or
Main
Plaza
,
with
the
Cathedral
in
the
distance
Understand
Mérida
is
a
city
of
contrasts
.
You
will
find
elegant
hotels
,
restaurants
and
malls
in
the
northern
part
of
the
city
.
Downtown
,
there
are
hotels
and
restaurants
to
suit
every
budget
.
A
large
central
market
and
numerous
small
shops
are
found
all
around
the
main
plaza
.
Mérida
has
a
rich
cultural
life
which
also
reflects
its
diversity
.
Many
free
concerts
,
performances
and
other
events
are
held
daily
.
The
city
was
founded
by
the
Spanish
conquistadors
in
the
1540s
on
top
of
a
centuries-old
Maya
city
called
T'ho
.
The
palatial
home
of
the
family
of
conquistador
leader
Montejo
can
still
be
seen
on
the
south
side
of
the
Zócalo
or
main
square
.
Here
and
there
bits
of
ancient
Maya
stonework
can
be
seen
reused
in
Spanish
Colonial
era
buildings
in
the
old
part
of
town
.
From
the
later
1800s
to
the
1920s
Mérida
enjoyed
prosperous
boom
times
fueled
by
the
henequen
or
sisal
plant
harvest
,
which
made
Yucatán
the
rope
maker
to
the
world
.
Progressive
Mérida
had
electric
trams
and
street
lights
before
Mexico
City
.
The
wealthy
constructed
the
grand
Pasejo
Montejo
avenue
north
of
the
old
town
,
inspired
by
the
Champs-Élysées
in
Paris
.
With
the
development
of
artificial
twines
the
sisal
boom
ended
,
and
Mérida
slowed
to
a
more
sleepy
provincial
capital
until
development
picked
back
up
in
the
late
20th
century
.
The
city
's
ambiance
is
colonial
and
the
climate
is
tropical
.
The
daytime
temperature
varies
;
in
January
,
it
is
about
24
°
C
(
75
°
F
)
and
in
June
,
about
35
°
C
(
95
°
F
)
.
To
beat
the
heat
,
most
people
are
busiest
in
the
mornings
.
They
have
lunch
and
siesta
,
then
go
back
to
work
for
a
few
hours
in
the
late
afternoon
.
The
cool
breezes
from
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
drift
into
Mérida
in
the
evenings
and
this
is
when
many
of
the
residents
spend
their
time
outdoors
.
You
can
see
them
visiting
and
talking
as
they
stroll
along
the
streets
,
sit
in
the
plazas
or
dine
in
the
many
sidewalk
restaurants
.
From
Mérida
,
it
is
easy
to
take
day
trips
to
a
vast
array
of
destinations
:
archaeological
sites
,
ecological
parks

Phoenix
Phoenix
is
the
capital
of
the
state
of
Arizona
as
well
as
the
most
populous
city
in
the
American
Southwest
and
sixth
largest
city
in
the
United
States
.
Founded
in
1871
,
it
has
become
the
region
's
primary
political
,
cultural
,
economic
,
and
transportation
center
.
At
an
elevation
of
1100
ft
(
335
m
)
,
it
is
situated
in
the
biologically
unique
Sonoran
Desert
.
Over
time
it
has
merged
with
the
neighboring
cities
of
Scottsdale
,
Tempe
,
Glendale
,
Peoria
,
Chandler
,
and
Gilbert
to
form
the
Greater
Phoenix
Metropolitan
Area
.
Currently
exurbs
such
as
Apache
Junction
,
Fountain
Hills
,
Queen
Creek
,
and
Sun
City
are
becoming
part
of
this
metropolitan
area
as
well
.
Phoenix
is
extremely
hot
and
dry
in
the
summertime
,
so
always
have
sunscreen
with
you
!
Understand
Why
would
anybody
want
to
start
a
city
in
the
middle
of
a
desert
?
The
answer
is
,
surprisingly
,
agriculture
.
The
Salt
and
Verde
Rivers
of
central
Arizona
were
exploited
for
large-scale
agriculture
by
Native
Americans
as
early
as
the
11th
century
.
The
area
that
now
encompasses
Phoenix
was
a
center
of
the
Hohokam
culture
,
which
built
large
canal
systems
and
a
network
of
towns
and
villages
,
whose
remains
may
be
viewed
in
the
city
to
this
day
.
White
settlers
discovered
the
remnants
of
the
Hohokam
culture
in
the
19th
century
.
The
city
's
name
reflects
its
history
as
a
city
"
reborn
from
the
ashes
"
of
the
previous
settlement
.
European-American
settlement
of
the
area
commenced
in
the
1860s
,
and
in
1911
the
completion
of
the
first
of
several
large
reservoirs
in
the
mountains
north
and
east
of
Phoenix
insured
its
success
as
a
center
for
irrigation-based
agriculture
.
Many
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
were
planted
in
citrus
and
cotton
and
other
crops
,
and
for
many
years
,
intensive
,
year-round
irrigated
agriculture
formed
the
basis
of
the
economy
.
Recent
years
are
seeing
a
revival
,
and
trendy
hotels
,
bars
,
shops
and
restaurants
are
making
it
a
place
to
be
again
.
Warm
and
sunny
winter
weather
also
ensured
a
thriving
tourism
industry
,
and
encouraged
many
Easterners
and
Midwesterners
to
relocate
to
Phoenix
.
High-tech
industry
began
to
flourish
after
World
War
II
,
and
since
that
time
the
growth
of
Phoenix
has
been
explosive
.
As
a
result
,
a
population
of
just
over
100,000
in
1950
has
given
way
to
a
2014
estimate
of
1,537,058
(
with
the
metro
area
estimated
at
4,489,109
)
.
Climate
Phoenix
has
an
arid
climate
with
long
,
hot
summers
and
very
mild
winters
.
It
has
the
highest
average
temperature
of
any
metropolitan
area
in
the
States
.
The
weather
varies
enormously
from
one
season
to
the
next
.
While
it
's
not
as
cold
as
in
the
northern
states
during
the
winter
,
it
does
freeze
sometimes
,
and
temperatures
in
the
30s
°
F
(
that
's
around
or
slightly
above
0
°
C
)
are
not
unheard
of
.
In
the
summer
,
very
hot
and
dry
heat
is
the
norm
.
On
the
hottest
days
,
it
can
get
up
to
115
°
F
(
46
°
C
)
or
more
.
Monsoon
rains
with
lightning
occur
regularly
from
July
to
September
during
the
late
afternoon
and
evening
,
occasionally
overnight
also
.
April
is
the
most
ideal
month
.
In
some
neighborhoods
,
cicada
insects
make
loud
sounds
from
sunset
to
sunrise
.
Talk
English
is
the
dominant
language
in
Phoenix
.
However
,
like
much
of
the
Southwest
with
a
large
Hispanic
population
,
Spanish
is
very
widely
spoken
in
Phoenix
.
Spanish
is
a
language
often
used
for
day-to-day
discourse
in
many
places
,
although
English
is
the
language
of
preference
,
especially
when
dealing
with
businesses
and
government
.

Understand
Due
to
its
remarkable
biodiversity
,
with
over
a
third
of
the
local
plant
species
found
nowhere
else
,
Socotra
has
been
designated
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
.
With
over
40,000
inhabitants
,
though
,
it
's
not
just
a
nature
reserve
.
The
Island
is
new
to
tourism
,
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
luxurious
vacation
this
is
not
the
right
destination
.
However
,
Socotra
is
a
perfect
destination
for
the
adventurous
and
nature
loving
travelers
.
Socotra
takes
pride
in
their
eco-tourism
and
values
their
spectacular
plant
and
wildlife
that
may
sometimes
be
only
found
on
this
island
.
Although
the
lodging
and
facilities
may
not
be
the
same
as
more
modern
and
developed
locations
,
Socotra
is
a
beautiful
and
magnificent
destination
choice
.
Great
care
is
shown
to
both
guests
and
the
environment
.
Socotra
is
an
eco-tourism
system
with
limited
infrastructure
and
new
to
the
international
tourist
market
,
and
therefore
the
hotel
accommodations
are
not
quite
like
other
destinations
.
However
there
are
four
hotels
in
Hadibo
:
Taj
Socotra
Hotel
,
Hafijj
Hotel
,
Socotra
Hotel
,
and
Summer
land
Hotel
.
These
hotels
may
not
be
the
most
luxerious
,
but
they
do
provide
air-conditionting
,
televisions
,
and
refrigerators
in
all
of
the
rooms
.
Most
of
the
rooms
at
these
hotels
have
their
own
bathroom
,
but
there
are
a
few
rooms
at
the
Hafijj
Hotel
and
Socotra
Hotel
that
must
share
bathrooms
.
Fortunately
,
there
is
a
restaurant
in
each
of
the
hotels
with
simple
yet
delicious
cuisine
.
Considering
Socotra
is
a
fairly
new
eco-tourism
destination
,
their
facilities
are
decent
.
In
addition
,
there
is
also
another
hotel
at
the
airport
as
well
as
multiple
guest
houses
around
the
island
.
The
most
popular
lodging
is
actually
camping
on
the
beaches
.
There
are
several
campsites
that
allow
tourists
to
barbeque
on
the
beach
with
beautiful
mountain
views
in
the
background
.
Tourists
can
choose
to
purchase
camping
tour
packages
which
include
a
driver
or
guide
that
will
show
tourists
around
the
beaches
as
well
as
provide
meals
during
their
stay
.
It
is
a
fantastic
way
to
enjoy
the
beauty
and
wildlife
of
the
island
.
A
runway
that
provides
fairly
regular
airline
transportation
was
only
constructed
in
1999
.
Like
everything
else
,
infrastructure
and
transportation
has
only
just
begun
in
recent
years
.
There
are
also
plans
for
new
harbor
facilities
that
will
allow
fisherman
to
sell
and
catch
more
easily
and
make
importing
food
and
fuel
simpler
.
In
addition
,
there
are
also
two
information
centers
located
at
the
airport
and
Hadibo
.
When

west
of
the
island
,
wind

See
Socotra
is
considered
the
jewel
of
biodiversity
in
the
Arabian
Sea
.
Although
the
region
is
small
,
it
is
characterized
by
unique
land
and
marine
biodiversity
.
The
interior
of
the
island
is
dominated
by
the
beautiful
and
green
Hagghier
mountains
and
limestone
plateau
.
While
on
the
outer
coastline
,
breathtaking
natural
beaches
have
pure
white
sand
dunes
and
palm
trees
.
Socotra
Island
is
very
rich
and
is
home
to
many
rare
spectacular
species
of
reefs
,
fish
,
birds
,
plants
,
and
trees
which
are
not
found
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
The
limestone
plateau
and
the
Hagghier
Mountains
are
the
richest
areas
for
endemic
plant
species
,
but
endemics
are
found
throughout
the
island
in
every
type
of
vegetation
.
One
of
the
most
famous
plants
is
the
dragon
's
blood
tree
“
dracaena
cinnabara
”
which
exists
only
on
Socotra
and
nowhere
else
on
the
Earth
.
The
tree
got
its
name
because
if
any
damage
is
made
to
the
bark
then
a
dark
red
liquid
oozes
out
.
The
dragon
's
blood
tree
thrives
in
Socotra
's
arid
climate
There
is
also
the
Desert
Rose
(
adenium
obesium
)
which
looks
like
a
blooming
elephant
leg
.
Also
found
in
Socotra
's
landscape
is
the
ever-strange
and
extremely
rare
Cucumber
Tree
.
In
addition
there
are
over
120
species
of
birds
and
about
190
species
of
butterflies
.
There
is
so
much
beauty
all
around
the
island
,
it
is
difficult
not
the
appreciate
to
magnificent
scenery
and
wildlife
.
Tulsa
Tulsa
is
in
the
Green
Country
region
of
Oklahoma
.
It
is
also
called
“
T-town
”
by
the
locals
and
has
been
called
the
"
Oil
Capital
of
the
World
"
.
The
city
had
about
391,000
people
and
the
metro
area
had
about
937,000
people
as
of
2010
from
the
US
Census
Bureau
.
The
Tulsa
Bartlesville
Combined
area
had
988,000
in
the
2010
census
.
Understand
Tulsa
lies
in
northeastern
Oklahoma
,
at
the
convergence
of
the
Great
Plains
and
the
Ozark
Plateau
,
and
receives
an
average
of
40
inches
of
precipitation
each
year
,
both
of
which
account
for
its
abundant
beautiful
rolling
green
terrain
.
As
a
result
,
Tulsa
breaks
the
Oklahoma
stereotype
of
being
nothing
but
a
flat
,
arid
dust
bowl
.
Summers
can
be
very
warm
and
with
the
cold
wind
across
the
plains
it
can
get
very
cold
in
the
winter
,
but
it
does
not
last
long
.
The
winters
are
considered
to
be
very
mild
.
There
is
not
much
snow
,
just
a
few
inches
each
year
,
typically
,
although
in
2007
and
again
in
2008
there
were
rather
large
"
ice
storms
"
.
Tulsa
has
over
225
days
of
sunshine
annually
.
In
Tulsa
you
will
find
old
west
charm
as
well
as
a
cosmopolitan
atmosphere
.
You
will
find
the
people
of
Tulsa
love
their
city
and
they
have
that
southern
charm
,
so
they
are
willing
to
help
you
find
your
way
around
.
Tulsa
has
one
of
the
largest
concentrations
of
Art
Deco
in
the
nation
,
having
been
a
booming
city
during
the
1920s
when
the
architecture
was
first
built
by
rich
oil
barons
who
built
stately
mansions
and
turned
the
Downtown
area
into
a
treasure
trove
of
art
.
Get

By

Tulsa
International
Airport
(
IATA
:
TUL
)
in
the
northern
part
of
Tulsa
.
It
has
major
airlines
with
direct
flights
to
major
cities
in
the
U.S.
It
is
a
small
but
nice
airport
with
sofas
and
chairs
all
around
and
a
very
laid-back
feel
.
The
car
rental
area
and
parking
is
well
integrated
.
The
airport
offers
free
short
term
parking
(

Get
around
Thanks
to
urban
planning
,
the
major
city
streets
are
placed
in
a
grid
layout
.
Almost
all
major
intersections
are
one
mile
from
each
other
,
and
exactly
in
a
straight
line
.
That
makes
it
much
easier
to
find
places
than
in
cities
where
streets
go
every
which
way
.
The
major
exception
is
downtown
,
which
is
slanted
at
almost
a
45
degree
angle
to
the
rest
of
the
grid
.
By
car
Several
freeways
and
bypasses
can
be
used
to
easily
get
around
the
Tulsa
Metro
area
:
I-244
,
I-44
,
US
169
(
Mingo
Valley
Expressway
,
aka
"
Pearl
Harbor
Memorial
Expressway
"
)
,
US
75
,
Hwy
51
(
Broken
Arrow
Expressway
,
The
"
B.A.
"
)
,
Creek
Turnpike
.
The
streets
and
avenues
are
planned
on
a
1
mile
by
1
mile
grid
system
,
with
the
main
arterials
running
on
each
mile
.
In
the
core
of
the
city
,
named
avenues
run
north
/
south
and
are
named
after
US
cities
,
generally
in
repeating
alphabetical
order
(
for
example
,
Winston
-
Yale
-
Allegheny
-
Braden
)
.
In
the
mid-town
area
the
names
are
taken
from
colleges
and
college
towns
.
North
/
South
is
divided
by
Admiral
Blvd
.
Name
streets
East
of
Main
are
cities
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
,
vice
versa
for
name
streets
west
of
Main
.
In
the
parts
of
the
city
farther
from
downtown
,
north-south
streets
are
numbered
.
It
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
specific
format
of
the
north-south
numbered
street
names
is
North
/
South
145th
East
/
West
Avenue
.
Numbered
streets
run
East
/
West
with
Main
Street
and
the
Arkansas
River
as
the
dividing
line
.
Watch
out
for
Place
,
Street
,
Avenue
designation
,
e.g.
47th
Place
,
47th
Street
,
or
Florence
Place
,
Florence
Avenue
.
It
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
specific
format
of
the
east-west
numbered
street
names
is
West
/
East
71st
Street
North
/
South
.
In
some
parts
of
the
city
,
numbered
streets
intersect
,
so
the
distinction
is
important
.
Although
rare
,
one
east-west
numbered
street
may
even
intersect
with
a
street
of
the
same
number
running
north-south
.
Downtown
streets
were
originally
platted
parallel
to
the
Frisco
railroad
tracks
.
When
Tulsa
expanded
beyond
the
bounds
of
its
original
plat
,
the
expanded
areas
were
platted
in
alignment
with
the
points
of
the
compass
.
Thus
the
"
twisted
"
area
down-town
represents
the
original
extent
of
Tulsa
ca
1907
.
By
bus
Tulsa
Transit
provides
bus
service
for
the
Tulsa
Metro
area
.
Cities
served
are
Tulsa
,
Sand
Springs
,
Sapulpa
,
Jenks
,
and
Broken
Arrow
.
The
central
station
is
at
319
S.
Denver
(
downtown
)
.
They
do
not
run
that
often
,
especially
to
the
outer
towns
like
Broken
Arrow
.
Unlike
major
cities
in
the
Northeast
,
the
city
bus
is
not
a
major
form
of
transportation
in
the
city
.
It
is
usually
a
means
of
travel
for
those
who
are
without
their
own
motor
vehicle
.
By
bicycle
Tulsa
has
an
extensive
interconnected
paved
bike
trail
system
.
Rivertrail
follows
the
Arkansas
River
from
downtown
Tulsa
south
to
the
suburbs
.
The
Katy
Trail
runs
west
to
Sand
Springs
.
The
Osage
Trail
is
a
rails-to-trails
route
that
begins
at
the
OSU-Tulsa
campus
and
travels
north
15
miles
to
Skiatook
.
The
Creek
Trail
connects
Rivertrail
and
continues
east
through
Broken
Arrow
to
the
NSU-Broken
Arrow
campus
.
Riders
accustomed
to
flat
terrain
may
find
Tulsa
's
rolling
land
to
be
a
bit
more
challenging
,
particularly
during
the
heat
of
summer
.
If
you
are
looking
for
a
good
workout
,
the
Creek
Turnpike
Trail
follows
the
land
's
original
contours
.
Rivertrail
is
probably
be
best
choice
for
the
rider
seeking
an
easy
route
.
Four
bike
loan
depots
,
located
along
Rivertrail
,
allow
riders
to
borrow
a
bike
for
free
for
up
to
twenty-four
hours
.
Tulsa
has
an
active
bicycling
community
.
York
York
is
an
ancient
cathedral
city
with
a
history
that
dates
back
to
before
Roman
times
.
It
is
situated
in
Yorkshire
,
North
Yorkshire
,
England
with
some
of
the
best
preserved
historical
buildings
and
structures
in
Europe
.
As
of
the
2001
census
,
the
population
of
York
was
181,000
.
York
is
frequently
ranked
(
often
vying
with
Manchester
)
the
second
most
visited
city
in
England
after
London
.
York
Minster
Understand
York
was
known
as
Eboracum
by
the
Romans
,
who
founded
the
fortress
city
on
the
River
Ouse
in
the
year
71
.
York
was
home
first
to
the
Ninth
Legion
and
later
the
Sixth
.
York
quickly
became
one
of
the
most
important
cities
in
Roman
Britain
,
and
after
211
became
the
capital
of
the
province
Britannia
Inferior
.
Constantine
the
Great
-
later
responsible
for
making
Christianity
the
official
religion
of
the
Roman
Empire
-
was
first
proclaimed
Emperor
in
the
city
.
Captured
by
the
Vikings
866
,
the
city
quickly
took
on
a
new
identity
as
Jorvik
(
pronounced
"
Yor-vik
"
)
and
experienced
a
major
urban
revival
as
a
centre
of
Viking
trade
and
settlement
in
northern
England
.
The
Coppergate
excavations
of
the
1970s
revealed
much
of
this
Viking
past
.
York
is
a
fairly
small
city
-
four
days
is
enough
to
see
the
major
sights
although
York
is
a
city
that
reveals
its
charms
to
explorers
with
curiosity
and
patience
.
York
is
known
as
England
's
"
City
of
Festivals
"
as
there
are
regular
cultural
festivals
every
year
.
The
official
festivals
are
the
Viking
Festival
,
the
Festival
of
Angels
,
Early
Music
,
Late
Music
,
Horse
Racing
(
the
"
Ebor
Race
Meeting
"
)
,
Multicultural
Food
and
Arts
,
Chinese
New
Year
,
Mystery
Plays
,
Christmas
St
Nicholas
'
Fair
,
and
the
Food
and
Drink
Festival
.
It
's
a
romantic
city
for
a
weekend
break
.
York
is
full
of
magic
and
a
wonderful
place
to
bring
children
!
Get
in
Most
travellers
will
arrive
in
York
by
road
(
car
or
bus
)
or
rail
from
other
parts
of
the
UK
or
an
airport
.
By
car
Although
York
is
not
directly
on
any
of
the
main
north-south
motorways
,
the
connections
are
reasonably
good
.
From
the
south
,
the
quickest
route
is
probably
to
take
the
M1
northbound
to
junction
32
,
then
the
M18
eastbound
to
junction
2
,
the
A1M
northbound
to
junction
44
and
finally
the
A64
eastbound
to
the
York
Outer
Ring
Road
(
A1237
)
.
Alternatively
,
you
can
take
the
M1
all
the
way
to
the
A64
,
but
the
upper
reaches
of
the
M1
around
Sheffield
and
Leeds
can
get
very
congested
,
especially
in
the
rush
hours
.
From
the
west
,
the
A59
and
the
M62
provide
connections
from
Liverpool
and
Manchester
,
and
from
the
north
the
A1
and
the
A19
link
York
with
Tyneside
,
Northumberland
and
south-eastern
Scotland
.
Driving
into
the
city
centre
itself
is
something
to
avoid
.
Traffic
congestion
on
the
main
arterial
roads
serving
the
city
(
especially
the
A19
on
Bootham
and
the
Inner
Ring
Road
)
can
get
very
bad
,
especially
during
the
rush
hours
and
on
Saturday
mornings
.
The
remodelling
of
some
roads
near
bottleneck
junctions
to
accommodate
bicycle
lanes
has
made
traffic
jams
even
worse
still
in
recent
years
,
and
parking
in
the
city
centre
is
very
expensive
.
If
you
are
just
visiting
York
for
the
day
,
using
a
Park
and
Ride
[
1
]
costs
a
lot
less
than
trying
to
park
in
or
near
the
city
centre
,
and
there
are
five
sites
dotted
around
the
Outer
Ring
Road
.
However
,
the
last
buses
from
the
city
centre
leave
at
around
8
pm
in
the
evenings
and
you
are
not
allowed
to
leave
your
car
in
a
Park
and
Ride
overnight
.
Therefore
,
if
you
are
staying
overnight
in
York
and
arriving
by
car
,
make
sure
that
your
hotel
offers
parking
before
you
book
.
If
you

How
to
Detect
Arrogant
People
Do
you
always
seem
to
cross
paths
with
people
who
are
stuck
on
themselves
,
intolerant
of
people
different
from
them
,
rude
or
downright
arrogant
?
These
people
can
be
a
great
source
of
potential
pain
,
and
this
article
is
here
to
help
you
sort
the
arrogant
from
the
not-so-arrogant
.
Steps
Pay
attention
to
their
conversations
.
Do
n't
eavesdrop
,
but
when
they
're
talking
to
you
or
to
those
around
you
,
listen
to
them
.
Is
it
always
about
them
?
Do
they
get
mad
or
irritated
if
the
centre
of
attention
moves
to
someone
else
?
These
are
good
signs
of
arrogance
.
Arrogance
and
smugness
is
often
a
reflection
of
limited
life
experience
,
and
feeling
concerned
that
those
with
greater
life
experience
"
have
got
something
over
them
"
.
Rather
than
seeking
to
find
out
more
through
questions
and
learning
(
actions
viewed
by
them
as
showing
vulnerability
)
,
arrogant
people
tend
to
generalize
from
their
limited
,
narrow
life
experiences
and
try
to
impose
their
small
worldview
on
others
.
Jealousy
of
your
achievements
or
seeming
lifestyle
can
cause
another
person
to
feel
smug
or
arrogant
about
something
they
think
they
do
better
than
you
or
own
/
have
that
you
do
n't
.
Arrogant
people
have
an
extremely
strong
need
to
look
good
.
When
you
make
them
look
bad
-
even
if
it
is
the
slightest
offense
-
they
will
usually
be
very
mad
at
you
.
This
happens
when
you
question
(
or
at
least
seem
to
question
)
their
appearance
,
intelligence
,
athletic
abilities
,
or
anything
else
relating
to
their
self-image
.
Challenge
their
worldview
.
Do
n't
be
aggressive
––
just
skeptical
and
curious
.
If
they
get
upset
,
gauge
their
anger
.
If
it
's
minimal
,
they
may
be
simply
having
a
bad
day
.
But
if
they
're
enraged
,
then
they
may
see
you
as
questioning
their
'
perfect
little
world
.
'
And
having
one
of
those
is
usually
indicative
of
arrogance
.
At
some
point
or
another
,
most
people
realize
that
the
world
does
n't
revolve
around
them
.
Arrogant
people
counteract
this
by
creating
an
atmosphere
that
revolves
around
them
,
and
get
angry
if
they
're
reminded
of
the
real
world
.
Ambiguity
frightens
arrogant
people
because
it
suggests
imperfection
,
change
and
lack
of
certainty
(
realities
we
all
must
contend
with
as
best
we
can
)
.
As
such
,
instead
of
accepting
that
the
world
behaves
randomly
and
at
times
totally
averse
to
one
's
preferences
,
the
arrogant
person
seeks
to
control
everything
and
everyone
,
which
of
course
,
is
an
impossible
mission
.
Reality
hurts
when
it
intrudes
;
as
such
,
an
arrogant
person
is
less
likely
than
other
people
to
self-reflect
or
analyse
,
thereby
not
seeing
their
own
imperfections
.
They
may
also
give
themselves
undue
credit
for
positive
achievements
instead
of
acknowledging
the
input
of
others
or
of
circumstances
.
Learn
the
quality
of
their
friendships
.
Do
n't
be
nosy
or
gossipy
,
but
if
they
are
happy
with
someone
one
day
and
hateful
with
them
the
next
,
that
's
a
sign
of
them
having
a
lot
of
fair
weather
friends
.
That
's
a
sign
of
arrogance
,
since
it
is
very
hard
to
be
a
truly
good
friend
to
someone
who
's
stuck
on
themselves
.
Prideful
people
have
a
strong
need
to
look
good
,
and
being
self-sufficient
is
an
effective
way
to
do
that
.
Since
being
a
good
friend
to
someone
usually
means
helping
them
,
they
often
ca
n't
stand
the
thought
of
a
good
friendship
.
Ironically
,
arrogant
people
often
ca
n't
understand
why
they
do
n't
have
any
reliable
and
supportive
friends
.
How
do
they
treat
those
not
like
themselves
?
In
other
words
,
how
do
they
treat
those
with
different
beliefs
,
cultural
backgrounds
and
ways
of
seeing
the
world
?
If
it
's
inherently
negative
,
then
they
're
either
over-zealous
,
ignorant
of
other
people
or
what
to
avoid
those
that
contradict
their
fantasy
land
that
caters
to
them
and
them
only
.
Determine
this
based
on
their
general
personality
and
the
people
they
're
interacting
with
.
Many
times
prideful
people
have
a
serious
'
my-way's-the-only-way
'
attitude
.
This
is
simply
a
protective
mechanism
for
their
false
image
or
their
fantasy
land
.
What
's
their
personality
like
?
Take
note
of
how
they
act
,
talk
,
and
use
their
social
status
.
Do
they
have
a
general
sense
of
'
coolness
?
'
Are
they
a
chatterbox
?
Do
they
act
like
they
own
the
place
,
or
act
like
the
'
big
dog
?
'
Are
they
very
keen
on
their
self-image
?
Many
arrogant
people
have
a
false
charm
that
no
one
seems
to
see
through
.
But
the
arrogant
person
is
usually
more
than
happy
to
show
their
cruel
side
to
those
that
they
do
n't
like
.
When
they
are
cruel
,
their
friends
will
usually
ignore
it
or
not
do
anything
to
stop
it
since
they
're
afraid
that
they
'll
be
treated
badly
by
their
'
friend
.
'
Mention
people
you
know
that
they
do
n't
like
.
This
is
n't
meant
to
begin
a
conflict
,
but
to
gauge
their
rivalries
,
annoyances
and
enmities
.
If
their
condemnation
seems
to
be
reasonable
,
they
probably
are
n't
hubristic
.
If
it
's
harsh
,
they
are
.
For
the
most
part
,
arrogant
people
see
people
that
they
do
n't
like
as
threats
to
their
perfect
little
world
.
The
more
they
hate
someone
,
the
more
dangerous
that
person
is
to
their
fantasy
land
.
And
in
turn
,
the
bigger
the
threat
,
the
harsher
the
criticism
.
Ask
around
to
see
what
they
've
been
saying
about
you
.
If
they
have
been
saying
bad
things
about
you
,
they
may
simply
not
like
you
.
If
they
're
nice
to
your
face
,
but
talk
bad
about
you
behind
your
back
like
it
's
their
favourite
hobby
,
then
they
probably
have
a
problem
with
pride
.
Arrogant
people
often
subconsciously
know
that
they
do
n't
have
any
good
friends
.
They
compensate
for
this
by
creating
the
impression
that
they
have
a
lot
of
friends
-
they
have
a
'
quantity
,
not
quality
'
mentality
.
Then
they
simply
insult
their
trophy
friends
when
they
are
n't
looking
.
How
to
Ballet
Dance
Ballet
began
in
royal
courts
in
the
early
1600's
,
and
early
forms
of
this
elegant
and
sophisticated
art
involved
long
skirts
and
wooden
clogs
.
Dancing
ballet
is
extremely
popular
throughout
the
world
,
and
studying
ballet
can
help
develop
strong
bodies
,
spatial
and
temporal
awareness
,
and
improve
coordination
.
People
who
study
ballet
also
retain
flexibility
throughout
their
adult
lives
,
making
this
technique
the
basis
of
training
for
all
types
of
dance
.
While
dancing
ballet
takes
dedication
and
requires
serious
training
,
you
can
learn
the
basics
to
prepare
yourself
for
further
study
.
Learn
to
get
ready
for
practicing
,
the
basic
positions
,
and
some
of
the
first
techniques
you
're
likely
to
encounter
in
ballet
.
Part
1
Getting
Ready
to
Dance
Stretch
your
muscles
thoroughly
.
Stretching
is
important
to
loosen
muscles
,
strengthen
muscles
and
to
elongate
your
posture
.
It
is
vital
that
it
is
done
at
the
beginning
of
each
ballet
session
,
including
before
a
performance
.
When
taking
on
ballet
,
it
is
important
to
stretch
daily
for
at
least
15
-
30
minutes
,
to
give
the
muscles
ample
opportunity
to
warm
up
,
reducing
the
risk
of
injury
.
You
should
also
stretch
to
"
wind
down
"
at
the
end
of
ballet
dancing
.
Always
wear
ballet
slippers
.
Properly-fitted
ballet
shoes
should
be
snug
,
but
not
so
tight
they
cut
off
blood
flow
and
create
numbness
in
the
feet
.
There
are
different
styles
and
types
of
shoes
,
so
ask
your
ballet
teacher
or
a
salesman
at
the
store
for
advice
,
given
your
intentions
for
dancing
.
Do
n't
buy
shoes
to
grow
into
,
because
your
feet
will
seem
flexed
when
you
pointe
and
will
look
flat
.
You
should
fit
them
to
where
the
drawstring
is
tied
slightly
loose
.
If
your
drawstring
is
longer
than
your
pinkie
then
you
should
cut
it
off
till
it
is
roughly
the
size
of
your
fingernail
.
The
drawstring
just
completes
the
fit
.
It
is
n't
made
to
tighten
overly
large
shoes
.
If
you
ca
n't
buy
ballet
shoes
,
that
it
is
okay
.
Use
socks
without
the
stickies
on
the
bottom
,
so
you
can
turn
!
Wear
comfortable
and
snug-fitting
athletic
clothes
.
The
most
important
thing
is
that
you
are
comfortable
,
and
that
you
're
not
wearing
baggy
or
loose
fitting
clothing
so
you
can
make
sure
you
're
forming
and
moving
correctly
in
the
mirror
.
A
plain
black
leotard
and
pink
tights
are
usually
a
safe
bet
.
Pink
or
black
ballet
slippers
are
also
appropriate
.
If
you
're
signed
up
for
a
class
,
check
with
your
instructor
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
dress
code
at
the
school
.
Some
schools
may
have
students
wear
the
same
thing
and
others
may
just
require
any
type
of
leotard
and
tights
and
sometimes
ballet
skirts
.
Mostly
they
require
tight
fitting
clothing
so
they
can
see
that
your
muscles
are
working
properly
and
so
on
.
Find
an
appropriate
space
to
practice
.
Ballet
is
less
about
learning
the
moves
and
more
about
perfecting
them
.
The
moves
themselves
are
relatively
straightforward
,
but
the
positing
,
the
timing
,
and
the
elegance
required
takes
a
lifetime
of
practice
.
For
this
reason
,
it
's
always
better
to
practice
ballet
in
a
ballet
studio
under
the
guidance
of
a
good
instructor
,
who
will
be
able
to
correct
your
positioning
and
make
sure
that
you
're
dancing
properly
.
A
dancing
studio
is
equipped
with
mirrors
for
correcting
your
positioning
and
seeing
what
you
're
doing
accurately
,
and
a
barre
for
practicing
.
[
1
]
If
you
want
to
practice
at
home
,
make
sure
you
've
got
enough
open
space
to
move
freely
,
preferably
on
a
hard
wood
floor
.
The
back
of
a
chair
can
replace
the
need
for
a
bar
.
Position
a
large
mirror
so
you
can
check
your
positioning
and
see
what
you
're
doing
.
How
to
Grow
Basil
Three
Methods
:
Starting
Seeds
Caring
for
Basil
Harvesting
and
Using
Basil
Basil
is
easy
to
grow
,
and
transforms
ordinary
meals
into
culinary
treasures
!
Fresh
basil
not
only
tastes
better
than
dried
,
it
actually
tastes
different
,
almost
as
if
it
were
not
the
same
herb
.
This
article
outlines
how
to
plant
and
harvest
basil
.
Method
1
of
3
:
Starting
Seeds
1
Choose
the
kind
of
basil
you
wish
to
grow
.
Basil
comes
in
many
different
varieties
,
each
of
which
have
a
unique
flavor
and
smell
.
Read
up
on
different
types
of
basil
and
pick
out
one
-
or
several
-
that
appeal
to
you
,
then
order
the
seeds
or
buy
them
at
a
garden
store
.
Here
are
a
few
ideas
:
Cinnamon
basil
really
does
smell
like
the
sweet
spice
,
and
it
also
has
unusually
beautiful
and
fragrant
flowers
.
Lemon
basil
actually
contains
citral
,
an
aromatic
compound
found
in
citrus
fruit
,
and
smells
very
lemony
.
Purple
basil
is
often
grown
for
decoration
,
as
well
as
its
scent
and
flowers
.
There
are
perennial
basils
which
come
back
year
after
year
,
like
African
Blue
Basil
(
which
has
pretty
blue
veins
on
its
leaves
)
and
Thai
Basil
,
while
most
other
varieties
are
annuals
,
which
you
'll
have
to
plant
year
after
year
.
Globe
and
Greek
basil
are
much
more
difficult
to
grow
,
but
form
pretty
little
bushes
which
stay
well-contained
.
2
Start
seed
indoors
four
to
six
weeks
before
last
frost
.
Basil
needs
warm
air
and
sun
to
do
well
,
so
it
's
often
easiest
to
start
the
seeds
indoors
instead
of
risking
that
they
'll
get
damaged
by
frost
.
If
you
live
in
a
hot
climate
,
you
can
start
the
seeds
outside
instead
.
To
figure
out
when
the
last
frost
will
be
,
consult
an
almanac
or
talk
with
other
gardeners
in
your
area
.
3
Prepare
seed
containers
.
Fill
flats
or
individual
seed
containers
with
a
mixture
of
equal
parts
perlite
,
vermiculite
,
and
peat
.
Press
the
mixture
slightly
to
eliminate
air
pockets
.
Dampen
the
mixture
with
water
so
it
's
ready
to
provide
the
right
environment
for
the
basil
seeds
to
germinate
.
4
Plant
the
seeds
.
Drop
one
to
two
seeds
into
each
container
.
Cover
them
lightly
with
soil
.
Cover
containers
with
clear
plastic
kitchen
wrap
,
so
they
stay
moist
.
Leave
the
containers
in
a
sunny
window
.
Twice
daily
,
remove
the
plastic
wrap
and
sprinkle
the
containers
with
more
water
.
5
Remove
the
plastic
wrap
when
the
sprouts
emerge
.
When
you
see
the
first
green
tendrils
push
up
through
the
soil
,
it
's
time
to
remove
the
plastic
wrap
.
Keep
watering
the
sprouts
twice
daily
,
never
letting
the
soil
dry
out
.
When
the
plants
become
a
few
inches
tall
and
their
leaves
mature
,
it
's
time
to
transplant
them
to
a
larger
container
.
Method
2
of
3
:
Caring
for
Basil
1
Transplant
the
basil
plants
.
Once
two
sets
of
leaves
have
formed
,
basil
can
be
planted
into
the
garden
or
permanent
containers
.
Basil
does
not
tolerate
frost
so
do
n't
plant
too
early
.
It
's
best
to
put
basil
somewhere
where
it
will
get
a
good
deal
of
sunshine
and
have
well-drained
soil
.
To
plant
the
basil
in
the
garden
,
dig
holes
spaced
at
least
6
inches
apart
.
Place
the
roots
in
the
holes
and
place
soil
around
the
stems
.
Pat
down
soil
around
the
plants
to
eliminate
air
pockets
.
If
you
want
to
plant
the
basil
in
a
container
,
make
sure
it
's
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
number
of
plants
you
're
growing
;
they
need
to
be
planted
6
inches
apart
,
since
they
grow
quite
large
.
2
Keep
the
soil
damp
,
but
not
soaked
.
Basil
does
best
in
well-drained
soil
,
and
should
not
be
subjected
to
standing
water
.
Water
the
mature
basil
plants
once
a
day
,
in
the
morning
,
so
the
water
has
time
to
soak
in
and
evaporate
rather
than
sitting
on
the
plants
overnight
.
3
Pinch
off
flower
heads
.
When
you
see
flower
buds
,
pinch
them
and
two
pairs
of
leaves
under
them
off
.
Flowers
blooming
create
a
hormone
change
which
dramatically
reduces
the
flavor
of
the
leaves
,
as
well
as
reducing
the
amount
of
foliage
which
grows
.
This
is
called
"
bolting
"
and
is
more
likely
to
happen
when
there
's
extra
sunshine
.
You
'll
notice
that
if
you
leave
the
flowers
,
the
plant
will
become
lanky
and
the
leaves
wo
n't
be
as
full
or
tasty
.
4
Watch
for
pests
and
mold
.
Basil
plants
are
attractive
to
Japanese
beetles
the
best
way
to
control
these
pests
is
to
pick
them
off
the
plants
by
hand
.
If
your
plants
show
signs
of
mold
growth
,
they
may
not
be
getting
adequate
sunlight
,
or
they
may
be
too
close
together
.
Weed
out
the
smaller
plants
to
give
the
larger
ones
more
space
.
Method
3
of
3
:
Harvesting
and
Using
Basil
1
Harvest
and
prune
.
As
the
plant
matures
,
pinch
off
the
top
two
pairs
of
leaves
once
a
stalk
reaches
a
reasonable
height
.
If
you
look
closely
,
at
the
base
of
every
leaf
are
two
tiny
little
leaves
that
will
grow
outwards
if
the
stem
growing
between
them
is
cut
off
.
Cut
close
to
those
tiny
leaves
,
but
be
sure
not
to
damage
them
.
Pinching
encourages
the
plant
's
energy
to
be
directed
into
its
stronger
stems
and
leaves
.
This
helps
the
plants
grow
bushy
.
Do
n't
pinch
on
the
lower
part
of
the
stem
,
or
the
basil
plants
will
grow
tall
and
reedy
.
You
want
them
to
get
bushy
,
so
pinch
from
the
top
.
2
Enjoy
the
basil
fresh
.
Rinse
off
the
leaves
and
use
the
basil
to
make
pesto
or
a
Caprese
salad
with
tomatoes
and
fresh
mozzarella
cheese
.
3
Store
the
basil
in
the
refrigerator
.
You
'll
probably
have
more
basil
than
you
could
possibly
eat
fresh
,
so
plan
on
storing
some
in
the
fridge
.
Wash
the
leaves
,
dry
them
well
,
and
wrap
them
in
paper
towels
.
Place
them
in
a
food
storage
container
with
an
airtight
lid
.
4
Freeze
the
basil
.
Freezing
the
leaves
whole
does
n't
work
very
well
,
but
if
you
puree
it
first
you
can
freeze
it
for
months
.
Place
the
basil
in
a
blender
with
a
little
water
.
Puree
it
until
smooth
,
then
put
it
in
a
food
storage
bag
and
freeze
until
you
need
it
.
How
to
Hypnotize
a
Chicken
Anyone
who
's
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
a
farm
with
chickens
is
probably
familiar
with
this
trick
.
Those
who
've
never
heard
of
this
will
be
amazed
to
see
a
chicken
lie
perfectly
still
after
these
instructions
are
followed
.
Biologists
think
that
fear
causes
this
"
hypnosis
,
"
which
may
be
an
attempt
to
"
play
dead
"
to
fool
predators
.
Method
One
of
Two
:
Hypnotizing
a
Chicken
Hold
the
chicken
down
on
a
flat
surface
.
Hold
the
chicken
with
one
hand
supporting
the
breast
.
Place
it
down
so
that
its
breast
is
carrying
its
weight
and
rests
on
the
ground
.
Continue
to
hold
its
feet
so
the
grand
experiment
can
continue
.
You
can
place
the
chicken
on
its
breast
instead
.
Press
gently
down
on
its
back
,
and
gently
move
its
legs
back
if
it
tries
to
stand
up
.
Wiggle
your
finger
.
Hold
the
bird
down
gently
with
one
hand
.
Put
one
finger
on
your
other
hand
just
in
front
of
its
beak
tip
,
without
touching
it
.
Move
the
finger
backward
to
about
4
inches
(
10
cm
)
away
,
then
back
again
.
Repeat
until
the
chicken
stops
moving
or
squawking
.
Let
go
of
its
legs
.
The
chicken
should
be
"
hypnotized
"
and
cease
to
struggle
.
It
will
lie
there
for
anywhere
from
30
seconds
to
several
minutes
.
Draw
a
line
in
front
of
its
beak
instead
.
If
the
chicken
was
n't
hypnotized
,
try
this
alternative
.
Using
chalk
,
a
stick
,
or
your
finger
,
draw
a
line
on
the
ground
12
"
(
30
cm
)
long
.
Start
near
the
chicken
's
beak
and
draw
the
line
slowly
outward
,
in
front
of
its
head
.
Wake
it
up
by
clapping
.
Be
nice
to
your
feathered
friend
and
let
it
get
back
to
its
business
.
Clap
your
hands
or
give
it
a
gentle
shove
until
it
jumps
up
and
walks
away
.
Method
Two
of
Two
:
Reducing
Stress
in
the
Chicken
Understand
the
hypnotic
effect
.
Researchers
call
this
effect
"
tonic
immobility
"
.
This
may
be
an
attempt
to
play
dead
,
discouraging
predators
that
prefer
live
prey
.
Unlike
an
opossum
,
the
chicken
gives
an
unconvincing
act
,
as
it
continues
to
blink
and
breathe
in
an
obvious
way
.
"
Keep
the
chicken
upright
or
on
its
side
.
While
it
's
not
uncommon
to
transport
a
chicken
by
its
feet
,
this
upside-down
hold
risks
breaking
the
chicken
's
hip
.
Hypnosis
techniques
that
involve
laying
a
chicken
on
its
back
may
"
succeed
"
by
cutting
off
its
air
supply
.
This
can
cause
the
chicken
significant
discomfort
,
leading
to
fainting
or
even
,
rarely
,
death
.
Keep
hypnosis
short
and
infrequent
.
It
's
not
completely
clear
how
much
stress
this
hypnosis
causes
.
Even
if
it
does
,
the
chicken
should
n't
suffer
as
long
as
you
let
it
go
soon
afterward
.
Hours
of
stress
,
or
regular
exposure
to
stressful
situations
,
can
cause
serious
health
problems
.
Get
your
chickens
used
to
humans
and
novelty
.
Even
prolonged
eye
contact
seems
to
have
an
effect
.
Living
in
stimulating
environments
with
new
objects
may
also
help
.
Hens
raise
in
battery
cages
stay
"
hypnotized
"
longer
,
possibly
because
of
greater
fear
.
Watch
for
signs
of
stress
.
Abnormal
feathering
,
constant
preening
,
or
delays
in
egg-laying
are
all
signs
of
a
stressed
chicken
.
While
hypnotizing
is
unlikely
to
cause
serious
harm
,
any
type
of
stress
is
more
damaging
to
a
chicken
in
this
state
.
How
to
Annoy
People
in
Elevators
An
elevator
is
almost
the
perfect
environment
to
be
a
prankster
.
It
’s
easy
to
annoy
people
when
you
are
cramped
in
such
a
small
,
tight
space
.
Because
elevator
rides
usually
last
less
than
a
minute
,
make
sure
your
pranks
are
quick
and
have
a
lot
of
punch
.
When
annoying
people
on
an
elevator
,
keep
your
pranks
lighthearted
and
fun
as
opposed
to
mean-spirited
so
that
everyone
leaving
the
elevator
will
have
a
pleasant
story
to
tell
.
Method
1
Using
the
Elevator
to
Annoy
People
Push
all
the
buttons
.
When
you
get
into
the
elevator
,
push
the
button
for
every
floor
.
This
makes
everyone
’s
ride
on
the
elevator
longer
,
if
only
for
a
few
seconds
.
If
you
want
to
take
it
a
step
further
,
look
around
questioningly
at
everyone
in
the
elevator
when
no
one
gets
off
at
the
floors
you
pushed
.
[
1
]
When
someone
comes
in
,
say
,
"
I
've
got
this
,
"
before
you
push
all
of
the
buttons
.
You
can
also
push
all
the
buttons
as
you
reach
the
floor
you
are
getting
off
at
.
If
someone
asks
you
why
you
pushed
all
the
buttons
,
you
can
honestly
say
,
"
It
was
just
a
joke
!
"
Make
a
dinging
noise
at
each
floor
.
Every
time
the
elevator
reaches
a
new
floor
,
say
“
ding
!
”
very
loudly
.
You
can
even
sing
the
word
“
ding
”
on
each
floor
like
notes
in
a
scale
,
getting
higher
as
you
reach
each
new
floor
.
[
2
]
You
can
make
other
noises
if
you
prefer
,
such
as
a
bird
cawing
or
an
explosion
sound
every
time
a
button
is
pushed
.
Talk
to
your
reflection
in
the
mirror
.
Many
elevators
have
mirrors
on
the
walls
.
A
great
way
to
be
mischievous
in
an
elevator
is
to
carry
on
a
running
commentary
while
you
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
.
You
could
look
at
yourself
,
turning
to
catch
different
angles
and
say
“
All
right
,
all
right
,
now
we
’re
talking
,
”
very
loudly
.
You
could
also
keep
adjusting
your
shirt
or
your
hair
,
keeping
a
running
dialogue
about
what
look
is
best
for
you
.
Stand
in
the
corner
of
the
elevator
facing
the
wall
.
Do
n't
say
anything
the
whole
ride
.
Dance
to
the
elevator
music
.
Many
elevators
play
music
in
the
background
,
usually
soft
rock
or
smooth
jazz
.
If
you
’re
in
an
elevator
that
is
playing
music
,
start
to
dance
.
Start
just
bobbing
your
head
and
tapping
your
feet
,
and
then
get
your
whole
body
into
it
.
Take
up
as
much
space
as
you
can
to
dance
until
everyone
is
staring
at
you
.
[
3
]
Announce
every
floor
.
At
every
floor
,
make
a
loud
announcement
telling
everyone
the
floor
number
.
Say
something
like
“
Everyone
going
to
floor
ten
,
get
off
now
!
No
time
to
dilly
dally
!
”
[
4
]
You
can
also
pretend
to
conduct
people
onto
the
elevator
,
saying
“
All
aboard
the
elevator
train
!
”
Exclaim
that
you
've
lost
a
beast
.
When
the
elevator
is
going
from
the
bottom
floor
to
the
top
,
as
soon
as
the
doors
close
,
exclaim
that
you
lost
your
tarantula
/
snake
/
scorpion
but
confirm
that
it
is
somewhere
in
the
elevator
.
Most
people
will
probably
see
that
this
is
a
joke
.
However
,
if
somebody
looks
seriously
alarmed
or
is
starting
to
panic
,
let
them
know
that
you
were
not
being
serious
.
Build
in
or
add
something
to
the
elevator
.
For
example
,
build
a
Lego
city
in
the
middle
of
the
elevator
.
Lay
a
Twister
mat
on
the
floor
and
ask
people
if
they
want
to
play
.
Talk
to
people
.
When
there
are
a
lot
of
people
,
say
,
"
You
're
probably
wondering
why
I
've
gathered
you
here
today
.

How
to
Flirt
Through
Instant
Messaging
So
you
want
to
flirt
with
a
guy
or
gal
on
MSN
,
AIM
,
Facebook
Chat
,
or
any
other
instant
messaging
service
and
you
do
n't
want
to
look
like
a
creep
?
Congratulations
—
by
seeking
help
,
you
've
already
demonstrated
more
self-awareness
than
the
vast
majority
of
online
flirts
.
See
Step
1
below
to
start
flirting
smartly
and
respectfully
.
Part
1
of
2
:
Flirting
Dos
Start
the
conversation
casually
.
As
in
the
real
world
,
the
first
step
to
flirting
is
to
get
over
your
cold
feet
and
jump
right
in
!
Text
the
other
person
a
brief
message
asking
them
about
their
day
,
asking
them
a
specific
question
about
work
or
school
,
or
simply
saying
"
Hi
!
"
.
The
hardest
part
of
flirting
is
to
break
through
your
initial
reluctance
,
so
if
you
're
having
a
hard
time
taking
the
plunge
,
just
remind
yourself
that
no
matter
how
badly
it
goes
,
it
'll
be
less
stressful
than
an
equivalent
real-world
encounter
.
There
's
no
reason
to
be
nervous
when
it
comes
to
IM
flirting
—
if
the
person
you
want
to
talk
to
does
n't
want
to
talk
to
you
,
s/he
always
has
the
option
of
simply
not
responding
to
your
message
,
as
,
from
your
point
of
view
,
this
is
indistinguishable
from
him
or
her
simply
being
away
from
the
computer
.
This
being
said
,
if
you
barely
know
someone
,
it
can
be
a
good
idea
to
have
an
excuse
for
starting
a
conversation
to
avoid
awkwardness
.
Asking
for
help
with
a
work
or
school-related
problem
is
almost
always
a
good
bet
,
as
is
asking
a
question
about
something
striking
about
the
person
.
For
instance
,
if
the
person
has
a
band-related
username
,
you
might
say
:
"
Hey
,
cool
name
.
Did
you
see
those
guys
when
they
last
came
to
town
?
"
Start
small
talk
.
After
your
initial
greeting
and
exchange
of
pleasantries
,
you
'll
probably
want
to
ask
how
the
person
's
doing
(
just
like
you
might
in
the
real
world
)
.
Ask
him
or
her
about
work
or
school
,
his
/
her
interests
,
or
any
recent
trips
,
for
instance
.
Rather
than
asking
a
question
,
you
can
also
simply
offer
your
comments
on
these
things
.
When
s/he
responds
,
add
your
own
comments
or
ask
follow-up
questions
and
proceed
from
there
!
Do
n't
pry
into
his
or
her
personal
life
—
keep
things
light
,
fun
,
and
focused
on
worry-free
subjects
.
Do
n't
dwell
too
long
on
small
talk
.
A
minute
or
two
is
great
for
breaking
the
ice
,
but
much
more
can
get
boring
fast
.
For
example
,
after
we
've
opened
up
by
asking
about
this
person
's
interest
in
the
band
in
his
/
her
username
,
it
's
logical
and
reasonable
to
ask
about
this
person
's
musical
likes
and
dislikes
.
You
can
even
offer
your
own
opinions
and
suggestions
.
For
instance
,
you
might
say
something
like
:
"
If
you
like
those
guys
,
you
might
want
to
check
out
this
band
called
Manic
Albatross
-
they
're
like
the
Beatles
,
only
darker
.
What
sorts
of
other
bands
do
you
like
?
"
Joke
.
Everyone
likes
a
good
sense
of
humor
.
In
the
immortal
words
of
Marilyn
Monroe
,
"
If
you
can
make
a
woman
laugh
,
you
can
make
her
do
anything
"
(
do
n't
worry
,
ladies
—
the
same
is
true
for
men
!
)
Try
to
be
playful
and
even
slightly
sarcastic
as
you
respond
to
the
statements
of
the
person
you
're
talking
to
.
For
instance
,
if
you
're
asked
what
you
're
up
to
,
rather
than
saying
,
"
looking
for
people
to
hit
on
on
Facebook
"
you
might
find
that
it
's
a
better
idea
to
give
a
sarcastic
answer
like
"
writing
the
great
American
novel
"
or
"
drowning
my
sorrows
"
.
These
responses
have
the
added
benefit
of
being
natural
launching
points
for
conversations
about
your
hobbies
,
like
the
writing
you
're
doing
on
the
side
and
the
great
bourbon
you
tasted
the
other
day
.
In
our
example
conversation
,
you
might
work
a
joke
or
two
into
your
music-related
small
talk
.
For
instance
,
you
might
say
something
like
,
"
I
do
n't
know
why
every
song
on
the
radio
nowadays
has
a
Texas
Flynn
feature
.
Does
he
even
have
time
to
record
between
rehab
stints
?

:
Flirting
Don'ts
Do
n't
be
too
self-deprecating
.
Simply
put
,
confidence
is
sexy
.
This
is
more
true
for
real-life
situations
than
it
is
online
,
but
this
mantra
has
some
truth
in
the
world
of
IM
flirting
as
well
.
For
instance
,
you
'll
want
to
avoid
making
lots
of
jokes
at
your
own
expense
.
Just
one
is
plenty
—
it
should
n't
be
a
recurring
theme
throughout
your
conversation
.
Doing
this
too
often
can
quickly
turn
an
otherwise
flirtatious
conversation
into
one
in
which
you
appear
needy
and
self-loathing
.
On
the
other
hand
,
this
is
n't
to
say
that
you
should
necessarily
make
jokes
at
other
people
's
expense
,
as
this
can
make
you
seem
mean
and
petty
.
Any
sort
of
pointed
or
caustic
remarks
about
yourself
or
someone
else
do
n't
have
a
place
in
flirtatious
conversations
.
Do
n't
be
too
sappy
.
People
like
flirting
to
be
fun
.
For
most
people
,
receiving
compliments
is
only
fun
up
to
a
point
—
getting
more
than
one
or
two
can
make
someone
feel
embarrassed
and
self-conscious
.
It
can
also
make
him
or
her
question
your
motives
,
leading
the
person
to
believe
that
you
may
be
trying
to
get
something
out
of
him
or
her
.
Besides
,
the
wooing
power
of
flowery
,
gushing
compliments
is
diminished
(
to
say
the
least
)
when
the
compliments
are
displayed
in
a
tiny
box
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
alongside
cartoon
smiley
faces
.
Instead
of
relying
too
heavily
on
compliments
,
instead
,
focus
on
having
an
engaging
,
genuine
conversation
.
Follow
the
mantra
"
show
,
do
n't
tell
.
"
In
other
words
,
show
that
you
're
attracted
to
this
person
by
giving
him
or
her
a
great
conversation
,
not
by
stating
it
outright
.
How
to
Make
a
Glowstick
Those
glowing
Mountain
Dew
videos
with
peroxide
and
baking
soda
are
all
hoaxes
.
To
truly
make
a
glowstick
without
breaking
an
already-made
glowstick
and
shoving
its
contents
into
a
tube
(
also
known
as
cheating
)
,
you
've
gotta
let
your
inner
scientist
out
(
along
with
a
few
dollars
)
.
If
you
're
still
curious
,
read
on
.
This
is
fun
for
anyone
and
everyone
.
Method
One
of
Two
:
Using
Luminol
Put
on
protective
glasses
.
In
addition
,
wear
gloves
to
protect
your
skin
.
It
's
also
a
good
idea
to
not
wear
your
Sunday
best
.
Throw
on
some
old
clothes
or
put
a
smock
over
clothes
you
want
protected
.
Some
of
this
stuff
is
dangerous
--
this
experiment
is
not
meant
for
children
!
Listen
up
,
kids
:
You
'll
be
working
with
a
solution
that
's
near
a
12
on
the
pH
scale
.
That
basically
means
do
n't
swallow
it
,
do
n't
put
it
in
your
eyes
,
do
n't
bathe
in
it
,
and
do
n't
really
expose
yourself
to
it
directly
at
all
.
Got
it
?
Moving
on
.
Combine
50
milliliters
of
hydrogen
peroxide
and
a
liter
of
distilled
water
in
a
mixing
bowl
.
A
ceramic
bowl
will
work
best
,
but
plastic
works
too
.
Use
funnels
,
measuring
tubes
,
and
basters
to
keep
everything
well-measured
and
well
away
from
you
.
Hydrogen
peroxide
is
used
to
replace
the
luminol
's
nitrogen
atoms
with
oxygen
.
When
that
happens
,
all
the
substances
create
a
rave
and
start
partying
and
electrons
fly
everywhere
and
what
results
?
The
glow
.
Mix
.2
grams
of
luminol
,
4
grams
of
sodium
carbonate
,
.4
grams
of
copper
sulfate
,
.5
grams
of
ammonium
carbonate
and
1
liter
(
0.3
US
gal
)
of
distilled
water
in
a
second
bowl
.
It
is
important
not
to
touch
the
luminol
.
Use
a
funnel
to
make
everything
safe
and
easy
.
Unfortunately
,
these
hazardous
chemicals
will
not
float
freely
in
mid-air
like
this
graphic
suggests
.
Yep
,
unless
you
're
a
coroner
or
some
sort
of
crazy
spy
/
criminologist
you
probably
do
n't
have
this
stuff
lying
around
the
house
(
hopefully
not
...
)
.
If
you
're
dead
set
on
starting
your
own
glowstick
business
(
worse
ideas
exist
)
,
try
websites
like
Alfa
Aesar
[
1
]
or
Sigma
Aldrich
[
2
]
for
supplies
.
Mix
everything
well
.
Do
n't
use
your
hands
--
use
a
metal
or
plastic
utensil
of
some
sort
.
Clean
the
containers
and
dry
them
thoroughly
.
It
's
important
to
use
sanitary
,
clean
tubes
for
your
glowsticks
.
The
last
thing
you
want
is
other
substances
interacting
with
the
reactions
you
're
depending
on
to
make
the
substances
glow
.
Set
the
correct
lid
next
to
each
container
.
This
enables
you
to
seal
the
containers
quickly
after
filling
.
It
's
not
like
the
glow
will
get
up
and
run
away
from
you
,
but
still
.
Combine
equal
amounts
of
the
first
and
second
solution
in
the
container
and
close
the
bottles
.
Shake
them
up
once
the
lids
are
on
tightly
.
Then
turn
off
the
lights
!
If
it
's
not
already
glowing
,
something
went
wrong
.
Do
over
!
Watch
as
the
chemical
compound
creates
a
colorful
glow
.
Take
your
glowsticks
to
the
party
and
charge
your
friends
loads
of
money
for
them
!
But
act
quickly
...
the
glow
wo
n't
last
very
long
.
Expectations
crushed
?
Method
two
to
the
rescue
!
The
reaction
that
the
luminol
and
hydrogen
peroxide
creates
does
n't
last
long
at
all
--
maybe
a
couple
of
minutes
.
For
something
that
lasts
hours
,
go
to
the
next
method
(
which
is
a
lot
easier
to
facilitate
if
you
have
access
to
a
laboratory
,
but
it
's
still
worth
mentioning
)
.
Method
2
of
2
:
Using
Grammar
Name
your
language
.
This
is
the
most
fundamental
property
in
all
languages
.
You
have
many
names
to
choose
from
.
You
can
even
use
a
made
up
word
from
your
made
up
language
like
'
Victory
'
or
'
Great
Language
'
.
The
choice
is
all
yours
.
Start
off
with
the
highly
frequently
used
words
such
as
'
and
'
or
'
I
'
or
'
one
'
or
'
the
'
.
It
is
recommend
that
you
use
short
words
since
they
are
commonly
used
.
An
example
would
be
'
ant
'
for
and
or
'
es
'
or
even
'
loo
'
for
the
word
'
and
'
.
Start
thinking
about
the
grammar
rules
.
For
example
if
the
word
Bird
is
'
Vogelaviatiolap
'
then
why
not
make
the
word
Birds
'
Vogelaviatiolaps
'
since
the
suffix
'
s
'
is
added
at
the
end
for
most
languages
at
plurals
.
If
you
want
to
add
complication
,
you
can
add
genders
like
most
European
languages
like
French
and
German
.
For
example
,
if
you
want
the
word
'
horse
'
to
be
a
boy
,
you
may
want
'
the
horse
'
to
be
'
Mat
Fereder
'
,
but
a
'
cat
'
to
be
a
girl
,
you
may
want
,
'
the
cat
'
to
be
'
Fet
Kamaow
'
.
Consider
basing
your
language
on
an
existing
language
.
For
example
,
in
my
made
up
language
,
'
Vogelaviatiolap
'
means
Bird
.
If
you
have
n't
guessed
,
it
comes
from
the
following
:
'
Vogel
'
comes
from
German
,
which
means
bird
'
aviatio
'
comes
from
English
.
It
's
uncompleted
though
,
because
the
word
is
part
of
the
term
'
aviation
'
'
lap
'
comes
from
Onomatopoeia
.
It
's
a
completed
term
,
but
it
is
supposed
to
come
from
'
Flap
!
'
Consider
basing
some
of
your
words
from
other
words
you
have
invented
.
For
example
,
if
you
invented
the
word
'
China
'
as
'
Khinssa
'
,
'
Drink
'
as
'
Bever
'
,
and
the
word
'
Accident
'
as
'
Casnondelibreaten
'
,
why
not
make
the
word
'
tea
'
as
'
Khincasnonbever
'
or
'
Bevernondelibreatekin
'
or
even
'
Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever
'
!
Get
inspiration
from
existing
alphabets
and
words
.
Why
not
add
some
non
Latin
Characters
such
as
ß
?
You
can
even
make
the
whole
language
not
based
on
the
Latin
Alphabet
at
all
like
Chinese
!
You
can
even
take
some
words
of
languages
,
altering
them
or
not
.
You
can
make
the
word
'
pen
'
as
'
penn
'
or
even
'
pen
'
.
Using
the
dictionary
can
ensure
you
not
missing
a
single
word
.
Keep
track
of
all
your
Remember
to
write
down
your
creations
!
Use
your
language
.
Get
used
to
using
it
yourself
,
and
spread
it
to
others
.
Once
you
feel
confident
about
your
language
,
experiment
and
expand
:
Grab
a
book
/
novel
and
translate
it
to
your
own
language
.
Teach
your
friends
this
new
language
.
As
soon
as
your
friends
understand
your
language
,
communicate
to
them
with
it
.
Be
fluent
in
your
own
made
up
language
and
start
spreading
this
to
your
friends
,
family
and
strangers
!
Write
your
own
poem
/
novel
/
story
with
your
own
made
up
language
.
If
you
're
really
ambitious
,
set
a
goal
of
helping
others
become
fluent
in
the
language
.
One
day
,
maybe
you
can
make
it
the
official
language
of
a
country
!
Tips
Make
sure
that
it
is
a
language
that
while
speaking
,
you
do
n't
get
a
literal
knot
in
your
tongue
!
Remember
you
should
know
how
to
write
it
.
For
example
we
write
it
from
left
to
right
,
in
Arabic
it
's
right
to
left
,
Chinese
is
in
columns
,
and
so
on
.
Make
sure
that
you
and
your
friend(s)
all
follow
a
systematic
language
system
.
In
other
words
,
make
sure
that
you
follow
the
same
guidelines
.
Do
n't
use
random
letters
.
It
should
make
some
sense
,
so
that
it
will
be
easier
to
learn
and
speak
with
[
Example
:
Do
n't
use
oh
as
e
,
hello
as
llo
,
and
See
ya
as
c
yah
)
.
Make
sure
you
practice
saying
and
spelling
out
many
basic
words
in
your
language
,
English
examples
:
is
,
who
,
when
,
of
,
why
,
if
,
what
,
where
,
can
,
may
,
etc
.
When
starting
off
,
follow
closely
to
a
language
you
like
.
This
will
make
grammar
much
easier
to
make
.
You
must
avoid
simply
copying
the
grammar
rules
,
however
,
as
this
would
technically
turn
your
language
into
a
code
.
Practice
your
language
frequently
so
that
you
do
n't
forget
it
!
Do
n't
forget
punctuation
!
As
a
shortcut
,
and
for
a
bit
of
interesting
background
,
add
connotation
to
various
letters
,
preferably
vowels
.
To
do
this
,
think
of
various
words
that
begin
with
/
have
a
lot
of
a
certain
vowel
.
For
example
:
austere
,
acrimony
,
ebullient
,
embolden
;
in
this
case
,
the
vowel
A
might
carry
with
it
a
negative
meaning
,
whereas
E
would
be
positive
.
Then
,
even
if
you
forget
your
own
words
without
the
help
of
your
dictionary
,
you
could
still
make
a
good
guess
based
on
the
composition
of
the
letters
.
Try
not
to
make
your
words
sound
like
utter
and
complete
gibberish
just
add
a
little
extra
than
our
regular
English
language
.
We
do
n't
want
a
knot
in
your
tongue
after
speaking
to
your
friends
.
Just
put
marks
over
the
letters
or
make
up
something
right
on
the
spot
,
you
might
have
to
take
some
time
on
this
!
Basing
letters
on
objects
(
pictographs
)
is
an
easy
way
to
start
a
writing
system
.
Try
this
with
a
group
of
friends
.
It
's
much
more
fun
when
there
are
other
people
that
can
understand
your
language
.
Email
or
text
your
friends
the
language
so
that
they
wo
n't
be
so
confused
.
When
making
a
writing
system
,
take
a
break
about
every
five
minutes
and
come
back
to
it
or
all
your
letters
will
begin
to
look
identical
.
If
you
want
to
make
other
languages
,
you
can
use
this
language
as
a
model
and
change
some
letters
or
sounds
to
create
a
different
language
.
This
makes
your
first
language
a
proto-language
—
a
language
that
branches
off
into
a
family
of
languages
.
How
to
Pack
Your
Possessions
When
Moving
Even
if
you
ca
n't
wait
to
live
in
your
new
house
,
curb
your
enthusiasm
and
resist
the
urge
to
cram
all
your
possessions
any
which
way
into
boxes
.
Steps
Pack
one
room
at
a
time
if
possible
,
and
start
with
items
that
are
least
often
used
.
Write
down
a
list
of
everything
you
are
packing
,
in
particular
if
it
's
valuable
.
Books
,
CDs
,
expensive
clothes
.
Also
,
take
note
of
which
item
is
in
which
box
.
Use
sturdy
boxes
.
Fill
the
box
to
the
brim
and
seal
the
lid
.
That
way
,
you
can
easily
stack
boxes
on
top
of
one
another
.
Tape
the
bottom
of
the
box
securely
so
that
it
does
n't
give
way
.
Never
fill
a
box
until
it
is
so
heavy
that
you
ca
n't
lift
it
safely
.
Spread
the
heavy
items
over
a
few
boxes
.
Balance
boxes
with
lighter
items
like
towels
or
soft
toys
.
Pack
the
lighter
items
on
top
.
Use
bubble
wrap
or
newspapers
when
packing
fragile
items
.
However
,
newsprint
may
smudge
so
use
newspaper
selectively
.
Clean
paper
can
be
purchased
cheaply
from
moving
supply
stores
.
Mark
boxes
.
Boxes
should
be
marked
"
Fragile
"
and
"
This
side
up
"
to
prevent
mishandling
.
Label
each
box
clearly
and
which
room
it
belongs
to
.
Write
on
the
sides
of
the
box
as
well
.
Pack
a
separate
box
of
essentials
you
may
need
for
the
first
night
at
your
new
house
.
Include
items
like
toiletries
,
toilet
paper
,
bottled
water
,
snacks
and
a
change
of
clothes
in
case
you
can
not
unpack
everything
in
time
.
Tips
Do
n't
label
boxes
with
contents
if
the
contents
are
valuable
.
Instead
of
writing
"
Silver
Service
-
Fragile
"
you
should
write
something
that
makes
it
sound
less
theft
inviting
while
showing
the
fragile
nature
of
the
contents
.
Example
:
"
Mom
's
old
dishes
"
instead
of
"
Fine
China
"
Tape
is
cheap
.
Use
lots
of
it
.
Close
box
bottoms
well
.
Get
masking
tape
or
packing
tape
and
tape
screws
and
other
little
things
that
came
out
of
something
back
against
it
.
You
'll
want
to
find
the
right
screw
reassemble
something
without
having
to
pick
it
out
of
100
others
when
you
get
there
.
Do
n't
pack
one
box
full
of
books
or
paperwork
-
you
might
not
be
able
to
carry
it
at
all
.
Fill
it
halfway
with
books
,
and
fill
it
up
with
lighter
stuff
.
National
superstores
(
Walmart
)
will
let
you
walk
the
store
for
boxes
when
they
are
stocking
the
stores
between
11
pm
and
1
am
.
You
can
find
boxes
of
all
sizes
.
Cereal
,
diaper
and
houseware
boxes
are
a
good
size
and
durable
.
Just
take
a
cart
and
roam
the
store
.
They
do
check
the
cart
as
you
leave
so
do
n't
try
to
sneak
anything
past
them
.
U-haul
and
other
nation
companies
offer
box
buy
back
services
.
If
you
buy
too
many
boxes
you
can
return
the
unused
for
a
full
refund
.
These
boxes
are
also
quite
sturdy
so
you
can
re-use
them
or
stash
in
your
attic
until
you
move
again
.
Some
national
companies
even
offer
free
shipping
and
handling
so
you
can
have
some
delivered
or
go
to
the
local
location
.
Fill
empty
spaces
with
additional
paper
.
Throw
away
or
donate
junk
you
do
n't
want
to
take
to
your
new
place
.
Do
n't
pack
it
again
!
!
!
Set
aside
an
area
of
the
house
where
you
can
put
all
the
packed
boxes
.
Use
a
room
that
is
n't
used
every
day
such
as
the
formal
dining
or
living
room
.
You
wo
n't
be
tripping
over
boxes
and
you
can
have
a
better
idea
of
what
you
have
and
where
things
are
.
Pack
books
and
heavy
items
into
smaller
boxes
.
Digital
Photos
-
use
your
camera
to
document
the
contents
of
boxes
.
How
to
Cope
With
a
Double
Parachute
Failure
While
skydiving
,
it
is
possible
(
yet
extremely
unlikely
)
that
both
your
primary
and
reserve
parachutes
will
malfunction
,
leaving
you
with
no
method
of
reducing
your
velocity
.
In
the
vast
majority
of
cases
,
this
will
not
occur
;
nevertheless
,
in
this
event
these
coping
strategies
may
assist
.
Steps
Remain
calm
.
This
may
seem
obvious
,
but
deep
,
even
breathing
(
despite
the
rushing
slipstream
)
and
controlling
your
heart-rate
are
essential
to
your
continued
survival
.
Entreat
assistance
.
If
both
your
primary
and
reserve
chutes
have
malfunctioned
,
signal
immediately
to
a
fellow
jumper
who
has
not
yet
deployed
their
chute
,
waving
your
arms
and
signalling
that
your
own
is
not
functional
.
If
this
is
a
solo
jump
,
then
skip
to
step
6
.
Prepare
for
deployment
.
After
linking
arms
with
your
fellow
jumper
,
you
will
need
to
hook
your
arms
through
their
chest
strap
,
or
through
both
sides
of
the
front
of
their
harness
,
as
far
as
you
can
,
then
grab
onto
your
own
strap
.
Deploy
.
The
shock
of
the
chute
deployment
will
be
intense
.
The
G-forces
will
multiply
your
body
weight
,
making
it
impossible
to
hold
on
;
this
is
why
hooking
your
arms
through
the
harness
is
essential
.
It
is
likely
that
the
shock
will
dislocate
or
break
both
your
arms
;
nevertheless
this
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
your
life
.
Prepare
for
impact
.
If
your
companion
's
canopy
has
successfully
opened
,
then
both
your
chances
of
survival
have
dramatically
increased
.
With
a
large
and
slow
canopy
,
your
chances
are
even
better
.
The
canopy
must
be
steered
away
from
power
lines
and
similar
obstructions
;
try
for
a
large
body
of
water
if
you
are
confident
your
companion
can
save
you
from
drowning
.
Alternative
:
Lack
of
companions
If
this
is
a
solo
jump
,
which
constitutes
the
minority
of
skydivers
,
your
only
recourse
is
to
ensure
that
at
least
one
of
your
own
chutes
opens
.
In
this
case
,
the
excellent
advice
offered
by
your
instructors
on
assisting
chute
opening
may
be
of
assistance
to
you
.
If
it
becomes
apparent
that
you
cannot
open
either
of
your
two
parachutes
,
or
that
for
some
other
reason
they
are
fatally
non-functional
,
then
the
following
steps
may
be
of
some
minor
assistance
.
Appeal
.
If
you
are
of
a
religious
turn
of
mind
,
you
may
wish
at
this
point
to
offer
a
prayer
to
a
god
,
goddess
,
protective
spirit
or
guardian
angel
.
St
Jude
,
the
patron
saint
of
Lost
Causes
,
comes
to
mind
.
Objectively
,
this
is
not
likely
to
help
very
much
;
but
it
may
improve
your
emotional
state
.
If
you
do
not
have
any
religious
beliefs
,
or
are
for
another
reason
unwilling
to
appeal
to
your
patron
deity
,
skip
this
step
.
Contemplate
.
As
you
approach
the
Earth
at
,
or
close
to
,
terminal
velocity
,
you
may
wish
to
contemplate
your
past
existence
,
and
the
possibility
of
a
future
afterlife
.
A
strategy
that
might
prove
helpful
is
to
consider
how
fortunate
you
are
that
life
has
been
good
to
you
so
far
.
Alternatively
,
if
life
has
not
been
good
to
you
so
far
,
(
and
considering
your
current
situation
this
seems
more
likely
)
consider
how
lucky
you
are
that
it
will
not
be
troubling
you
much
longer
.
Expect
impact
.
You
are
unlikely
to
have
the
time
or
ability
to
aim
for
a
soft
landing-spot
,
body
of
water
,
or
other
impact
site
that
might
improve
your
chances
of
survival
.
There
is
a
minuscule
chance
that
your
impact
will
result
in
non-life-threatening
injuries
;
if
this
seems
incredibly
far-fetched
,
comfort
yourself
that
double
chute
failure
in
modern
times
is
also
extremely
unlikely
,
and
that
you
have
already
beaten
worse
odds
.
Tips
Your
reserve
chute
should
have
been
packed
by
a
certified
rigger
and
is
moderately
less
likely
to
fail
;
therefore
,
it
may
be
helpful
to
focus
your
efforts
on
opening
your
reserve
parachute
.
Some
humans
who
have
,
for
various
reasons
,
become
aware
of
their
impending
death
,
develop
psychological
coping
strategies
to
deal
with
this
;
for
instance
,
the
Kubler-Ross
phases
of
grief
.
Since
your
own
death
approaches
far
more
quickly
,
this
is
unlikely
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
.
Warnings
Water
landings
:
if
you
have
successfully
attached
to
a
companion
whose
chute
opens
,
keep
in
mind
that
both
your
arms
may
be
broken
or
dislocated
,
and
you
may
be
unable
to
swim
or
tread
water
before
your
chute
fills
and
drags
you
under
.
If
,
after
total
chute
failure
,
you
land
on
something
soft
,
it
is
possible
that
instead
of
being
killed
outright
,
you
may
be
permanently
paralyzed
due
to
spinal
injury
.
If
you
have
a
strong
aversion
to
this
outcome
,
aiming
head-downward
before
impact
in
the
manner
of
an
Olympic
diver
may
ensure
the
destruction
of
your
cranium
and
your
immediate
demise
.
How
to
Stop
Procrastinating
If
you
're
a
chronic
procrastinator
,
you
know
the
pain
and
stress
that
comes
with
putting
things
off
.
Although
you
may
have
the
desire
to
accomplish
something
,
getting
the
motivation
to
do
it
is
a
different
matter
.
Fortunately
,
overcoming
your
procrastination
is
easy
to
do
when
you
put
your
mind
to
it
.
Side
note
:
If
you
have
anything
due
right
now
,
and
you

it
,

complete
that
work
.
Steps
Create
a
to-do
list
.
Yes
,
make
yourself
an
old
fashioned
to-do
list
with
check
boxes
and
everything
.
List
everything
,
big
and
small
,
that
you
have
to
do
for
your
entire
day
;
break
big
activities
into
smaller
bits
if
necessary
.
Then
,
as
you
work
through
your
day
,
check
off
each
of
the
items
on
your
list
.
You
will
feel
a
growing
sense
of
pride
as
you
visually
monitor
your
ever-diminishing
list
of
projects
.
Focus
your
list
on
including
the
things
you
typically
put
off
,
not
the
things
you
are
sure
to
do
on
a
regular
basis
.
If
necessary
,
set
time-frames
for
your
items
to
be
done
by
.
For
example
,
list
“
take
the
dog
for
a
walk
by
12:30
”
rather
than
simply
“
walk
the
dog
.
”
Re-evaluate
your
list
halfway
through
your
day
to
rank
your
items
based
on
highest
priority
.
Then
,
tackle
the
most
important
ones
before
looking
back
at
the
smaller
things
to
do
.
Keep
a
notebook
by
hand
before
you
start
your
workday
.
Write
every
thought
down
that
comes
up
during
work
.
Every
single
to
do
or
things
you
want
to
do
at
that
specific
moment
.
Do
n't
do
it
,
put
it
on
a
list
and
do
it
later
.
This
prevents
you
from
getting
into
the
"
procrastination
zone
.
"
Finish
the
hard
stuff
.
When
you
have
a
looming
project
that
's
bogging
you
down
and
making
you
unproductive
in
other
areas
,
tackle
it
first
.
Finishing
the
largest
item
on
your
list
of
things
to
do
will
make
you
feel
extra
productive
and
give
you
the
boost
to
do
other
things
you
’ve
been
pushing
to
the
side
.
If
your
“
big
project
”
is
something
that
ca
n’t
be
done
in
one
sitting
,
make
a
list
of
small
parts
of
it
that
you
can
accomplish
today
.
Do
n’t
worry
about
completing
the
entire
thing
,
but
take
steps
now
so
that
doing
so
in
the
future
is
a
breeze
.
Make
an
ultimate
to-do
list
for
this
single
project
,
and
have
it
placed
somewhere
you
will
see
it
on
a
regular
basis
.
As
you
mark
things
off
,
you
will
be
motivated
to
continue
doing
so
,
and
seeing
it
on
a
regular
basis
will
remind
you
that
your
project
needs
to
be
done
.
Do
two-minute
tasks
.
Whenever
you
are
presented
with
something
that
you
do
n’t
want
to
do
or
would
consider
putting
off
,
ask
yourself
,
“
will
this
take
me
less
than
two
minutes
to
finish
?
”
For
many
of
us
,
this
includes
small
chores
,
like
taking
out
the
trash
or
pulling
a
few
weeds
,
but
can
include
simple
tasks
in
all
areas
of
life
.
Anything
that
you
want
to
put
off
but
takes
two
minutes
to
do
-
do
it
.
Simply
force
yourself
to
use
the
next
120
seconds
to
be
productive
and
do
the
duty
you
normally
would
push
off
for
hours
or
days
.
[

.
Create
a
timed
work
frenzy
.
If
you
find
yourself
being
pulled
off
into
the
depths
of
daydreams
,
set
a
period
of
time
to
do
nothing
but
work
.
Take
ten
minutes
and
remove
all
distractions
-
your
phone
,
magazines
,
or
thoughts
of
your
attractive
love
-
and
go
into
a
working
frenzy
.
Force
yourself
to
work
productively
for
ten
minutes
,
and
then
go
back
to
whatever
it
was
you
were
doing
.
Chances
are
,
you
’ll
get
into
a
groove
and
keep
working
at
a
high
pace
even
when
your
frenzy
time
is
out
.
Working
with
a
timer
is
generally
regarded
by
most
experts
as
being
one
of
the
best
ways
to
develop
self-discipline
and
stop
procrastination
.
The
most
famous
method
of
working
to
strict
time
controls
(
known
as
time-boxing
)
involves
creating
a
list
of
tasks
.
Each
task
is
then
assigned
an
exact
amount
of
time
to
complete
.
If
you
do
n't
finish
the
task
in
the
allotted
time
,
then
you
move
on
to
the
next
one
.
Using
this
work
arrangement
,
it
forces
you
to
take
action
,
as
you
ca
n't
afford
to
waste
any
time
.
[

]
.
Give
yourself
a
break
.
If
you
ca
n’t
seem
to
focus
and
are
working
half-heartedly
at
your
tasks
,
give
yourself
a
brief
break
.
Set
a
timer
for
ten
minutes
,
and
take
a
nap
,
read
a
book
,
or
call
your
friend
.
Do
whatever
it
is
you
’ve
been
daydreaming
about
so
that
the
temptation
is
removed
once
you
get
back
to
work
.
Just
be
sure
to
follow
through
with
your
deadline
rather
than
ignoring
it
when
your
alarm
finally
goes
off
.
How
to
Play
Muggle
Quidditch
In
the
Harry
Potter
series
written
by
JK
Rowling
the
main
wizarding
sport
is
Quidditch
.
However
you
do
n't
have
to
have
magical
powers
to
play
.
There
are
many
different
ways
of
playing
Quidditch
,
but
the
most
commonly
used
set
of
rules
are
those
given
by
the
International
Quidditch
Association
(
which
can
be
found
here
)
.
In
the
past
Muggle
Quidditch
has
mainly
been
played
at
colleges
in
the
US
,
but
over
the
last
few
years
there
has
been
a
dramatic
rise
in
the
number
of
community
teams
.
Quidditch
has
also
spread
outside
of
America
and
is
now
played
on
5
continents
.
Steps
Gather
all
needed
materials
and
players
(
see
Things
You
'll
Need
section
below
)
.
Know
that
all
players
can
play
while
riding
a
broom
.
Brooms
can
be
a
hindrance
however
,
so
feel
free
to
not
use
brooms
.
Place
the
quaffle
and
three
bludgers
in
the
middle
of
the
field
.
Ideally
the
quaffle
and
bludgers
should
be
slightly
deflated
so
that
they
are
easier
to
throw
and
catch
.
Start
the
game
.
Both
teams
start
from
the
edges
and
attempt
to
obtain
the
quaffle
and
bludgers
.
Follow
your
duty
depending
what
type
of
player
you
are
:
Chasers
try
to
score
by
throwing
the
quaffle
into
one
of
the
three
goal
hoops
.
Each
score
is
worth
10
points
.
Beaters
try
to
peg
players
with
their
bludger
.
If
a
player
is
pegged
they
have
to
stop
what
they
're
doing
and
pay
a
penalty
;
i.e.
(
drop
the
quaffle
in
the
case
of
a
chaser
)
and
run
back
to
and
touch
their
goal
post
or
alternatively
sit
down
for
10
seconds
.
Keepers
guard
the
goal
posts
at
each
end
and
attempt
to
block
chasers
'
attempts
at
scoring
.
If
Keeper
is
close
to
their
hoops
they
are
safe
from
being
hit
by
bludgers
.
Seekers
try
to
tackle
the
snitch
(
a
person
)
or
obtain
an
object
attached
to
the
snitch
such
as
a
sock
or
flag
.
You
can
establish
you
own
rules
as
to
how
a
player
catches
the
snitch
.
A
common
way
to
play
is
to
make
the
snitch
a
person
,
and
give
the
snitch
a
head
start
to
run
and
hide
in
defined
boundaries
.
Then
the
seekers
search
for
the
snitch
,
and
attempt
to
tag
the
player
.
Other
methods
,
such
as
the
method
adopted
in
2005
,
makes
the
snitch
a
tennis
ball
in
a
sock
,
hanging
out
of
the
running
shorts
of
the
snitch
runner
.
Regardless
of
method
,
the
winning
seeker
wins
30
points
for
his
or
her
team
,
unlike
the
books
,
in
which
the
snitch
is
worth
150
points
.
The
creators
of
Muggle
Quidditch
thought
that
it
was
worth
too
many
points
so
changed
the
value
of
the
snitch
for
muggle
Quidditch
.
The
snitch
,
generally
a
track
runner
,
runs
around
(
usually
the
boundaries
)
trying
to
evade
the
seekers
.
The
referee
should
ensure
that
rules
are
being
followed
.
They
also
keep
track
of
the
score
.
Play
the
game
!
The
object
of
the
game
is
to
score
the
most
points
and
the
game
ends
when
the
seeker
snatches
the
snitch
.
Feel
free
to
alter
the
game
rules

the
Tips

How
to
Play
a
Real-Life
Game
of
Quidditch
You
do
n't
need
flying
broomsticks
or
magic
balls
to
play
this
version
of
the
game
-
it
's
tailor-made
for
muggles
like
us
.
This
video
shows
a
more
realistic
approach
to
playing
Quidditch
.
Tips
Alternatively
the
snitch
can
be
a
small
yellow
ball
(
tennis
balls
work
great
)
that
is
hidden
before
the
game
starts
by
a
bystander
or
referee
.
Establish
boundaries
and
have
the
seekers
look
for
the
snitch
.
Beaters
can
try
hitting
the
bludgers
around
in
the
air
with
a
shortened
hockey
sticks
or
a
short
bat
.
They
could
also
use
regular-length
hockey
sticks
to
hit
bludgers
(
perhaps
wiffle
balls
)
on
the
ground
.
The
simplest
way
is
to
just
peg
players
by
throwing
dodge
balls
.
It
may
be
easier
to
play
without
brooms
(
but
also
less
fun
!
)
.
Remember
that
the
snitch
runner
,
if
you
choose
to
use
one
,
is
not
an
actual
player
in
the
game
,
therefore
,
not
bound
by
any
of
the
rules
.
If
desired
,
the
snitch
is
able
to
do
whatever
he
or
she
wants
to
avoid
capture
.
See
How
to
Be
a
Snitch
in
Quidditch
for
more
information
.
You
can
play
water
quidditch
in
a
pool
.
Almost
all
the
same
rules
apply
.
Have
someone
throw
something
(
the
snitch
)
on
a
line
into
the
pool
at
regular
intervals
.
They
can
even
use
fake
snitches
.
You
can
buy
authentic
looking
brooms
to
make
the
game
more
realistic
.
There
is
a
very
large
Quidditch
community
,
have
a
look
at
the
IQA
website
to
find
teams
near
you
.
One
variation
is
Quarter
Snitch
Quidditch
.
Find
a
quarter
or
another
small
coin
.
Have
both
of
the
teams
turn
around
and
have
the
referee
throw
it
into
the
grass
or
pitch
while
the
teams
are
n't
looking
.
Play
while
the
seekers
look
for
the
snitch
.
Another
variation
is
where
the
referee
places
the
snitch
somewhere
in
the
field
(
in
this
case
it
's
a
small
ball
)
.
The
seeker
has
to
find
the
snitch
blindfolded
,
relying
only
on
the
coach
's
instructions
,
while
the
game
is
still
on
.
Warnings
Stay
hydrated
and
exercise
wisely
.
A
ball
flying
in
the
air
can
hurt
.
If
you
're
playing
quidditch
you
're
probably
just
having
fun
so
play
nicely
.

How
to
Prepare
Quinoa
Quinoa
is
known
as
the
little
rice
of
Peru
.
The
Incas
treated
the
crop
as
sacred
and
referred
to
quinoa
as
"
chisaya
mama
"
or
"
mother
of
all
grains
.
"
[
1
]
By
tradition
,
the
Inca
emperor
would
sow
the
first
seeds
of
the
season
using
"
golden
implements
.
"
Quinoa
is
rich
in
protein
and
much
lighter
than
other
grains
.
It
is
much
easier
to
prepare
than
rice
and
is
rapidly
gaining
in
popularity
,
especially
among
vegetarians
who
value
its
high
protein
levels
.
Ingredients
1
cup
quinoa
2
cups
water
(
or
broth
)
Olive
oil
to
taste
(
Optional
)
1/2
teaspoon
salt
(
Optional
)
Method
1
Cooking
On
A
Stove
Top
Rinse
the
grains
of
quinoa
in
water
.
You
can
skip
this
step
if
you
have
purchased
pre-rinsed
quinoa
in
a
box
.
To
rinse
,
place
the
measured
grain
in
a
strainer
under
running
water
for
a
few
minutes
.
This
is
necessary
to
remove
the
excess
saponins
on
the
outside
of
the
grains
which
impart
a
bitter
flavor
to
quinoa
if
not
removed
.
Toast
quinoa
in
a
saucepan
(
optional
)
.
Drizzle
a
bit
of
olive
oil
in
a
pan
over
medium-high
heat
.
Add
the
quinoa
and
cook
for
about
1
minute
.
This
brings
out
quinoa
's
nutty
flavor
.
Cook
the
quinoa
.
Place
two
parts
water
or
stock
to
one
part
of
quinoa
in
a
saucepan
over
medium-high
heat
and
bring
to
a
boil
.
Cover
and
reduce
heat
to
low
.
Simmer
the
quinoa
for
about
15
minutes
or
until
the
grain
becomes
translucent
and
the
white
germ
forms
a
visible
spiral
on
the
exterior
of
the
quinoa
grain
.
Try
to
ensure
there
is
an
al
dente
bite
to
the
germ
,
in
the
same
way
as
pasta
.
Quinoa
will
continue
cooking
for
a
bit
even
after
you
take
it
off
the
heat
.
Take
the
quinoa
off
the
heat
and
let
stand
,
covered
,
for
5
minutes
.
This
will
give
it
time
to
absorb
any
moisture
that
might
still
be
in
the
pan
.
Uncover
and
fluff
with
a
fork
.
The
quinoa
should
look
light
and
fluffy
,
and
you
should
be
able
to
see
the
germ
separating
from
the
seed
.
Serve
.
Freshly
cooked
quinoa
should
be
served
immediately
to
retain
nutritional
value
and
a
good
flavor
.
Serve
with
:
Stir-fry
,
using
the
quinoa
as
a
substitute
for
rice
.
Curry
.
Braised
meat
.
In
a
salad
.
Virtually
any
other
combination
you
can
think
of
!
Method
2
Cooking
In
a
Rice
Cooker
Rinse
1
cup
of
quinoa
in
a
fine
mesh
sieve
under
cold
water
.
If
you
bought
packaged
quinoa
,
this
step
is
n't
always
necessary
,
but
it
's
better
to
be
safe
than
sorry
.
Pour
quinoa
into
rice
cooker
.
One
option
is
to
toast
the
quinoa
before
placing
in
the
rice
cooker
.
See

cooker
.
Water
,
chicken
stock
or
broth
,
or
vegetable
stock
all
work
.
Cook
for
approximately
15
minutes
.
Some
rice
cooker
will
have
different
settings
instead
of
a
simple
"
cook
"
option
.
Try
the
"
white
rice
"
option
if
your
rice
cooker
gives
you
several
options
.
Let
stand
for
about
5
minutes
.

About
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
Some
of
the
content
in
this
topic
may
not
be
applicable
to
some
languages
.
You
can
create
SQL
queries
in
one
of
two
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
:
ANSI-89
describes
the
traditional
Jet
SQL
syntax
.
This
mode
conforms
closely
to
the
ANSI-89
Level
1
specification
,
but
is
not
ANSI-89
Level
1
compliant
.
Certain
ANSI-89
SQL
features
are
not
implemented
and
the
wildcard
characters
conform
to
the
Visual
Basic
for
Applications
(
VBA
)
specification
,
not
SQL
.
ANSI-92
provides
new
reserved
words
,
syntax
rules
,
and
wildcard
characters
that
enhance
your
ability
to
create
queries
,
filters
,
and
SQL
statements
.
This
mode
conforms
closely
to
the
ANSI-92
Level
1
specification
,
but
is
not
ANSI-92
Level
1
compliant
.
This
query
mode
has
more
of
the
ANSI
syntax
,
and
the
wildcard
characters
conform
to
the
SQL
specification
.
In
Microsoft
Access
2000
using
ADOX
,
you
could
programmatically
create
queries
that
used
ANSI-92
SQL
syntax
.
However
,
any
queries
you
created
were
not
visible
in
the
Database
window
because
there
was
no
option
to
set
this
mode
in
the
user
interface
.
Now
in
Access
2002
,
you
can
set
the
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
through
the
user
interface
for
the
current
database
and
as
the
default
setting
for
new
databases
.
Why
use
ANSI-92
SQL
?
You
may
want
to
use
ANSI-92
SQL
for
the
following
reasons
:
You
anticipate
upsizing
your
application
in
the
future
to
an
Access
project
and
want
to
create
queries
that
will
run
with
minimal
changes
in
a
Microsoft
SQL
Server
database
.
You
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
features
not
found
in
ANSI-89
SQL
,
such
as
:
Changing
security
settings
by
using
the
GRANT
and
REVOKE
SQL
statements
Using
DISTINCT
in
an
aggregate
function
reference
,
for
example
,
SUM-DISTINCT-Price
Using
the
LIMIT
TO
nn
ROWS
clause
to
limit
the
number
of
rows
returned
by
a
query
Why
you
should
avoid
mixing
queries
created
under
different
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
The
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
default
for
new
Access
databases
in
2002
and
2000
file
formats
ANSI-89
is
the
default
setting
for
a
new
Access
database
in
2002
and
2000
file
format
.
You
can
not
set
the
SQL
query
mode
new
database
default
to
ANSI-92
in
2000
file
format
because
the
option
is
disabled

About
using
connection
files
A
connection
file
stores
information
about
a
connection
to
a
data
source
(
such
as
an
OLE
DB
data
source
)
and
the
data
associated
with
the
connection
.
In
Microsoft
Access
,
you
can
use
a
connection
file
to
bind
one
or
more
data
access
pages
to
a
data
source
.
When
you
open
a
page
,
Access
reads
the
connection
file
that
is
linked
to
the
page
,
and
based
on
the
contents
of
the
connection
file
,
connects
the
page
to
the
appropriate
data
source
.
A
connection
file
uses
one
of
the
following
file
formats
:
Office
Data
Connection
(
.odc
)
A
file
format
that
uses
HTML
and
XML
to
store
the
connection
information
.
You
can
view
or
edit
the
contents
of
the
file
in
any
text
editor
.
Universal
Data
Link
(
.udl
)
A
standard
file
format
provided
by
Microsoft
Data
Links
to
create
file-persistent
OLE
DB
data
source
object
definitions
.
Benefits
of
using
a
connection
file
Using
a
connection
file
simplifies
the
task
of
deploying
related
data
access
pages
.
Pages
that
connect
to
a
common
data
source
can
share
a
single
connection
file
.
If
you
move
or
copy
the
data
source
,
instead
of
updating
the
ConnectionString
property
of
each
dependent
page
,
you
only
need
to
edit
the
connection
information
in
the
connection
file
to
make
the
pages
point
to
the
right
location
or
database
.
Linking
a
page
to
a
connection
file
When
creating
a
data
access
page
,
you
can
choose
whether
you
want
to
link
the
page
to
a
connection
file
or
simply
use
a
connection
file
without
creating
a
link
.
You
can
also
choose
whether
you
want
to
use
an
existing
connection
file
or
create
a
new
one
.
Linking
to
a
connection
file
When
you
establish
a
link
between
the
connection
file
and
a
page
,
the
page
's
ConnectionFile
property
is
set
to
the
name
of
the
file
.
Each
time
you
open
the
page
,
Access
will
read
the
connection
file
,
extract
the
connection
information
,
and
set
the
ConnectionString
property
of
the
page
.
Using
a
connection
file
without
creating
a
link
When
creating
a
page
,
you
can
use
the
contents
of
a
connection
file
to
set
the
ConnectionString
property
of
the
page
,
but
choose
not
to
create
a
link
between
the
page
and
the
connection
file
.
Changing
the
connection
information
of
a
page
When
a
connection
file
is
used
Either
change
the
ConnectionFile
property
of
the
page
to
point
to
a
different
connection
file
,
or
edit
the
connection
file
in
a
text
editor
.
If
you
choose
to
edit
the
connection
file
,
remember
that
all
other
pages
that
use
the
connection
file
will
also
be
affected
by
the
changes
you
make
.
If
you
edit
the
ConnectionString
property
of
a
page
that
is
linked
to
a
connection
file
,
the
link
will
be
broken
and
the
ConnectionFile
property
will
be
set
to
null
.
When
a
connection
file
is
not
used
Either
create
a
link
between
the
page
and
a
connection
file
by
setting
the
ConnectionFile
property
,
or
edit
the
ConnectionString
property
.
When
you
create
a
link
,
Access
will
automatically
set
the
ConnectionString
property
based
on
the
contents
of
the
connection
file
.
Convert
a
previous-version
data
access
page
A
page
created
using
Microsoft
Access
2000
must
be
converted
before
it
can
be
used
with
Access
2002
.
Open
the
page
in
Access
2002
Design
view
.
Access
will
create
a
backup
copy
of
the
page
(
pagefilename.bak.htm
)
at
the
same
location
as
the
original
data
access
page
file
.
If
you
want
to
revert
to
the
Access
2000
version
of
the
page
,
delete
the
converted
file
,
rename
the
backup
copy
,
and
then
connect
the
page
to
the
database
.
If
the
data
access
page
includes
any
Microsoft
Office
Web
Components
(
a
PivotTable
list
,
chart
,
or
spreadsheet
)
,
only
users
with
a
valid
Microsoft

license
will
be
able
to
use
those
components
.
About
analyzing

.
Create
a
crosstab
query
You
can
use
a
crosstab
query
to
calculate
and
restructure
data
for
easier
analysis
.
Crosstab
queries
calculate
a
sum
,
average
,
count
,
or
other
type
of
total
for
data
that
is
grouped

of
a
PivotTable
view
You
can
control
how
the
data
is
presented
in

,
the
unique
items
of
data
are
displayed
across
the
columns
.
Moving
fields
to
the
detail
area
To
view
total
or
detail
data
from
the
underlying
record
source
,
move
fields
to
the
detail
area
.
Moving
fields
to
the
filter
area
Filter
fields
allow
you
to
confine
the
view
to
a
particular
part
of
the
available
data
.
For
example
,
when
you
move
a
Product
field
to
the
filter
area
,
you
can
display
data
for
one
product
at
a
time
.
Moving
row
or
column
fields
to
a
higher
or
lower
level
When
a
view
has
multiple
row
and
column
fields
,
the
fields
that
are
closest
to
the
detail
data
are
referred
to
as
inner
fields
.
The
other
fields
are
outer
fields
.
You
can
switch
the
inner
and
outer
fields
.
Example
of
inner
and
outer
row
fields
2
Outer
row
field
2
Inner
row
field
3
Outer
field
items
4
Items
for
the
inner
field
are
repeated
for
each
item
in
the
outer
field
.
Adding
and
removing
fields
The
layout
of
a
PivotTable
view
does
not
have
to
include
all
of
the
fields
that
are
available
from
the
underlying
record
source
.
You
can
also
remove
fields
that
you
no
longer
want
to
see
from
the
PivotTable
view
layout
.
Customizing
the
layout
of
a
PivotChart
view
You
change
the
layout
of
a
chart
by
moving
the
fields
to
predefined
drop
areas
within
the
chart
workspace
.
To
do
this
,
drop
areas
must
be
shown
in
the
chart
.
Drop
areas
are
displayed
differently
depending
on
the
chart
type
.
For
example
,
a
series
drop
area
is
not
displayed
for
a
pie
chart
because
pie
charts
consist
of
only
one
series
.
Additionally
,
it
is
written
in
a
style
similar
to
an
XML
document
using
a
combination
of
XML-like
tags
and
HTML
to
create
a
template
for
a
specific
style
of
output
.
Note
that
you
are
not
required
to
link
either
a
CSS
file
or
an
XSL
style
sheet
to
an
XML
document
in
order
for
Internet
Explorer
5
(
and
later
versions
)
to
display
the
document
.
Internet
Explorer
has
a
default
,
built-in
style
sheet
that
displays
the
XML
source
as
a
(collapsible|expandable)
tree
.
You
can
use
style
sheets
to
insure
that
the
XML-based
Web
pages
on
your
intranet
or
Website
are
consistent
and
present
a
uniform
appearance
without
having
to
add
HTML
to
each
page
.

Language
Transformation
(
XSLT
)
XSL
for
Transformation
(
XSLT
)
is
a
specification
that
is
currently
under
development
by
the
World
Wide
Web
Consortium
(
W3C
)
,
and
supported
by
Access
.
XSLT
is
an
XML-based
language
that
allows
one
XML
document
to
be
mapped
,
or
transformed
,
into
another
XML
document
.
This
provides
a
way
of
transforming
an
XML
document
's
presentation
information
from
a
source
format
to
a
target
format
and
back
again
.
Typically
,
a
developer
creates
an
XSL
transformation
file
that
,
when
applied
to
an
XML
document
during
export
,
interprets
or
transforms
the
XML
data
into
a
presentation
format
that
can
be
recognized
by
another
application
,
such
as
Service
Advertising
Protocol
(
SAP
)
or
a
custom
purchase
order
format
.
XSLT
has
many
of
the
constructs
(
structures
and
commands
)
found
in
other
programming
languages
which
allow
the
developer
to
use
variables
,
loops
and
iterations
,
and
conditional
statements
.
This
gives
the
developer
considerable
control
over
the
output
of
the
XML
data
.
About
exporting
to
XML
files
Exporting
data
and
database
objects
to
an
XML
file
is
a
convenient
way
to
move
and
store
your
information
in
a
format
that
can
readily
be
used
across
the
Web
.
In
Access
,
you
can
export
the
data
,
the
schema
(
data
structure
)
,
or
both
,
to
XML
files
.
Export
data
to
an
XML
file
and
,
optionally
,
use
an
XSLT
to
transform
the
data
to
another
format
.
Export
the
data
schema
using
XML
Schema
standard
(
XSD
)
.
Export
the
data
behind
forms
and
reports
to
an
XML
file
.
You
can
also
transform
the
data
to
another
presentation
format
using
an
Extensible
Style
Language
(
XSL
)
file
during
the
export
process
.
You
can
export
tables
,
queries
,
and
the
data
behind
forms
or
reports
from
a
Microsoft
Access
database
(
.mdb
)
as
well
as
tables
,
views
,
stored
produces
,
functions
,
and
the
data
behind
forms
and
reports
from
a
Microsoft
Access
project
(
.adp
)
.
Exporting
tables
,
queries
,
views
,
datasheets
,
forms
or
reports
You
can
export
a
database
object
as
an
XML
document
in
several
ways
:
You
can
export
just
the
data
from
a
table
,
query
,
datasheet
,
form
,
or
report
into
an
XML
file
.
This
data
is
saved
to
a
file
named
.xml
.
You
can
export
just
the
schema
(
data
structure
)
of
a
table
,
query
,
datasheet
,
form
,
or
report
to
an
XML
schema
file
.
An
XML
schema
file
is
a
formal
specification
of
the
rules
for
an
XML
document
,
providing
a
series
of
element
names
,
as
well
as
which
elements
are
allowed
in
the
document
and
in
what
combinations
.
If
you
select
to
save
the
schema
as
XSD
,
the
file
is
saved
as
.xsd
.
Note
When
you
export
a
table
to
an
XML
document
,
you
can
also
export
related
tables
.
For
example
,
if
you
export
a
table
of
Customers
Orders
,
you
can
also
choose
to
export
a
related
Orders
Details
table
and
Customers
table
into
the
same
file
.
If
selected
,
you
can
also
save
the
structure
of
a
table
,
query
,
datasheet
,
form
,
or
report
into
a
file
that
describes
the
presentation
and
connection
information
.
For
forms
and
reports
,
this
file
is
saved
in
an
XML-based
language
called
ReportML
which
provides
presentation
data
as
well
as
a
data
model
for
creating
a
data
access
page
.
For
tables
,
queries-views
,
and
datasheets
,
the
presentation
file
is
a
spreadsheet-like
template
.
This
file
is
saved
as
report.xml
.
In
addition
,
when
you
choose
to
save
the
data
as
XML
,
you
can
specify
that
the
data
be
transformed
to
a
custom
display
format
by
using
an
existing
.xsl
file
.
If
no
.xsl
file
is
specified
,
the
data
is
saved
in
standard
XML
format
.
Note
that
if
no
data
is
selected
for
export
then
a
presentation
format
is
also
unavailable
.
What
is
ReportML
?
ReportML
is
a
"
language
"
developed
by
Microsoft
and
specific
to
Access
which
can
be
used
to
describe
Access
database
objects
in
XML
.
The
ReportML
language
is
made
up
of
a
set
of
tags
that
describe
a
form
,
report
or
data
access
page
's
properties
,
events
,
and
attributes
.
When
you
export
data
from
Access
to
an
XML
file
,
you
choose
to
save
the
structure
of
a
form
or
report
into
a
ReportML
format
.
The
ReportML
file
can
be
used
to
convert
the
saved
data
into
a
data
access
page
.
Well-formed
documents
Any
XML
document
produced
by
Access
is
well-formed
,
which
means
that
it
conforms
to
the
basic
rules
of
XML
.
That
is
:
Each
XML
document
must
have
a
unique
root
element
(
an
element
encompassing
the
entire
document
)
.
All
start
and
end
tags
match
.
XML
tags
are
case-sensitive
.
For
each
start
tag
,
there
is
a
corresponding
end
tag
.
Empty
elements
can
be
denoted
by
a
special
shorthand
tag
.
Again
,
XML
tags
are
case-sensitive
.
Access
ReportML
will
not
write
out
any
empty
tags
.
Elements
do
not
overlap
.
In
other
words
,
start
and
end
tag
must
be
properly
nested
within
other
elements
.
Certain
reserve
characters
are
part
of
the
XML
syntax
and
will
not
be
interpreted
as
themselves
if
used
in
the
data
portion
of
an
element
.
You
need
to
substitute
a
special
character
sequence
(
called
an
"
entity
"
by
XML
)
as
follows
:
Character
Entity
The
following
is
an
example
of
a
well-formed
XML
document
:
where
:
is
a
declaration
that
states
that
this
is
an
XML
document
and
gives
the
version
number
.
The
declaration
is
optional
but
is
recommended
in
any
XML
document
.
is
the
root
element
which
encompasses
the
entire
document
.
is
a
start
tag
and
is
an
end
tag
which
together
describe
an
element
of
data
,
in
this
case
,
the
customer
's
name
.
Notice
that
each
tag
set
has
both
start
and
end
tags
and
is
case
sensitive
,
and
that
the
tag
sets
are
properly
nested
within
each
other
.
Also
notice
the
entity
&amp;apos;
which
will
be
transformed
to
an
apostrophe
when
the
data
is
imported
by
the
receiving
application
.
The
apostrophe
has
a
special
purpose
in
an
XML
document
and
can
be
misinterpreted
if
used
directly
in
the
text
.
The
converted
data
will
be
displayed
as
Mom
's
Boston
Crab
Meat
.
White
space
can
be
used
throughout
the
document
to
enhance
readability
.
If
a
schema
is
specified
while
exporting
from
Access
,
then
the
XML
documents
created
are
considered
to
be
valid
XML
documents
.
This
means
that
in
addition
to
being
well-formed
,
the
documents
conform
to
a
defined
schema
.
About
exporting
or
copying
a
PivotTable
view
to
Excel
or
other
applications
If
you
are
familiar
with
Microsoft
Excel
PivotTable
reports
and
want
to
work
with
the
data
in
Excel
,
there
are
two
ways
to
accomplish
this
.
Exporting
data
to
an
interactive
Excel
PivotTable
report
To
view
and
modify
the
contents
of
a
PivotTable
view
by
using
Excel
,
you
can
export
the
PivotTable
view
to
Excel
.
Preparing
for
export
to
Excel
Excel
PivotTable
reports
can
not
display
detail
fields
.
When
you
export
to
Excel
,
detail
fields
will
be
available
on
the
PivotTable
toolbar
in
Excel
,
but
the
fields
wo
n't
be
displayed
in
the
report
.
If
you
want
the
Excel
PivotTable
report
to
reflect
the
appearance
of
the
PivotTable
view
,
before
you
export
to
an
Excel
PivotTable
report
,
either
move
all
the
fields
out
of
the
detail
area
,
or
hide
detail
data
for
items
and
cells
so
that
the
detail
area
is
not
displayed
.
After
you
export
You
might
notice
some
differences
in
your
PivotTable
view
after
you
export
it
to
Excel
.
This
is
because
PivotTable
views
use
the
Microsoft
Office
PivotTable
Component
,
and
Excel
PivotTable
reports
either
do
not
support
certain
PivotTable
list
features
,
or
they
implement
some
features
differently
.
For
information
about
differences
between
PivotTable
lists
and
Excel
PivotTable
reports
,
see
Excel
Help
.
Copying
data
to
another
program
for
noninteractive
use
Copying
to
other
programs
You
can
also
copy
data
displayed
in
a
PivotTable
view
to
other
programs
,
such
as
Microsoft
FrontPage
.
When
you
copy
data
to
a
program
other
than
Excel
or
Word
that
does
not
support
the
HTML
format
used
by
PivotTable
views
,
the
data
is
copied
as
unformatted
text
.
About
filtering
data
in
PivotTable
view
You
can
use
the
filter
feature
to
find
specific
data
values
or
all
data
that
matches
a
value
.
Filtering
techniques
Filtering
a
field
(
Autofiltering
)
You
can
filter
fields
in
the
row
,
column
,
and
detail
areas
.
When
you
filter
a
field
,
you
select
one
or
more
items
of
data
in
the
field
that
you
want
to
view
,
and
hide
the
other
items
.
Filtered

First
,
the
Sport
field
is
filtered
to
display
only
Golf
sales
.
2
and
then
the
Quarter
field
is
filtered
to
display
only
Golf
sales
in
Qtr3
.
3
When
you
filter
a
field
,
the
drop-down
arrow
Field
arrow
for
the
filtered
field
changes
to
blue
instead
of
black
,
and
the
AutoFilter
button
on
the
toolbar
is
selected
.
Filtering
a
field
is
particularly
helpful
when
you
have
a
large
amount
of
source
data
but
you
want
to
focus
on
specific
areas
.
2
Category
field
Region
filtered
to
show
South
and
West
region
items
Conditional
filtering
You
can
apply
a
filter
to
a
series
or
category
field
to
show
the
top
or
bottom
n
items
based
on
a
total
.
For
example
,
you
can
filter
for
the
three
cities
that
generated
the
most
sales
or
the
five
products
that
are
least
profitable
.
Instead
of
n
items
,
you
can
also
choose
to
filter
for
a
certain
percentage
of
items
.
For
example
,
you
can
filter
for
the
top
25
%
or
bottom
25
%
of
salespeople
based
on
the
number
of
orders
handled
.
If
there
are
40
salespeople
,
after
the
filter
is
applied
,
you
will
see
data
for
10
people
.
When
you
filter
a
field
,
you
can
display
the
data
for
a
single
item
,
or
you
can
select
some
items
to
display
and
other
items
to
hide
.

)
You
can
filter
on
more
than
one
field
at
a
time
to
further
narrow
the
focus
.
Filtering
based
on
the
data
in
one
cell
(
Filter
by
Selection
)
You
can
filter
a
field
to
display
only
data
that
matches
the
value
in
a
selected
cell
.
Filtering
by
selection
is
particularly
useful
for
fields
in
the
detail
area
,
when
you
want
to
view
all
of
the
rows
that
contain
a
particular
value
.
Using
a
field
in
the
Filter
axis
You
can
also
filter
data
by
using
filter
fields
.
When
you
select
one
or
more
items
in
the
filter
field
,
the
data
that
's
displayed
and
calculated
in
the
entire
PivotTable
view
changes
to
reflect
those
items
.
You
can
add
new
filter
fields
or
move
existing
fields
to
the
filter
area
.

Rules
for
moving
an
interior
horizontal
line
If
you
move
the
line
upward
,
the
distance
between
the
moving
line
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
below
remains
constant
,
and
the
perpendicular
line
above
the
moving
line
contracts
.
If
you
move
the
line
downward
,
the
distance
between
the
moving
line
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
below
remains
constant
,
and
the
perpendicular
line
above
the
moving
line
lengthens
.
Rules
for
moving
an
exterior
line
If
you
are
moving
the
line
away
from
the
center
of
the
grid
,
the
nearest
parallel
line
does
n't
move
,
and
the
distance
between
the
line
you
are
moving
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
grows
larger
.
If
you
are
moving
the
line
towards
the
center
of
the
grid
,
the
nearest
parallel
line
does
n't
move
,
and
the
distance
between
the
line
you
are
moving
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
grows
smaller
.

values
in
calculations
The
aggregate
functions
wo
n't
include
records
containing
blank
(
Null
)
values
in
their
calculations
.
For
example
,
the
Count
function
returns
a
count
of
all
the
records
without
Null
values
.
If
you
want
to
find
the
total
number
of
records
including
those
with
Nullvalues
,
use
Count
with
the
wildcard
character
.
To
count
Null
values
when
using
the
other
aggregate
functions
,
use
the
Nz
function
,
which
converts
Null
values
to
zeroes
so
they
are
included
in
a
calculation
.
If
some
records
in
one
of
the
fields
you
used
in
the
expression
might
have
a
Null
value
,
you
can
convert
the
Null
value
to
zero
using
the
Nz
function
as
shown
in
the
following
example

using
Microsoft
Office
Web
Components
,
any
user
with
a
Microsoft
Office
2002
license
can
interact
with
the
components
in
the
browser
to
the
level
of
interactivity
you
provide
.
That
is
,
a
user
with

or
PivotTable
List
,
and
so
on
,
as
long
as
you
did
n't
protect
these

About
avoiding
the
mixing
of
queries
created
under
different
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
The
two
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
,
ANSI-89
and
ANSI-92
,
are
not
compatible
.
When
you
create
a
Microsoft
Access
database
,
you
need
to
decide
which
query
mode
you
are
going
to
use
,
because
mixing
queries
created
in
both
query
modes
could
produce
runtime
errors
or
unexpected
results
.
The
range
of
data
types
,
reserved
words
,
and
wildcard
characters
are
different
in
each
query
mode
.
Example
of
a
query
using
wildcard
characters
A
query
that
uses
wildcard
characters
in
a
criteria
expression
can
produce
different
results
under
each
query
mode
.
For
example
,
if
you
run
:
An
ANSI-89
SQL
query
in
a
database
set
to
ANSI-92
query
mode
,
such
as
:
SELECT
asterisk
FROM
Customers
WHERE
Country
Like
U
%
It
returns
all
customers
from
a
(country|region)
named
"
U
%
"
,
not
all
(countries|regions)
beginning
with
the
letter
"
U
"
,
because
the
percent
sign
(
%
)
is
not
a
wildcard
character
in
ANSI-89
SQL
.
Example
of
a
query
with
a
duplicate
field
and
alias
name
If
a
query
uses
an
alias
that
is
the
same
as
a
base
column
name
and
you
create
a
calculated
field
using
the
ambiguous
name
,
the
query
will
produce
different
results
under
each
query
mode
.
How
to
avoid
problems
caused
by
mixing
queries
under
different
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
in
the
same
database
In
general
,
avoid
doing
the
following
to
prevent
problems
caused
by
mixing
queries
created
under
different
ANSI
SQL
query
modes
:
Converting
an
Access
database
set
to
ANSI-92
SQL
query
mode
from
2002
file
format
to
2000
or
97
file
format
.
ANSI-92
SQL
query
mode
is
only
supported
in
the
2002
file
format
.
Changing
the
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
for
the
current
database
after
you
've
created
one
or
more
queries
.
If
you
must
do
this
,
retest
the
existing
queries
to
ensure
that
they
still
run
or
produce
expected
results
,
and
rewrite
the
queries
if
necessary
.
Importing
queries
created
under
one
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
into
an
Access
database
set
to
another
mode
,
or
exporting
queries
created
under
one
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
to
an
Access
database
set
to
another
mode
.
Changing
the
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
in
an
existing
application
.
This
could
break
your
application
and
require
rewriting
your
application
.
In
Access
2000
,
you
can
only
programmatically
change
the
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
and
any
queries
created
under
ANSI-92
mode
were
hidden
in
the
Database
window
.
In
Access
2002
,
you
or
a
user
can
change
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
through
the
user
interface
and
ANSI-92
queries
are
no
longer
hidden
in
the
Database
window
,
so
you
should
prevent
accidental
or
intentional
changes
to
the
ANSI
SQL
query
mode
of
your
application
by
protecting
your
code
and
preventing
the
changing
of
the
query
mode
through
the
application
's
user
interface
.
Using
ambiguous
aliases
and
column
names
.
To
avoid
confusion
,
ensure
that
aliases
and
column
names
are
always
unique
in
an
SQL
statement
.
About
how
Access
searches
for
reference
libraries
The
Visual
Basic
project
of
a
Microsoft
Access
file
contains
references
to
object
libraries
,
and
it
can
also
contain
references
to
other
files
,
including
other
Access
files
.
The
locations
of
referenced
files
are
specified
in
the
References
dialog
box
that
is
available
from
the
References
command
on
the
Tools
menu
in
the
Visual
Basic
Editor
.
When
you
open
an
Access
file
,
if
Access
does
n't
find
a
referenced
file
in
the
specified
location
,
it
searches
for
the
reference
as
follows
.
First
,
Access
searches
for
a
RefLibPaths
key
in
the
following
location
in
the
Microsoft
Windows
Registry
:
If
the
key
exists
,
Access
checks
for
the
existence
of
a
value
name
that
matches
the
name
of
the
referenced
file
.
If
it
finds
a
matching
value
name
,
Access
loads
the
reference
from
the
path
specified
in
the
corresponding
value
data
.
If
Access
does
n't
find
a
RefLibPaths
key
,
it
searches
for
the
referenced
file
in
the
locations
listed
below
in
the
following
order
:
Application
folder
containing
the
application
(
the
folder
where
Msaccess.exe
is
located
)
.
Current
folder
.
System
folders
(
the
System
and
System32
folders
located
in
the
Windows
or
WINNT
folder
)
.
PATH
environment
variable
.
For
more
information
about
environment
variables
,
see
Windows
Help
.
The
folder
that
contains
the
Access
file
,
and
any
subfolders
located
in
that
folder
.
If
Access
still
ca
n't
find
the
reference
after
performing
this
search
,
you
must
fix
the
reference
manually
.
About
saving
an
object
as
a
data
access
page
You
can
also
save
tables
,
views
,
stored
procedures
,
functions
,
and
forms
in
a
Microsoft
Access
project
as
a
data
access
page
.
Saving
an
object
as
a
data
access
page
enables
you
to
quickly
convert
an
object
into
a
page
,
and
allows
users
of
your
application
to
review
,
enter
,
and
analyze
data
over
the
Internet
or
an
intranet
.
For
example
,
if
you
have
a
sales
report
that
you
want
to
make
available
over
the
Web
,
instead
of
creating
a
data
access
page
and
customizing
it
to
look
like
the
sales
report
,
you
can
save
the
report
as
a
data
access
page
.
Using
the
Save
As
command
on
the
File
menu
will
save
a
data
access
page
that
is
similar
in
appearance
and
functionality
to
the
original
report
.
If
you
want
to
make
changes
to
the
design
of
the
resulting
page
,
you
can
open
the
page
in
Design
view
and
make
any
changes
you
want
.
The
default
view
–
the
view
in
which
the
object
is
open
when
you
carry
out
the
Save
As
command
–
determines
the
design
of
the
data
access
page
.
The
following
table
lists
the
outcome
of
each
view
.
Default
view
(
current
view
)

If
you
carry
out
the
Save
As
command
after
making
changes
to
the
object
's
formatting
,
but
before
saving
your
changes
,
the
current
formatting
–
not
the
saved
formatting
–
will
be
used
to
create
the

will
be
left

are
not
converted
when
you
carry

.
However
,
you
can
open
the
page
in
Design
view
and
create
additional
group
levels
to
make
the
page
appear
similar
to
the
original
object
.
Control
naming
Controls
on
forms
and
reports
need
not
have
unique
names
,
but
names
of
controls
on
a
page
must
be
unique
.
While
creating
the
page
,
Access
will
change
control
names
that
are
not
unique
.
Controls
in
the
header
and
footer
sections
Controls
in
the
Form
,
Report
,
or

About
sorting

in
PivotTable
or

view
It
was
a
wrong
number
that
started
it
,
the
telephone
ringing
three
times
in
the
dead
of
night
,
and
the
voice
on
the
other
end
asking
for
someone
he
was
not
.
Much
later
,
when
he
was
able
to
think
about
the
things
that
happened
to
him
,
he
would
conclude
that
nothing
was
real
except
chance
.
But
that
was
much
later
.
In
the
beginning
,
there
was
simply
the
event
and
its
consequences
.
Whether
it
might
have
turned
out
differently
,
or
whether
it
was
all
predetermined
with
the
first
word
that
came
from
the
stranger
's
mouth
,
is
not
the
question
.
The
question
is
the
story
itself
,
and
whether
or
not
it
means
something
is
not
for
the
story
to
tell
.
As
for
Quinn
,
there
is
little
that
need
detain
us
.
Who
he
was
,
where
he
came
from
,
and
what
he
did
are
of
no
great
importance
.
We
know
,
for
example
,
that
he
was
thirty-five
years
old
.
We
know
that
he
had
once
been
married
,
had
once
been
a
father
,
and
that
both
his
wife
and
son
were
now
dead
.
We
also
know
that
he
wrote
books
.
To
be
precise
,
we
know
that
he
wrote
mystery
novels
.
These
works
were
written
under
the
name
of
William
Wilson
,
and
he
produced
them
at
the
rate
of
about
one
a
year
,
which
brought
in
enough
money
for
him
to
live
modestly
in
a
small
New
York
apartment
.
Because
he
spent
no
more
than
five
or
six
months
on
a
novel
,
for
the
rest
of
the
year
he
was
free
to
do
as
he
wished
.
He
read
many
books
,
he
looked
at
paintings
,
he
went
to
the
movies
.
In
the
summer
he
watched
baseball
on
television
;
in
the
winter
he
went
to
the
opera
.
More
than
anything
,
however
,
what
he
liked
to
do
was
walk
.
Nearly
every
day
,
rain
or
shine
,
hot
or
cold
,
he
would
leave
his
apartment
to
walk
through
the
city
–
never
really
going
anywhere
,
but
simply
going
wherever
his
legs
happened
to
take
him
.
New
York
was
an
inexhaustible
space
,
a
labyrinth
of
endless
steps
,
and
no
matter
how
far
he
walked
,
no
matter
how
well
he
came
to
know
its
neighborhoods
and
streets
,
it
always
left
him
with
the
feeling
of
being
lost
.
Lost
,
not
only
in
the
city
,
but
within
himself
as
well
.
Each
time
he
took
a
walk
,
he
felt
as
though
he
were
leaving
himself
behind
,
and
by
giving
himself
up
to
the
movement
of
the
streets
,
by
reducing
himself
to
a
seeing
eye
,
he
was
able
to
escape
the
obligation
to
think
,
and
this
,
more
than
anything
else
,
brought
him
a
measure
of
peace
,
a
salutatory
emptiness
within
.
The
world
was
outside
of
him
,
around
him
,
before
him
,
and
the
speed
with
which
it
kept
changing
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
dwell
on
any
one
thing
for
very
long
.
Motion
was
of
the
essence
,
the
act
of
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
and
allowing
himself
to
follow
the
drift
of
his
own
body
.
By
wandering
aimlessly
,
all
places
became
equal
,
and
it
no
longer
mattered
where
he
was
.
On
his
best
walks
,
he
was
able
to
feel
that
he
was
nowhere
.
New
York
was
the
nowhere
he
had
built
around
himself
,
and
he
realized
that
he
had
no
intention
of
ever
leaving
it
again
.
In
the
past
,
Quinn
had
been
more
ambitious
.
As
a
young
man
,
he
had
published
several
books
of
poetry
,
had
written
plays
,
critical
essays
,
and
had
worked
on
a
number
of
long
translations
.
But
quite
abruptly
,
he
had
given
up
all
that
.
A
part
of
him
had
died
,
he
told
his
friends
,
and
he
did
not
want
it
coming
back
to
haunt
him
.
It
was
then
that
he
had
taken
on
the
name
of
William
Wilson
.
Quinn
was
no
longer
that
part
of
him
that
could
write
books
,
and
although
in
many
ways
Quinn
continued
to
exist
,
he
no
longer
existed
for
anyone
but
himself
.
The
next
morning
,
Quinn
woke
up
earlier
than
he
had
in
several
weeks
.
As
he
drank
his
coffee
,
buttered
his
toast
,
and
read
through
the
baseball
scores
in
the
paper
(
the
Mets
had
lost
again
,
two
to
one
,
on
a
ninth
inning
error
)
,
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
was
going
to
show
up
for
his
appointment
.
Even
that
locution
,
'
his
appointment
'
,
seemed
odd
to
him
.
It
was
n't
his
appointment
,
it
was
Paul
Auster
's
.
And
who
that
person
was
he
had
no
idea
.
Nevertheless
,
as
time
wore
on
he
found
himself
doing
a
good
imitation
of
a
man
preparing
to
go
out
.
He
cleared
the
table
of
the
breakfast
dishes
,
tossed
the
newspaper
on
the
couch
,
went
into
the
bathroom
,
showered
,
shaved
,
went
on
to
the
bedroom
wrapped
in
two
towels
,
opened
the
closet
and
picked
out
his
clothes
for
the
day
.
He
found
himself
tending
toward
a
jacket
and
a
tie
.
Quinn
had
not
worn
a
tie
since
the
funerals
of
his
wife
and
son
,
and
he
could
not
even
remember
if
he
still
owned
one
.
But
there
it
was
,
hanging
amidst
the
debris
of
his
wardrobe
.
He
dismissed
a
white
shirt
as
too
formal
,
however
,
and
instead
chose
a
gray
and
red
check
affair
to
go
with
the
gray
tie
.
He
put
them
on
in
a
kind
of
trance
.
It
was
not
until
he
had
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
that
he
began
to
suspect
what
he
was
doing
.
I
seem
to
be
going
out
,
he
said
to
himself
.
But
if
I
am
going
out
,
where
exactly
am
I
going
?
An
hour
later
,
as
he
climbed
from
the
number
4
bus
at
70th
Street
and
Fifth
Avenue
,
he
still
had
not
answered
the
question
.
To
one
side
of
him
was
the
park
,
green
in
the
morning
sun
,
with
sharp
,
fleeting
shadows
;
to
the
other
side
was
the
Frick
,
white
and
austere
,
as
if
abandoned
to
the
dead
.
He
thought
for
a
moment
of
Vermeer
's
Soldier
and
Young
Girl
Smiling
,
trying
to
remember
the
expression
on
the
girl
's
face
,
the
exact
position
of
her
hands
around
the
cup
,
the
red
back
of
the
faceless
man
.
In
his
mind
,
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
map
on
the
wall
and
the
sunlight
pouring
through
the
window
,
so
like
the
sunlight
that
surrounded
him
now
.
He
was
walking
.
He
was
crossing
the
street
and
moving
eastward
.
At
Madison
Avenue
he
turned
right
and
went
south
for
a
block
,
then
turned
left
and
saw
where
he
was
.
I
seem
to
have
arrived
,
he
said
to
himself
.
He
stood
before
the
building
and
paused
.
It
suddenly
did
not
seem
to
matter
anymore
.
He
felt
remarkably
calm
,
as
if
everything
had
already
happened
to
him
.
As
he
opened
the
door
that
would
lead
him
into
the
lobby
,
he
gave
himself
one
last
word
of
advice
.
If
all
this
is
really
happening
,
he
said
,
then
I
must
keep
my
eyes
open
.
It
was
a
woman
who
opened
the
apartment
door
.
For
some
reason
,
Quinn
had
not
expected
this
,
and
it
threw
him
off
track
.
Already
,
things
were
happening
too
fast
.
Before
he
had
a
chance
to
absorb
the
woman
's
presence
,
to
describe
her
to
himself
and
form
his
impressions
,
she
was
talking
to
him
,
forcing
him
to
respond
.
Therefore
,
even
in
those
first
moments
,
he
had
lost
ground
,
was
starting
to
fall
behind
himself
.
Later
,
when
he
had
time
to
reflect
on
these
events
,
he
would
manage
to
piece
together
his
encounter
with
the
woman
.
But
that
was
the
work
of
memory
,
and
remembered
things
,
he
knew
,
had
a
tendency
to
subvert
the
things
remembered
.
As
a
consequence
,
he
could
never
be
sure
of
any
of
it
.
The
woman
was
thirty
,
perhaps
thirty-five
;
average
height
at
best
;
hips
a
touch
wide
,
or
else
voluptuous
,
depending
on
your
point
of
view
;
dark
hair
,
dark
eyes
,
and
a
look
in
those
eyes
that
was
at
once
self-contained
and
vaguely
seductive
.
She
wore
a
black
dress
and
very
red
lipstick
.
Mr
Auster
?
A
tentative
smile
;
a
questioning
tilt
to
the
head
.
That
's
right
,
said
Quinn
.
I
'm
Virginia
Stillman
,
the
woman
began
.
Peter
's
wife
.
He
's
been
waiting
for
you
since
eight
o'clock
.
The
appointment
was
for
ten
,
said
Quinn
,
glancing
at
his
watch
.
It
was
exactly
ten
.
He
's
been
frantic
,
the
woman
explained
.
I
've
never
seen
him
like
this
before
.
He
just
could
n't
wait
.
She
opened
the
door
for
Quinn
.
As
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
entered
the
apartment
,
he
could
feel
himself
going
blank
,
as
if
his
brain
had
suddenly
shut
off
.
He
had
wanted
to
take
in
the
details
of
what
he
was
seeing
,
but
the
task
was
somehow
beyond
him
at
that
moment
.
The
apartment
loomed
up
around
him
as
a
kind
of
blur
.
He
realized
that
it
was
large
,
perhaps
five
or
six
rooms
,
and
that
it
was
richly
furnished
,
with
numerous
art
objects
,
silver
ashtrays
,
and
elaborately
framed
paintings
on
the
walls
.
But
that
was
all
.
No
more
than
a
general
impression
–
even
though
he
was
there
,
looking
at
those
things
with
his
own
eyes
.
He
found
himself
sitting
on
a
sofa
,
alone
in
the
living
room
.
He
remembered
now
that
Mrs.
Stillman
had
told
him
to
wait
there
while
she
went
to
find
her
husband
.
He
could
n't
say
how
long
it
had
been
.
Surely
no
more
than
a
minute
or
two
.
But
from
the
way
the
light
was
coming
through
the
windows
,
it
seemed
to
be
almost
noon
.
It
did
not
occur
to
him
,
however
,
to
consult
his
watch
.
The
smell
of
Virginia
Stillman
's
perfume
hovered
around
him
,
and
he
began
to
imagine
what
she
looked
like
without
any
clothes
on
.
Then
he
thought
about
what
Max
Work
might
have
been
thinking
,
had
he
been
there
.
He
decided
to
light
a
cigarette
.
He
blew
the
smoke
into
the
room
.
It
pleased
him
to
watch
it
leave
his
mouth
in
gusts
,
disperse
,
and
take
on
new
definition
as
the
light
caught
it
.
He
heard
the
sound
of
someone
entering
the
room
behind
him
.
Quinn
stood
up
from
the
sofa
and
turned
around
,
expecting
to
see
Mrs.
Stillman
.
Instead
,
it
was
a
young
man
,
dressed
entirely
in
white
,
with
the
white-blond
hair
of
a
child
.
Uncannily
,
in
that
first
moment
,
Quinn
thought
of
his
own
dead
son
.
Then
,
just
as
suddenly
as
the
thought
had
appeared
,
it
vanished
.
Peter
Stillman
walked
into
the
room
and
sat
down
in
a
red
velvet
armchair
opposite
Quinn
.
He
said
not
a
word
as
he
made
his
way
to
his
seat
,
nor
did
he
acknowledge
Quinn
's
presence
.
The
act
of
moving
from
one
place
to
another
seemed
to
require
all
his
attention
,
as
though
not
to
think
of
what
he
was
doing
would
reduce
him
to
immobility
.
Quinn
had
never
seen
anyone
move
in
such
a
manner
,
and
he
realized
at
once
that
this
was
the
same
person
he
had
spoken
to
on
the
phone
.
The
body
acted
almost
exactly
as
the
voice
had
:
machine-like
,
fitful
,
alternating
between
slow
and
rapid
gestures
,
rigid
and
yet
expressive
,
as
if
the
operation
were
out
of
control
,
not
quite
corresponding
to
the
will
that
lay
behind
it
.
It
seemed
to
Quinn
that
Stillman
's
body
had
not
been
used
for
a
long
time
and
that
all
its
functions
had
been
relearned
,
so
that
motion
had
become
a
conscious
process
,
each
movement
broken
down
into
its
component
submovements
,
with
the
result
that
all
flow
and
spontaneity
had
been
lost
.
It
was
like
watching
a
marionette
trying
to
walk
without
strings
.
Everything
about
Peter
Stillman
was
white
.
White
shirt
,
open
at
the
neck
;
white
pants
,
white
shoes
,
white
socks
.
Against
the
pallor
of
his
skin
,
the
flaxen
thinness
of
his
hair
,
the
effect
was
almost
transparent
,
as
though
one
could
see
through
to
the
blue
veins
behind
the
skin
of
his
face
.
This
blue
was
almost
the
same
as
his
eyes
:
a
milky
blue
that
seemed
to
dissolve
into
a
mixture
of
sky
and
clouds
.
Quinn
could
not
imagine
himself
addressing
a
word
to
this
person
.
It
was
as
though
Stillman
's
presence
was
a
command
to
be
silent
.
Stillman
settled
slowly
into
his
chair
and
at
last
turned
his
attention
to
Quinn
.
As
their
eyes
met
,
Quinn
suddenly
felt
that
Stillman
had
become
invisible
.
He
could
see
him
sitting
in
the
chair
across
from
him
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
felt
as
though
he
was
not
there
.
It
occurred
to
Quinn
that
perhaps
Stillman
was
blind
.
But
no
,
that
did
not
seem
possible
.
The
man
was
looking
at
him
,
even
studying
him
,
and
if
recognition
did
not
flicker
across
his
face
,
it
still
held
something
more
than
a
blank
stare
.
Quinn
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
He
sat
there
dumbly
in
his
seat
,
looking
back
at
Stillman
.
A
long
time
passed
.
No
questions
,
please
,
the
young
man
said
at
last
.
Yes
.
No
.
Thank
you
.
He
paused
for
a
moment
.
I
am
Peter
Stillman
.
I
say
this
of
my
free
will
.
Yes
.
That
is
not
my
real
name
.
No
.
Of
course
,
my
mind
is
not
all
it
should
be
.
But
nothing
can
be
done
about
that
.
No
.
About
that
.
No
,
no
.
Not
anymore
.
You
sit
here
and
think
:
who
is
this
person
talking
to
me
?
What
are
these
words
coming
from
his
mouth
?
I
will
tell
you
.
Or
else
I
will
not
tell
you
.
At
the
corner
of
72nd
Street
and
Madison
Avenue
,
he
waved
down
a
cab
.
As
the
car
rattled
through
the
park
toward
the
West
Side
,
Quinn
looked
out
the
window
and
wondered
if
these
were
the
same
trees
that
Peter
Stillman
saw
when
he
walked
out
into
the
air
and
the
light
.
He
wondered
if
Peter
saw
the
same
things
as
he
did
,
or
whether
the
world
was
a
different
place
for
him
.
And
if
a
tree
was
not
a
tree
,
he
wondered
what
it
really
was
.
After
the
cab
had
dropped
him
off
in
front
of
his
house
,
Quinn
realized
that
he
was
hungry
.
He
had
not
eaten
since
breakfast
early
that
morning
.
It
was
strange
,
he
thought
,
how
quickly
time
had
passed
in
the
Stillman
apartment
.
If
his
calculations
were
correct
,
he
had
been
there
for
more
than
fourteen
hours
.
Within
himself
,
however
,
it
felt
as
though
his
stay
had
lasted
three
or
four
hours
at
most
.
He
shrugged
at
the
discrepancy
and
said
to
himself
,
I
must
learn
to
look
at
my
watch
more
often
.
He
retraced
his
path
along
107th
Street
,
turned
left
on
Broadway
,
and
began
walking
uptown
,
looking
for
a
suitable
place
to
eat
.
A
bar
did
not
appeal
to
him
tonight
–
eating
in
the
dark
,
the
press
of
boozy
chatter
–
although
normally
he
would
have
welcomed
it
.
As
he
crossed
112th
Street
,
he
saw
that
the
Heights
Luncheonette
was
still
open
and
decided
to
go
in
.
It
was
a
brightly
lit
yet
dreary
place
,
with
a
large
rack
of
girlie
magazines
on
one
wall
,
an
area
for
stationery
supplies
,
another
area
for
newspapers
,
several
tables
for
patrons
,
and
a
long
Formica
counter
with
swivel
stools
.
A
tall
Puerto
Rican
man
in
a
white
cardboard
chef
's
hat
stood
behind
the
counter
.
It
was
his
job
to
make
the
food
,
which
consisted
mainly
of
gristle-studded
hamburger
patties
,
bland
sandwiches
with
pale
tomatoes
and
wilted
lettuce
,
milkshakes
,
egg
creams
,
and
buns
.
To
his
right
,
ensconced
behind
the
cash
register
,
was
the
boss
,
a
small
balding
man
with
curly
hair
and
a
concentration
camp
number
tattoed
on
his
forearm
,
lording
it
over
his
domain
of
cigarettes
,
pipes
,
and
cigars
.
He
sat
there
impassively
,
reading
the
night-owl
edition
of
the
next
morning
's
Daily
News
.
The
place
was
almost
deserted
at
that
hour
.
He
would
arrive
early
,
never
later
than
seven
o'clock
and
sit
there
with
a
take-out
coffee
,
a
buttered
roll
,
and
an
open
newspaper
on
his
lap
,
watching
the
glass
door
of
the
hotel
.
By
eight
o'clock
Stillman
would
come
out
,
always
in
his
long
brown
overcoat
,
carrying
a
large
,
old-fashioned
carpet
bag
.
For
two
weeks
this
routine
did
not
vary
.
The
old
man
would
wander
through
the
streets
of
the
neighborhood
,
advancing
slowly
,
sometimes
by
the
merest
of
increments
,
pausing
,
moving
on
again
,
pausing
once
more
,
as
though
each
step
had
to
be
weighed
and
measured
before
it
could
take
its
place
among
the
sum
total
of
steps
.
Moving
in
this
manner
was
difficult
for
Quinn
.
He
was
used
to
walking
briskly
,
and
all
this
starting
and
stopping
and
shuffling
began
to
be
a
strain
,
as
though
the
rhythm
of
his
body
was
being
disrupted
.
He
was
hare
in
pursuit
of
the
tortoise
,
and
again
and
again
he
had
to
remind
himself
to
hold
back
.
What
Stillman
did
on
these
walks
remained
something
of
a
mystery
to
Quinn
.
He
could
,
of
course
,
see
with
his
own
eyes
what
happened
,
and
all
these
things
he
dutifully
recorded
in
his
red
notebook
.
But
the
meaning
of
these
things
continued
to
elude
him
.
Stillman
never
seemed
to
be
going
anywhere
in
particular
,
nor
did
he
seem
to
know
where
he
was
.
and
yet
,
as
if
by
conscious
design
,
he
kept
to
a
narrowly
circumscribed
area
,
bounded
on
the
north
by
Riverside
Park
,
and
on
the
east
by
Amsterdam
Avenue
.
No
matter
how
haphazard
his
journeys
seemed
to
be
–
and
each
day
his
itinerary
was
different
–
Stillman
never
crossed
these
borders
.
Such
precision
baffled
Quinn
,
for
in
all
other
respects
Stillman
seemed
to
be
aimless
.
As
he
walked
,
Stillman
did
not
look
up
.
His
eyes
were
permanently
fixed
on
the
pavement
,
as
though
he
were
searching
for
something
.
Indeed
,
every
now
and
then
he
would
stoop
down
,
pick
some
object
off
the
ground
,
and
examine
it
closely
,
turning
it
over
and
over
in
his
hand
.
It
made
Quinn
think
of
an
archeologist
inspecting
a
shard
at
some
prehistoric
ruin
.
Occasionally
,
after
poring
over
an
object
in
this
way
,
Stillman
would
toss
it
back
onto
the
sidewalk
.
But
more
often
than
not
he
would
open
his
bag
and
lay
the
object
gently
inside
it
.
Then
,
reaching
into
one
of
his
coat
pockets
,
he
would
remove
a
red
notebook
–
similar
to
Quinn
's
but
smaller
–
and
write
in
it
with
great
concentration
for
a
minute
or
two
.
Having
completed
this
operation
,
he
would
return
the
notebook
to
his
pocket
,
pick
up
his
bag
,
and
continue
on
his
way
.
As
far
as
Quinn
could
tell
,
the
objects
Stillman
collected
were
valueless
.
They
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
broken
things
,
discarded
things
,
stray
bits
of
junk
.
Over
the
days
that
passed
,
Quinn
noted
a
collapsible
umbrella
shorn
of
its
material
,
the
severed
head
of
a
rubber
doll
,
a
black
glove
,
the
bottom
of
a
shattered
light
bulb
,
several
pieces
of
printed
matter
(
sogged
magazines
,
shredded
newspapers
)
,
a
torn
photograph
,
anonymous
machinery
parts
,
and
sundry
other
clumps
of
flotsam
he
could
not
identify
.
The
fact
that
Stillman
took
this
scavenging
seriously
intrigued
Quinn
,
but
he
could
do
no
more
than
observe
,
write
down
what
he
saw
in
the
red
notebook
,
hover
stupidly
on
the
surface
of
things
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
pleased
him
to
know
that
Stillman
also
had
a
red
notebook
,
as
if
this
formed
a
secret
link
between
them
.
Quinn
suspected
that
Stillman
's
red
notebook
contained
answers
to
the
questions
that
had
been
accumulating
in
his
mind
,
and
he
began
to
plot
various
stratagems
for
stealing
it
from
the
old
man
.
But
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
such
a
step
.
Other
than
picking
up
objects
from
the
street
,
Stillman
seemed
to
do
nothing
.
Every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
somewhere
for
a
meal
.
Occasionally
he
would
bump
into
someone
and
mumble
an
apology
.
Once
a
car
nearly
ran
him
over
as
he
was
crossing
the
street
.
Stillman
did
not
talk
to
anyone
,
did
not
go
into
any
stores
,
did
not
smile
.
He
seemed
neither
happy
nor
sad
.
Twice
,
when
his
scavenging
haul
had
been
unusually
large
,
he
returned
to
the
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
remerged
a
few
minutes
later
with
an
empty
bag
.
On
most
days
he
spent
at
least
several
hours
in
Riverside
Park
,
walking
methodically
along
the
macadam
footpaths
or
else
thrashing
through
the
bushes
with
a
stick
.
His
quest
for
objects
did
not
abate
amidst
the
greenery
.
Stones
,
leaves
,
and
twigs
all
found
their
way
into
his
bag
.
Once
,
Quinn
observed
,
he
even
stooped
down
for
a
dried
dog
turd
,
sniffed
it
carefully
,
and
kept
it
.
It
was
in
the
park
,
too
,
that
Stillman
rested
.
In
the
afternoon
,
often
following
his
lunch
,
he
would
sit
on
a
bench
and
gaze
out
across
the
Hudson
.
Once
,
on
a
particularly
warm
day
,
Quinn
saw
him
sprawled
out
on
the
grass
asleep
.
When
darkness
came
,
Stillman
would
eat
dinner
at
the
Apollo
Coffee
Shop
on
97th
Street
and
Broadway
and
then
return
to
his
hotel
for
the
night
.
Not
once
did
he
try
to
contact
his
son
.
This
was
confirmed
by
Virginia
Stillman
,
whom
Quinn
called
each
night
after
returning
home
.
The
essential
thing
was
to
stay
involved
.
Little
by
little
,
Quinn
began
to
feel
cut
off
from
his
original
intentions
,
and
he
wondered
now
if
he
had
not
embarked
on
a
meaningless
project
.
It
was
possible
,
of
course
,
that
Stillman
was
merely
biding
his
time
,
lulling
the
world
into
lethargy
before
striking
.
But
that
would
assume
he
was
aware
of
being
watched
,
and
Quinn
felt
that
was
unlikely
.
He
had
done
his
job
well
so
far
,
keeping
at
a
discreet
distance
from
the
old
man
,
blending
into
the
traffic
of
the
street
,
neither
calling
attention
to
himself
nor
taking
drastic
measures
to
keep
himself
hidden
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
was
possible
that
Stillman
had
known
all
along
that
he
would
be
watched
–
had
even
known
it
in
advance
–
and
therefore
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
discover
who
the
particular
watcher
was
.
If
being
followed
was
a
certainty
,
what
did
it
matter
?
A
watcher
,
once
discovered
,
could
always
be
replaced
by
another
.
This
view
of
the
situation
comforted
Quinn
,
and
he
decided
to
believe
in
it
,
even
though
he
had
no
grounds
for
belief
.
Either
Stillman
knew
what
he
was
doing
or
he
did
n't
.
and
if
he
did
n't
,
then
Quinn
was
going
nowhere
,
was
wasting
his
time
.
How
much
better
it
was
to
believe
that
all
his
steps
were
actually
to
some
purpose
.
If
this
interpretation
required
knowledge
on
Stillman
's
part
,
then
Quinn
would
accept
this
knowledge
as
an
article
of
faith
,
at
least
for
the
time
being
.
There
remained
the
problem
of
how
to
occupy
his
thoughts
as
he
followed
the
old
man
.
Quinn
was
used
to
wandering
.
His
excursions
through
the
city
had
taught
him
to
understand
the
connectedness
of
inner
and
outer
.
Using
aimless
motion
as
a
technique
of
reversal
,
on
his
best
days
he
could
bring
the
outside
in
and
thus
usurp
the
sovereignty
of
inwardness
.
By
flooding
himself
with
externals
,
by
drowning
himself
out
of
himself
,
he
had
managed
to
exert
some
small
degree
of
control
over
his
fits
of
despair
.
Wandering
,
therefore
,
was
a
kind
of
mindlessness
.
But
following
Stillman
was
not
wandering
.
Stillman
could
wander
,
he
could
stagger
like
a
blindman
from
one
spot
to
another
,
but
this
was
a
privilege
denied
to
Quinn
.
For
he
was
obliged
now
to
concentrate
on
what
he
was
doing
,
even
if
it
was
next
to
nothing
.
Time
and
again
his
thoughts
would
begin
to
drift
,
and
soon
thereafter
his
steps
would
follow
suit
.
This
meant
that
he
was
constantly
in
danger
of
quickening
his
pace
and
crashing
into
Stillman
from
behind
.
To
guard
against
this
mishap
he
devised
several
different
methods
of
deceleration
.
The
first
was
to
tell
himself
that
he
was
no
longer
Daniel
Quinn
.
He
was
Paul
Auster
now
,
and
with
each
step
he
took
he
tried
to
fit
more
comfortably
into
the
strictures
of
that
transformation
.
Auster
was
no
more
than
a
name
to
him
,
a
husk
without
content
.
To
be
Auster
meant
being
a
man
with
no
interior
,
a
man
with
no
thoughts
.
Stillman
was
gone
now
.
The
old
man
had
become
part
of
the
city
.
He
was
a
speck
,
a
punctuation
mark
,
a
brick
in
an
endless
wall
of
bricks
.
Quinn
could
walk
through
the
streets
every
day
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
and
still
he
would
not
find
him
.
Everything
had
been
reduced
to
chance
,
a
nightmare
of
numbers
and
probabilities
.
There
were
no
clues
,
no
leads
,
no
moves
to
be
made
.
Quinn
backtracked
in
his
mind
to
the
beginning
of
the
case
.
His
job
had
been
to
protect
Peter
,
not
to
follow
Stillman
.
That
had
simply
been
a
method
,
a
way
of
trying
to
predict
what
would
happen
.
By
watching
Stillman
,
the
theory
was
that
he
would
learn
what
his
intentions
were
toward
Peter
.
He
had
followed
the
old
man
for
two
weeks
.
What
,
then
,
could
he
conclude
?
Not
much
.
Stillman
's
behavior
had
been
too
obscure
to
give
any
hints
.
There
were
,
of
course
,
certain
extreme
measures
that
they
could
take
.
He
could
suggest
to
Virginia
Stillman
that
she
get
an
unlisted
telephone
number
.
That
would
eliminate
the
disturbing
calls
,
at
least
temporarily
.
If
that
failed
,
she
and
Peter
could
move
.
They
could
leave
the
neighborhood
,
perhaps
leave
the
city
altogether
.
At
the
very
worst
,
they
could
take
on
new
identities
,
live
under
different
names
.
This
last
thought
reminded
him
of
something
important
.
Until
now
,
he
realized
,
he
had
never
seriously
questioned
the
circumstances
of
his
hiring
.
Things
had
happened
too
quickly
,
and
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
could
fill
in
for
Paul
Auster
.
Once
he
had
taken
the
leap
into
that
name
,
he
had
stopped
thinking
about
Auster
himself
.
If
this
man
was
as
good
a
detective
as
the
Stillmans
thought
he
was
,
perhaps
he
would
be
able
to
help
with
the
case
.
Quinn
would
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
Auster
would
forgive
him
,
and
together
they
would
work
to
save
Peter
Stillman
.
He
looked
through
the
yellow
pages
for
the
Auster
Detective
Agency
.
There
was
no
listing
.
In
the
white
pages
,
however
,
he
found
the
name
.
There
was
one
Paul
Auster
in
Manhattan
,
living
on
Riverside
Drive
–
not
far
from
Quinn
's
own
house
.
There
was
no
mention
of
a
detective
agency
,
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
anything
.
It
could
be
that
Auster
had
so
much
work
he
did
n't
need
to
advertise
.
Quinn
picked
up
the
phone
and
was
about
to
dial
when
he
thought
better
of
it
.
This
was
too
important
a
conversation
to
leave
to
the
phone
.
He
did
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
being
brushed
off
.
Since
Auster
did
not
have
an
office
,
that
meant
he
worked
at
home
.
Quinn
would
go
there
and
talk
to
him
face
to
face
.
The
rain
had
stopped
now
,
and
although
the
sky
was
still
gray
,
far
to
the
west
Quinn
could
see
a
tiny
shift
of
light
seeping
through
the
clouds
.
As
he
walked
up
Riverside
Drive
,
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
no
longer
following
Stillman
.
It
felt
as
though
he
had
lost
half
of
himself
.
For
two
weeks
he
had
been
tied
by
an
invisible
thread
to
the
old
man
.
Whatever
Stillman
had
done
,
he
had
done
;
wherever
Stillman
had
gone
,
he
had
gone
.
His
body
was
not
accustomed
to
this
new
freedom
,
and
for
the
first
few
blocks
he
walked
at
the
old
shuffling
pace
.
The
spell
was
over
,
and
yet
his
body
did
not
know
it
.
Auster
's
building
was
in
the
middle
of
the
long
block
that
ran
between
116th
and
119th
Streets
,
just
south
of
Riverside
Church
and
Grant
's
Tomb
.
It
was
a
well-kept
place
,
with
polished
doorknobs
and
clean
glass
,
and
it
had
an
air
of
bourgeois
sobriety
that
appealed
to
Quinn
at
that
moment
.
Auster
's
apartment
was
on
the
eleventh
floor
,
and
Quinn
rang
the
buzzer
,
expecting
to
hear
a
voice
speak
to
him
through
the
intercom
.
But
the
door
buzzer
answered
him
without
any
conversation
.
Quinn
pushed
the
door
open
,
walked
through
the
lobby
,
and
rode
the
elevator
to
the
eleventh
floor
.
It
was
a
man
who
opened
the
apartment
door
.
He
was
a
tall
dark
fellow
in
his
mid-thirties
,
with
rumpled
clothes
and
a
two-day
beard
.
In
his
right
hand
,
fixed
between
his
thumb
and
first
two
fingers
,
he
held
an
uncapped
fountain
pen
,
still
poised
in
a
writing
position
.
The
man
seemed
surprised
to
find
a
stranger
standing
before
him
.
Yes
?
he
asked
tentatively
.
Quinn
spoke
in
the
politest
tone
he
could
muster
.
Were
you
expecting
someone
else
?
My
wife
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
That
's
why
I
rang
the
buzzer
without
asking
who
it
was
.
I
'm
sorry
to
disturb
you
,
Quinn
apologized
.
But
I
'm
looking
for
Paul
Auster
.
I
'm
Paul
Auster
,
said
the
man
.
I
wonder
if
I
could
talk
to
you
.
It
's
quite
important
.
You
'll
have
to
tell
me
what
it
's
about
first
.
I
hardly
know
myself
.
Quinn
gave
Auster
an
honest
look
.
It
's
complicated
,
I
'm
afraid
.
Very
complicated
.
Do
you
have
a
name
?
I
'm
sorry
.
Of
course
I
do
.
Quinn
.
The
name
seemed
to
suggest
something
to
Auster
,
and
he
paused
for
a
moment
abstractedly
,
as
if
searching
through
his
memory
.
Quinn
,
he
muttered
to
himself
.
I
know
that
name
from
somewhere
.
He
went
silent
again
,
straining
harder
to
dredge
up
the
answer
.
You
are
n't
a
poet
,
are
you
?
I
used
to
be
,
said
Quinn
.
But
I
have
n't
written
poems
for
a
long
time
now
.
You
did
a
book
several
years
ago
,
did
n't
you
?
I
think
the
title
was
Unfinished
Business
.
A
little
book
with
a
blue
cover
.
Yes
.
That
was
me
.
I
liked
it
very
much
.
I
kept
hoping
to
see
more
of
your
work
.
In
fact
,
I
even
wondered
what
had
happened
to
you
.
I
'm
still
here
.
Sort
of
.
Auster
opened
the
door
wider
and
gestured
for
Quinn
to
enter
the
apartment
.
It
was
a
pleasant
enough
place
inside
;
oddly
shaped
,
with
several
long
corridors
,
books
cluttered
everywhere
,
pictures
on
the
walls
by
artists
Quinn
did
not
know
,
and
a
few
children
's
toys
scattered
on
the
floor
–
a
red
truck
,
a
brown
bear
,
a
green
space
monster
.
Auster
led
him
to
the
living
room
,
gave
him
a
frayed
upholstered
chair
to
sit
in
,
and
then
went
off
to
the
kitchen
to
fetch
some
beer
.
He
returned
with
two
bottles
,
placed
them
on
a
wooden
crate
that
served
as
the
coffee
table
,
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
across
from
Quinn
.
Was
it
some
kind
of
literary
thing
you
wanted
to
talk
about
?
Auster
began
.
No
,
said
Quinn
.
In
the
end
,
they
are
actually
successful
.
The
book
was
just
one
of
their
ploys
.
The
idea
was
to
hold
a
mirror
up
to
Don
Quixote
's
madness
to
record
each
of
his
absurd
and
ludicrous
delusions
,
so
that
when
he
finally
read
the
book
himself
,
he
would
see
the
error
of
his
ways
.
I
like
that
.
Yes
.
But
there
's
one
last
twist
.
Don
Quixote
,
in
my
view
,
was
not
really
mad
.
He
only
pretended
to
be
.
In
fact
,
he
orchestrated
the
whole
thing
himself
.
Remember
:
throughout
the
book
Don
Quixote
is
preoccupied
by
the
question
of
posterity
.
Again
and
again
he
wonders
how
accurately
his
chronicler
will
record
his
adventures
.
This
implies
knowledge
on
his
part
;
he
knows
beforehand
that
this
chronicler
exists
.
And
who
else
is
it
but
Sancho
Panza
,
the
faithful
squire
whom
Don
Quixote
has
chosen
for
exactly
this
purpose
?
In
the
same
way
,
he
chose
the
three
others
to
play
the
roles
he
destined
for
them
.
It
was
Don
Quixote
who
engineered
the
Benengali
quartet
.
And
not
only
did
he
select
the
authors
,
it
was
probably
he
who
translated
the
Arabic
manuscript
back
into
Spanish
.
We
should
n't
put
it
past
him
.
For
a
man
so
skilled
in
the
art
of
disguise
,
darkening
his
skin
and
donning
the
clothes
of
a
Moor
could
not
have
been
very
difficult
.
I
like
to
imagine
that
scene
in
the
marketplace
at
Toledo
.
Cervantes
hiring
Don
Quixote
to
decipher
the
story
of
Don
Quixote
himself
.
There
's
great
beauty
to
it
.
But
you
still
have
n't
explained
why
a
man
like
Don
Quixote
would
disrupt
his
tranquil
life
to
engage
in
such
an
elaborate
hoax
.
That
's
the
most
interesting
part
of
all
.
In
my
opinion
,
Don
Quixote
was
conducting
an
experiment
.
He
wanted
to
test
the
gullibility
of
his
fellow
men
.
Would
it
be
possible
,
he
wondered
,
to
stand
up
before
the
world
and
with
the
utmost
conviction
spew
out
lies
and
nonsense
?
To
say
that
windmills
were
knights
,
that
a
barber
's
basin
was
a
helmet
,
that
puppets
were
real
people
?
Would
it
be
possible
to
persuade
others
to
agree
with
what
he
said
,
even
though
they
did
not
believe
him
?
In
other
words
,
to
what
extent
would
people
tolerate
blasphemies
if
they
gave
them
amusement
?
The
answer
is
obvious
,
is
n't
it
?
To
any
extent
.
For
the
proof
is
that
we
still
read
the
book
.
It
remains
highly
amusing
to
us
.
And
that
's
finally
all
anyone
wants
out
of
a
book
–
to
be
amused
.
Auster
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
,
smiled
with
a
certain
ironic
pleaure
,
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
The
man
was
obviously
enjoying
himself
,
but
the
precise
nature
of
that
pleasure
eluded
Quinn
.
It
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
soundless
laughter
,
a
joke
that
stopped
short
of
its
punchline
,
a
generalized
mirth
that
had
no
object
.
Quinn
was
about
to
say
something
in
response
to
Auster
's
theory
,
but
he
was
not
given
the
chance
.
Just
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
,
he
was
interrupted
by
a
clattering
of
keys
at
the
front
door
,
the
sound
of
the
door
opening
and
then
slamming
shut
,
and
a
burst
of
voices
.
Auster
's
face
perked
up
at
the
sound
.
He
rose
from
his
seat
,
excused
himself
to
Quinn
,
and
walked
quickly
towards
the
door
.
Quinn
heard
laughter
in
the
hallway
,
first
from
a
woman
and
then
from
a
child
–
the
high
and
the
higher
,
a
staccato
of
ringing
shrapnel
–
and
then
the
basso
rumbling
of
Auster
's
guffaw
.
The
child
spoke
:
Daddy
,
look
what
I
found
!
And
then
the
woman
explained
that
it
had
been
lying
on
the
street
,
and
why
not
,
it
seemed
perfectly
okay
.
A
moment
later
he
heard
the
child
running
towards
him
down
the
hall
.
The
child
shot
into
the
living
room
,
caught
sight
of
Quinn
,
and
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
.
He
was
a
blond-haired
boy
of
five
or
six
.
Good
afternoon
,
said
Quinn
.
The
boy
,
rapidly
withdrawing
into
shyness
,
managed
no
more
than
a
faint
hello
.
In
his
left
hand
he
held
a
red
object
that
Quinn
could
not
identify
.
Quinn
asked
the
boy
what
it
was
.
It
's
a
yoyo
,
he
answered
,
opening
his
hand
to
show
him
.
I
found
it
on
the
street
.
Does
it
work
?
The
boy
gave
an
exaggerated
pantomine
shrug
.
Dunno
.
Siri
ca
n't
do
it
.
And
I
do
n't
know
how
.
Quinn
asked
him
if
he
could
try
,
and
the
boy
walked
over
and
put
it
in
his
hand
.
As
he
examined
the
yoyo
,
he
could
hear
the
child
breathing
beside
him
,
watching
his
every
move
.
The
yoyo
was
plastic
,
similar
to
the
ones
he
had
played
with
years
ago
,
but
more
elaborate
somehow
,
an
artifact
of
the
space
age
.
Quinn
fastened
the
loop
at
the
end
of
the
string
around
his
middle
finger
,
stood
up
,
and
gave
it
a
try
.
The
yoyo
gave
off
a
fluted
,
whistling
sound
as
it
descended
,
and
sparks
shot
off
inside
it
.
The
boy
gasped
,
but
then
the
yoyo
stopped
,
dangling
at
the
end
of
the
line
.
A
great
philosopher
once
said
,
muttered
Quinn
,
that
the
way
up
and
the
way
down
are
one
and
the
same
.
But
you
did
n't
make
it
go
up
,
said
the
boy
.
It
only
went
down
.
You
have
to
keep
trying
.
Quinn
was
rewinding
the
spool
for
another
attempt
when
Auster
and
his
wife
entered
the
room
.
He
looked
up
and
saw
the
woman
first
.
In
that
one
brief
moment
he
knew
that
he
was
in
trouble
.
She
was
a
tall
,
thin
blonde
,
radiantly
beautiful
,
with
an
energy
and
happiness
that
seemed
to
make
everything
around
her
invisible
.
It
was
too
much
for
Quinn
.
He
felt
as
though
Auster
were
taunting
him
with
the
things
he
had
lost
,
and
he
responded
with
envy
and
rage
,
a
lacerating
self-pity
.
Yes
,
he
too
would
have
liked
to
have
this
wife
and
this
child
,
to
sit
around
all
day
spouting
drivel
about
old
books
,
to
be
surrounded
by
yoyos
and
ham
omelettes
and
fountain
pens
.
He
prayed
to
himself
for
deliverance
.
Auster
saw
the
yoyo
in
his
hands
and
said
,
I
see
you
've
already
met
.
Daniel
,
he
said
to
the
boy
,
this
is
Daniel
.
And
then
to
Quinn
,
with
that
same
ironic
smile
,
Daniel
,
this
is
Daniel
.
The
boy
burst
out
laughing
and
said
,
Everybody
's
Daniel
!
That
's
right
,
said
Quinn
.
I
'm
you
,
and
you
're
me
.
And
around
and
around
it
goes
,
shouted
the
boy
,
suddenly
spreading
his
arms
and
spinning
around
the
room
like
a
gyroscope
.
And
this
,
said
Auster
,
turning
to
the
woman
,
is
my
wife
,
Siri
.
The
wife
smiled
her
smile
,
said
she
was
glad
to
meet
Quinn
as
though
she
meant
it
,
and
then
extended
her
hand
to
him
.
He
shook
it
,
feeling
the
uncanny
slenderness
of
her
bones
,
and
asked
if
her
name
was
Norwegian
.
Not
many
people
know
that
,
she
said
.
Do
you
come
from
Norway
?
Indirectly
,
she
said
.
By
way
of
Northfield
,
Minnesota
.
And
then
she
laughed
her
laugh
,
and
Quinn
felt
a
little
more
of
himself
collapse
.
Quinn
was
nowhere
now
.
He
had
nothing
,
he
knew
nothing
,
he
knew
that
he
knew
nothing
.
Not
only
had
he
been
sent
back
to
the
beginning
,
he
was
now
before
the
beginning
,
and
so
far
before
the
beginning
that
it
was
worse
than
any
end
he
could
imagine
.
His
watch
read
nearly
six
.
Quinn
walked
home
the
way
he
had
come
,
lengthening
his
strides
with
each
new
block
.
By
the
time
he
came
to
his
street
,
he
was
running
.
It
's
June
second
,
he
told
himself
.
Try
to
remember
that
.
This
is
New
York
,
and
tomorrow
will
be
June
third
.
If
all
goes
well
,
the
following
day
will
be
the
fourth
.
But
nothing
is
certain
.
The
hour
had
long
since
passed
for
his
call
to
Virginia
Stillman
,
and
he
debated
whether
to
go
through
with
it
.
Would
it
be
possible
to
ignore
her
?
Could
he
abandon
everything
now
,
just
like
that
?
Yes
,
he
said
to
himself
,
it
was
possible
.
He
could
forget
about
the
case
,
get
back
to
his
routine
,
write
another
book
.
He
could
take
a
trip
if
he
liked
,
even
leave
the
country
for
a
while
.
He
could
go
to
Paris
,
for
example
.
Yes
,
that
was
possible
.
But
anywhere
would
do
,
he
thought
,
anywhere
at
all
.
He
sat
down
in
his
living
room
and
looked
at
the
walls
.
They
had
once
been
white
,
he
remembered
,
but
now
they
had
turned
a
curious
shade
of
yellow
.
Perhaps
one
day
they
would
drift
further
into
dinginess
,
lasping
into
gray
,
or
even
brown
,
like
some
pieces
of
aging
fruit
.
A
white
wall
becomes
a
yellow
wall
becomes
a
gray
wall
,
he
said
to
himself
.
The
paint
becomes
exhausted
,
the
city
encroaches
with
its
soot
,
the
plaster
crumbles
within
.
Changes
,
then
more
changes
still
.
He
smoked
a
cigarette
,
and
then
another
,
and
then
another
.
He
looked
at
his
hands
,
saw
that
they
were
dirty
,
and
got
up
to
wash
them
.
In
the
bathroom
,
with
the
water
running
in
the
sink
,
he
decided
to
shave
as
well
.
He
lathered
his
face
,
took
out
a
clean
blade
,
and
started
scraping
off
his
beard
.
For
some
reason
,
he
found
it
unpleasant
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
kept
trying
to
avoid
himself
with
his
eyes
.
You
're
getting
old
,
he
said
to
himself
,
you
're
turning
into
an
old
fart
.
Then
he
went
into
the
kitchen
,
ate
a
bowl
of
cornflakes
,
and
smoked
another
cigarette
.
It
was
seven
o'clock
now
.
Once
again
,
he
debated
whether
to
call
Virginia
Stillman
.
As
he
turned
the
question
over
in
his
mind
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
no
longer
had
an
opinion
.
He
saw
the
argument
for
making
the
call
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
saw
the
argument
for
not
making
it
.
In
the
end
,
it
was
etiquette
that
decided
.
It
would
not
be
fair
to
disappear
without
telling
her
first
.
After
that
,
it
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
.
As
long
as
you
tell
people
what
you
are
going
to
do
,
he
reasoned
,
it
does
n't
matter
.
Then
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
.
The
number
,
however
,
was
busy
.
He
waited
five
minutes
and
dialed
again
.
Again
,
the
number
was
busy
.
For
the
next
hour
Quinn
alternated
between
dialing
and
waiting
,
always
with
the
same
result
.
At
last
he
called
the
operator
and
asked
whether
the
phone
was
out
of
order
.
There
would
be
a
charge
of
thirty
cents
,
he
was
told
.
Then
came
a
crackling
in
the
wires
,
the
sound
of
further
dialing
,
more
voices
.
Quinn
tried
to
imagine
what
the
operators
looked
like
.
Then
the
first
woman
spoke
again
:
the
number
was
busy
.
Quinn
did
not
know
what
to
think
.
There
were
so
many
possibilities
,
he
could
not
even
begin
.
Stillman
?
The
phone
off
the
hook
?
Someone
else
altogether
?
He
turned
on
the
television
and
watched
the
first
two
innings
of
the
Mets
game
.
Then
he
dialed
once
again
.
Same
thing
.
In
the
top
of
the
third
St.
Louis
scored
on
a
walk
,
a
stolen
base
,
an
infield
out
,
and
a
sacrifice
fly
.
The
Mets
matched
that
run
in
their
half
of
the
inning
on
a
double
by
Wilson
and
a
single
by
Youngblood
.
Quinn
realized
that
he
did
n't
care
.
A
beer
commercial
came
on
,
and
he
turned
off
the
sound
.
For
the
twentieth
time
the
same
thing
happened
.
In
the
top
of
the
fourth
St.
Louis
scored
five
runs
,
and
Quinn
turned
off
the
picture
as
well
.
He
found
his
red
notebook
,
sat
down
at
his
desk
,
and
wrote
steadily
for
the
next
two
hours
.
He
did
not
bother
to
read
over
what
he
had
written
.
Then
he
called
Virginia
Stillman
and
got
another
busy
signal
.
He
slammed
the
receiver
down
so
hard
that
the
plastic
cracked
.
When
he
tried
to
call
again
,
he
could
no
longer
get
a
dial
tone
.
He
stood
up
,
went
into
the
kitchen
,
and
made
another
bowl
of
cornflakes
.
Then
he
went
to
bed
.
In
his
dream
,
which
he
later
forgot
,
he
found
himself
walking
down
Broadway
,
holding
Auster
's
son
by
the
hand
.
Security
measures
are
strict
on
flights
to
Israel
,
the
bags
are
searched
,
the
men
are
frisked
,
and
the
women
have
an
electronic
hoop
passed
over
them
,
fore-and-aft
.
Then
hand
luggage
is
opened
.
No
one
is
very
patient
.
Visibility
in
the
queue
is
poor
because
of
the
many
Hasidim
with
their
broad
hats
and
beards
and
sidelocks
and
dangling
fringes
who
have
descended
on
Heathrow
and
are
far
too
restless
to
wait
in
line
but
rush
in
and
out
,
gesticulating
,
exclaiming
.
The
corridors
are
jumping
with
them
.
Some
two
hundred
Hasidim
are
flying
to
Israel
to
attend
the
circumcision
of
the
firstborn
son
of
their
spiritual
leader
,
the
Belzer
Rabbi
.
Entering
the
747
,
my
wife
,
Alexandra
,
and
I
are
enfiladed
by
eyes
that
lie
dark
in
hairy
ambush
.
To
me
there
is
nothing
foreign
in
these
hats
,
side-locks
,
and
fringes
.
It
is
my
childhood
revisited
.
At
the
age
of
six
,
I
myself
wore
a
tallith
katan
,
or
scapular
,
under
my
shirt
,
only
mine
was
a
scrap
of
green
calico
print
,
whereas
theirs
are
white
linen
.
God
instructed
Moses
to
speak
to
the
children
of
Israel
and
to
"
bid
them
that
they
make
them
fringes
in
the
borders
of
their
garments
.
"
So
they
are
still
wearing
them
some
four
thousand
years
later
.
We
find
our
seats
,
two
in
a
row
of
three
,
toward
the
rear
of
the
aircraft
.
Do
you
speak
Yiddish
?
he
says
.
Yes
,
certainly
.
Please
sit
between
us
.
Be
so
good
,
"
he
says
.
Of
course
.
I
take
the
middle
seat
,
which
I
dislike
,
but
I
am
not
really
put
out
.
Curious
,
rather
.
Our
Hasid
is
in
his
late
twenties
.
He
is
pimply
,
his
neck
is
thin
,
his
blue
eyes
goggle
,
his
underlip
extrudes
.
He
does
not
keep
a
civilized
face
.
Thoughts
and
impulses
other
than
civilized
fill
it
by
no
means
inferior
impulses
and
thoughts
.
And
though
he
is
not
permitted
to
sit
beside
women
unrelated
to
him
or
to
look
at
them
or
to
communicate
with
them
in
any
manner
(
all
of
which
probably
saves
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
)
,
he
seems
a
good-hearted
young
man
and
he
is
visibly
enjoying
himself
.
All
the
Hasidim
are
vividly
enjoying
themselves
,
dodging
through
the
aisles
,
visiting
chattering
standing
impatiently
in
the
long
lavatory
lines
,
amiable
,
busy
as
geese
.
They
pay
no
attention
to
signs
.
Do
n't
they
understand
English
?
The
stewardesses
are
furious
with
them
.
I
ask
one
of
the
hostesses
when
I
may
expect
to
receive
a
drink
and
she
cries
out
in
irritation
,
"
Back
to
your
seat
!
"
She
says
this
in
so
ringing
a
voice
that
I
retreat
.
Not
so
the
merry-minded
Hasidim
,
exulting
everywhere
.
The
orders
given
by
these
young
gentile
uniformed
females
are
nothing
to
them
.
To
them
they
are
merely
attendants
,
exotic
bediener
,
all
but
bodyless
.
Anticipating
a
difficulty
,
I
ask
the
stewardess
to
serve
me
a
kosher
lunch
.
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
we
have
n't
enough
for
them
,
she
says
.
We
were
n't
prepared
.
Her
big
British
eyes
are
affronted
and
her
bosom
has
risen
with
indignation
.
We
've
got
to
go
out
of
our
way
to
Rome
for
more
of
their
special
meals
.
Amused
,
my
wife
asks
why
I
ordered
the
kosher
lunch
.
Because
when
they
bring
my
chicken
dinner
this
kid
with
the
beard
will
be
in
a
state
,
I
explain
.
And
so
he
is
.
The
British
Airways
chicken
with
the
chill
of
death
upon
it
lies
before
me
.
But
after
three
hours
of
security
exercises
at
Heathrow
I
am
hungry
.
The
young
Hasid
recoils
when
the
tray
is
handed
to
me
.
He
addresses
me
again
in
Yiddish
.
He
says
,
"
I
must
talk
to
you
.
You
wo
n't
be
offended
?
"
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.
You
may
want
to
give
me
a
slap
in
the
face
.
Why
should
I
?
You
must
be
a
Jew
,
we
are
speaking
Yiddish
.
How
can
you
eat
that
!
"
It
looks
awful
,
does
n't
it
?
My
womenfolk
packed
kosher-beef
sandwiches
for
me
.
Is
your
wife
Jewish
?
"
Here
I
'm
obliged
to
lie
.
Alexandra
is
Rumanian
.
But
I
ca
n't
give
him
too
many
shocks
at
once
,
and
I
say
,
"
She
has
not
had
a
Jewish
upbringing
.
"
She
does
n't
speak
Yiddish
?
But
excuse
me
,
I
want
my
lunch
.
"
Will
you
eat
some
of
my
kosher
food
instead
,
as
a
favor
?
With
pleasure
.
You
must
never
never
eat
trephena
food
again
.
"
You
're
asking
too
much
.
And
just
for
one
sandwich
.
"
I
have
a
duty
toward
you
,
he
tells
me
.
Will
you
listen
to
a
proposition
?
Of
course
I
will
.
I
am
prepared
to
pay
you
.
If
you
will
eat
nothing
but
kosher
food
,
for
the
rest
of
your
life
I
will
send
you
fifteen
dollars
a
week
.
"
That
's
very
generous
,
I
say
.
Well
,
you
are
a
Jew
,
he
says
.
I
must
try
to
save
you
.
How
do
you
earn
your
living
?
We
are
all
Hasidim
there
.
The
boss
is
a
Hasid
.
I
came
from
Israel
five
years
ago
to
be
married
in
New
Jersey
.
My
rabbi
is
in
Jerusalem
.
"
How
is
it
that
you
do
n't
know
English
?
So
,
I
am
asking
,
will
you
take
my
fifteen
dollars
?
"
Kosher
food
is
far
more
expensive
than
other
kinds
,
I
say
.
Fifteen
dollars
is
n't
nearly
enough
.
I
can
go
as
far
as
twenty-five
.
I
ca
n't
accept
such
a
sacrifice
from
you
.
Shrugging
,
he
gives
up
and
I
turn
to
the
twice
disagreeable
chicken
and
eat
guiltily
,
my
appetite
spoiled
.
The
young
Hasid
opens
his
prayer
book
.
He
's
so
fervent
,
says
my
wife
.
I
wonder
if
he
's
praying
for
you
.
She
smiles
at
my
discomfiture
.
As
soon
as
the
trays
are
removed
,
the
Hasidim
block
the
aisles
with
their
Minchah
service
,
rocking
themselves
and
stretching
their
necks
upward
.
This
is
what
has
held
the
Jews
together
for
thousands
of
years
.
I
like
them
,
says
my
wife
.
They
're
so
lively
,
so
childlike
.
You
might
find
them
a
little
hard
to
live
with
,
I
tell
her
.
You
'd
have
to
do
everything
their
way
,
no
options
given
.
I
love
their
costumes
.
Could
n't
you
get
one
of
those
beautiful
hats
?
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
they
sell
them
to
outsiders
.
When
the
Hasid
returns
to
his
seat
after
prayers
,
I
tell
him
that
my
wife
,
a
woman
of
learning
,
will
be
lecturing
at
the
Hebrew
University
in
Jerusalem
.
What
is
she
?
A
mathematician
.
He
is
puzzled
.
What
is
that
?
he
asks
.
I
try
to
explain
.
He
says
,
"
This
I
never
heard
of
.
What
actually
is
it
they
do
?
"
I
am
astonished
.
I
knew
that
he
was
an
innocent
but
I
would
never
have
believed
him
to
be
ignorant
of
such
a
thing
.
Le
Monde
gloated
over
this
reversal
.
On
July
12
,
after
the
raid
,
Israel
was
accused
of
giving
comfort
to
the
reactionaries
of
Rhodesia
and
South
Africa
by
its
demonstration
of
military
superiority
and
its
use
of
Western
arms
and
techniques
,
upsetting
the
balance
between
poor
and
rich
countries
,
disturbing
the
work
of
men
of
good
will
in
Paris
who
were
trying
to
create
a
new
climate
and
to
treat
the
countries
of
the
Third
World
as
equals
and
partners
.
Rhodesians
and
South
Africans
,
said
Le
Monde
,
were
toasting
the
Israelis
in
champagne
.
But
European
approval
of
the
raid
would
endanger
the
plans
of
France
for
a
new
international
order
.
On
July
4-5
,
again
before
the
rescue
,
Le
Monde
had
reported
without
comment
wisecracks
made
by
Amin
in
a
speech
at
Port
Louis
.
Addressing
the
OAS
,
Amin
had
provoked
laughter
and
applause
among
the
delegates
by
saying
that
the
hostages
were
as
comfortable
as
they
could
be
in
the
circumstances
surrounded
by
explosives
.
When
I
left
,
he
said
,
laughing
,
"
the
hostages
wept
and
begged
me
to
stay
.
"
This
broke
everybody
up
.
We
step
into
the
street
and
my
friend
David
Shahar
,
whose
chest
is
large
,
takes
a
deep
breath
and
advises
me
to
do
the
same
.
The
air
,
the
very
air
,
is
thought-nourishing
in
Jerusalem
,
the
Sages
themselves
said
so
.
I
am
prepared
to
believe
it
.
I
know
that
it
must
have
special
properties
.
The
delicacy
of
the
light
also
affects
me
.
I
look
downward
toward
the
Dead
Sea
,
over
broken
rocks
and
small
houses
with
bulbous
roofs
.
The
color
of
these
is
that
of
the
ground
itself
,
and
on
this
strange
deadness
the
melting
air
presses
with
an
almost
human
weight
.
Something
intelligible
,
something
metaphysical
is
communicated
by
these
colors
.
The
universe
interprets
itself
before
your
eyes
in
the
openness
of
the
rockjumbled
valley
ending
in
dead
water
.
Elsewhere
you
die
and
disintegrate
.
Here
you
die
and
mingle
.
Shahar
leads
me
down
from
the
Mishkenot
Sha'ananim
,
which
stands
on
a
slope
and
faces
Mount
Zion
and
the
Old
City
,
to
the
Gai-Hinnom
(
Gehenna
of
tradition
)
,
where
worshipers
of
Moloch
once
sacrificed
their
children
.
He
leads
me
from
the
Gai-Hinnom
up
to
an
ancient
Karaite
burial
ground
,
where
you
can
see
the
mingling
for
yourself
.
It
acts
queerly
on
my
nerves
(
through
the
feet
,
as
it
were
)
,
because
I
feel
that
a
good
part
of
this
dust
must
be
ground
out
of
human
bone
.
I
do
n't
know
that
Jerusalem
is
geologically
older
than
other
places
but
the
dolomite
and
clay
look
hoarier
than
anything
I
ever
saw
.
Gray
and
sunken
,
in
the
thoughts
of
Mr
Bloom
in
Joyce
's
Ulysses
.
But
there
is
nothing
in
the
brilliant
air
and
the
massive
white
clouds
hanging
over
the
crumpled
mountains
that
suggests
exhaustion
.
This
atmosphere
makes
the
American
commonplace
"
out
of
this
world
"
true
enough
to
give
your
soul
a
start
.
The
municipality
has
turned
the
Gai-Hinnom
into
a
park
.
The
Wolfson
Foundation
of
London
has
paid
for
the
planting
of
gardens
,
and
Arab
kids
are
kicking
a
soccer
ball
in
the
green
bottom
of
the
valley
.
East
Jerusalem
toughies
of
fourteen
are
smoking
cigarettes
and
stiffening
their
shoulders
,
practicing
the
dangerous-loiterer
bit
as
we
pass
.
Shahar
is
bald
,
muscular
,
and
his
shirt
is
ornamented
with
nags
,
horseshoes
,
and
bridles
,
a
yellow
print
on
dark
blue
.
Amusing
,
since
he
's
a
writer
and
a
thoughtful
man
,
anything
but
a
tout
.
So
we
look
into
ancient
tombed
caverns
and
the
niches
into
which
corpses
once
were
laid
.
Now
truck
fenders
are
rusting
there
,
the
twentieth
century
adding
its
crumbling
metal
to
the
great
Jerusalem
dust
mixture
.
You
can
be
absolutely
sure
,
says
Shahar
,
that
the
Prophet
Jeremiah
passed
this
way
.
Right
where
we
are
standing
.
I
find
in
Elie
Kedourie
's
Arabic
Political
Memoirs
facts
unknown
to
most
about
American
diplomacy
in
the
late
forties
.
Certainly
I
did
n't
know
them
.
In
the
Middle
East
and
probably
elsewhere
,
the
United
States
relied
heavily
on
management
consultants
and
public-relations
experts
.
The
American
firm
of
Booz
,
Allen
&amp;
Hamilton
lent
one
of
its
specialists
,
Miles
Copeland
by
name
,
to
the
State
Department
,
where
he
was
in
1955
a
member
of
a
group
called
the
Middle
East
Policy
Planning
Committee
,
the
main
purpose
of
which
was
,
in
his
own
words
,
"
to
work
out
ways
of
taking
advantage
of
the
friendship
which
was
developing
between
ourselves
and
Nasser
.
"
In
1947
Copeland
had
been
sent
to
Damascus
(
"
by
whom
is
not
stated
,
"
Kedourie
says
)
"
to
make
unofficial
contact
"
with
Syrian
leaders
and
"
to
probe
for
means
of
persuading
them
,
on
their
own
,
to
liberalize
their
political
system
.
"
Spreading
democracy
over
the
world
,
the
Americans
first
fought
rigged
elections
in
Syria
,
but
the
old
corruption
continued
despite
all
their
power
and
money
could
do
.
Frustrated
,
the
Americans
decided
for
the
best
of
reasons
,
as
always
,
to
make
a
heavier
move
:
The
American
Minister
at
Damascus
decided
to
encourage
a
military
coup-d'etat
,
so
that
Syria
might
enjoy
democracy
,
Kedourie
writes
.
This
was
not
considered
particularly
bizarre
;
other
American
ambassadors
and
ministers
in
the
Arab
world
were
entirely
in
favor
of
"
genuine
"
revolution
to
overthrow
old
landowners
,
rich
crooks
,
and
politicians
.
Whoever
knows
the
Middle
East
will
agree
that
such
a
quest
was
the
political
equivalent
of
the
search
for
the
philosophical
stone
.
"
Failing
in
Syria
,
the
Americans
went
to
work
in
Egypt
.
Kermit
Roosevelt
of
the
CIA
"
met
a
number
of
officers
who
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
which
led
to
the
coup-d'etat
of
22
July
,
1952
.
"
The
Americans
wanted
the
new
regime
to
make
the
populace
literate
,
to
create
"
a
large
and
stable
middle
class
a
sufficient
identification
of
local
ideals
and
values
,
so
that
truly
indigenous
democratic
institutions
could
grow
up
.
"
Gliding
into
a
new
political
realm
,
the
Americans
arranged
for
loans
to
the
Egyptian
government
.
They
believed
that
genuine
democracy
was
now
on
its
way
.
James
Eichelberger
,
a
State
Department
political
scientist
who
had
been
an
account
executive
for
J
Walter
Thompson
,
one
of
the
world
's
largest
advertising
and
public-relations
firms
,
"
was
sent
to
Cairo
where
he
talked
with
Nasser
and
his
confidants
and
produced
a
series
of
papers
identifying
the
new
government
's
problems
and
recommending
policies
to
deal
with
them
.
"
One
of
these
papers
,
written
by
Eichelberger
himself
,
was
translated
into
Arabic
,
"
commented
upon
by
members
of
Nasser
's
staff
,
translated
back
into
English
for
Eichelberger
's
benefit
.
"
This
document
,
called
"
Power
Problems
of
a
Revolutionary
Government
,
"
went
back-and-forth
,
according
to
Mr
Copeland
,
"
between
English
and
Arabic
until
a
final
version
was
produced
.
The
final
paper
was
passed
off
to
the
outside
world
as
the
work
of
Zakaria
Mohieddin
,
Nasser
's
most
thoughtful
(
in
Western
eyes
)
,
reasonable
deputy
,
and
accepted
at
face
value
by
intelligence
analysts
of
the
State
Department
,
the
C.I.A.
and
,
presumably
,
similar
agencies
of
other
governments
.
"
Who
would
have
thought
that
a
former
American
account
executive
could
write
:
The
police
should
be
politisized
,
and
should
become
,
to
whatever
extent
necessary
,
a
partisan
paramilitary
arm
of
the
revolutionary
government
?
This
is
Leninism
,
neat
,
with
neither
ice
nor
bitters
.
Or
,
"
The
nerve
center
of
the
whole
security
system
of
a
revolutionary
state
(
or
of
any
state
)
lies
in
a
secret
body
,
the
identity
and
very
existence
of
which
can
be
safely
known
only
to
the
head
of
the
revolutionary
government
and
to
the
fewest
possible
number
of
other
key
leaders
.
"
It
was
Jefferson
who
said
that
the
tree
of
liberty
must
occasionally
be
refreshed
with
the
blood
of
patriots
and
tyrants
.
We
must
now
believe
that
the
same
romantic
conviction
has
been
alive
somewhere
in
the
offices
of
J
Walter
Thompson
.
The
United
States
is
,
after
all
,
the
prime
revolutionary
country
.
Or
was
Mr
Eichelberger
simply
an
executive
with
a
client
to
please
and
a
job
to
do
a
pure
professional
?
Or
is
there
in
the
world
by
now
a
natural
understanding
of
revolution
,
of
mass
organization
,
cadres
,
police
rule
,
and
secret
executive
bodies
?
This
is
a
shocking
suspicion
.
Of
course
the
paper
written
by
Mr
Eichelberger
and
his
Egyptian
collaborators
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
Nasser
seizure
of
power
was
"
to
solve
the
pressing
social
and
political
problems
which
made
the
revolution
necessary
.
"
To
solve
problems
,
to
help
,
to
befriend
,
to
increase
freedom
.
To
strengthen
America
's
position
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
do
good
;
to
advance
the
cause
of
universal
equality
;
to
be
the
illusionless
tough
guy
on
a
world
scale
;
to
be
a
mover
and
shaker
,
a
shaper
of
destiny
or
perhaps
,
surrendering
to
fantasies
of
omnipotence
,
to
be
the
nation-making
American
plenipotentiary
,
at
work
behind
the
scenes
and
playing
confidently
even
with
Bolshevik
fire
.
And
what
problems
were
solved
?
Nasser
solved
no
problems
.
Mr
Kedourie
doubts
that
he
needed
"
to
call
on
the
resources
of
American
political
science
for
such
lessons
in
tyranny
?
What
does
remain
most
puzzling
,
"
he
says
,
"
is
why
it
was
thought
that
the
imparting
of
such
lessons
could
advance
the
interests
of
the
United
States
,
or
even
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
the
Egyptian
people
.
"
For
an
American
,
the
most
intriguing
question
is
this
:
Whence
the
passion
for
social
theory
among
these
high
functionaries
of
the
advertising
world
?
How
did
executive
types
ever
learn
of
such
things
?
Reading
The
Sound
and
the
Fury
last
night
,
I
came
upon
words
in
Compson
's
thought
that
belonged
to
E
E
Cummings
and
the
thirties
,
not
to
the
year
1910
.
Land
of
the
kike
home
of
the
wop
,
says
Compson
to
himself
when
he
buys
a
bun
from
a
small
Italian
girl
.
This
I
would
have
read
without
flinching
in
Chicago
but
in
Jerusalem
I
flinched
and
put
the
book
down
.
Returning
to
it
next
day
,
I
found
Faulkner
guilty
of
no
offense
.
It
's
possible
that
people
at
the
turn
of
the
century
were
saying
"
land
of
the
kike
"
and
that
Faulkner
did
n't
borrow
it
from
Cummings
.
I
had
been
telling
Shahar
when
we
were
walking
in
the
Gai-Hinnom
that
I
had
n't
liked
it
when
David
Ben-Gurion
on
his
visits
to
the
United
States
would
call
upon
American
Jews
to
give
up
their
illusions
about
goyish
democracy
and
emigrate
full
speed
to
Israel
.
As
if
America
's
two-hundred-year
record
of
liberal
democracy
signified
nothing
.
If
Israel
were
governed
as
Egypt
is
,
or
Syria
,
would
I
have
come
here
at
all
?
But
then
,
to
its
more
severe
leftist
critics
,
some
of
them
Jews
,
Israel
is
not
the
"
democratic
exception
"
it
is
said
to
be
.
The
New
Left
sees
it
as
a
reactionary
small
country
.
Its
detractors
tell
you
how
it
abuses
its
Arab
population
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Jewish
immigrants
from
North
Africa
and
the
Orient
.
It
is
occasionally
denounced
by
some
Israelis
as
corrupt
,
"
Levantine
,
"
theocratic
.
Gossip
traces
the
worst
of
the
Israeli
financial
swindles
to
the
most
observant
of
Orthodox
Jews
.
I
am
often
told
that
the
old
Ashkenazi
leaders
were
unimaginative
,
that
the
new
Rabin
group
lacks
stature
,
that
Ben-Gurion
was
a
terrible
old
guy
but
a
true
leader
,
that
the
younger
generation
is
hostile
to
North
African
and
Asian
Jews
.
These
North
African
and
Oriental
immigrants
are
blamed
for
bringing
a
baksheesh
mentality
to
Israel
;
the
intellectuals
are
blamed
for
letting
the
quality
of
life
(
a
deplorable
phrase
)
deteriorate
.
And
what
happened
immediately
?
"
I
speak
of
this
to
Shahar
.
He
says
to
me
,
"
Where
there
is
no
paradox
there
is
no
life
.
"
In
Jakov
Lind
's
interesting
brief
book
on
Israel
,
Ben-Gurion
is
quoted
as
saying
,
"
The
Jews
know
hardly
anything
of
a
hell
that
might
await
them
.
Their
hell
is
a
personal
dissatisfaction
with
themselves
if
they
are
mediocre
.
"
Jews
do
,
it
is
well
known
,
make
inordinate
demands
upon
themselves
and
upon
one
another
.
Upon
the
world
,
too
.
I
occasionally
wonder
whether
that
is
why
the
world
is
so
uncomfortable
with
them
.
At
times
I
suspect
that
the
world
would
be
glad
to
see
the
last
of
its
Christianity
,
and
that
it
is
the
persistency
of
the
Jews
that
prevents
it
.
I
say
this
remembering
that
Jacques
Maritain
once
characterized
European
anti-Semitism
of
the
twentieth
century
as
an
attempt
to
get
rid
of
the
moral
burden
of
Christianity
.
And
what
is
it
that
has
led
the
Jews
to
place
themselves
,
after
the
greatest
disaster
of
their
history
,
in
a
danger
zone
?
Would
n't
it
be
the
most
horrible
of
ironies
if
the
Jews
had
collected
themselves
conveniently
in
one
country
for
a
second
Holocaust
?
This
is
a
thought
that
sometimes
crosses
Jewish
minds
.
It
is
accompanied
by
the
further
reflection
(
partly
proud
,
mostly
bitter
)
that
we
Jews
seem
to
have
a
genius
for
finding
the
heart
of
the
crisis
.
The
Valley
of
Jehosaphat
,
with
its
tombs
.
A
narrow
road
,
and
on
the
slopes
acres
and
acres
of
stone
.
Caves
,
graves
,
litter
,
fallen
rocks
,
and
in
tiny
schoolrooms
Arab
boys
singing
their
lessons
.
Even
in
November
the
place
is
uncomfortably
warm
.
The
Jordanians
built
a
road
over
Jewish
graves
.
The
municipality
of
Jerusalem
is
planning
to
build
a
new
road
and
will
tear
the
Jordanian
one
up
.
The
Herodian
relics
are
all
that
relics
should
be
columns
distorted
,
well
worked
over
by
time
,
Absalom
's
tomb
with
its
bulbous
roof
and
odd
funnel
tapering
out
of
it
.
The
armies
of
the
dead
in
all
directions
,
interminable
.
A
fine
thing
to
obsess
yourself
with
,
burial
and
lamentation
and
lying
about
under
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
waiting
for
the
Messiah
's
trumpet
to
sound
.
a
few
Arab
hens
are
scratching
up
dust
and
pecking
.
Not
a
breakfast
egg
comes
to
the
table
that
is
n't
death-speckled
.
Parties
of
American
girls
come
down
the
slope
in
their
dungarees
,
with
sweaters
tied
by
their
sleeves
about
the
waist
.
Above
,
to
the
left
,
a
Muslim
cemetery
.
Everything
reflects
the
significant
event
,
for
the
significant
event
is
beyond
question
historical
and
political
,
not
private
.
She
thinks
that
it
is
sly
of
me
to
deny
this
.
Not
to
submit
to
what
societies
and
governments
consider
to
be
important
.
Stendhal
's
heroes
,
when
they
are
in
prison
,
choose
to
think
above
love
.
E
E
Cummings
,
locked
up
by
the
French
government
,
finds
his
aesthetic
paradise
in
the
detention
camp
of
Ferte
Mace
.
The
bravest
of
modern
writers
are
the
Mandelstams
and
the
Sinyavskys
.
Before
he
died
of
cold
,
hunger
,
and
exhaustion
in
Siberia
,
Osip
Mandelstam
recited
his
poems
to
other
convicts
,
at
their
request
.
Andrei
Sinyavsky
,
in
his
prison
journal
,
concentrates
on
art
.
Perhaps
to
remain
a
poet
in
such
circumstances
is
also
to
reach
the
heart
of
politics
.
Then
human
feelings
,
human
experience
,
the
human
form
and
face
,
recover
their
proper
place
the
foreground
.
My
friend
John
Auerbach
comes
up
from
Caesarea
to
see
me
.
A
kibbutznik
seaman
,
he
has
just
returned
from
a
voyage
.
I
have
known
him
for
only
a
few
years
but
he
has
become
a
dear
friend
.
I
had
been
warned
that
as
I
grew
older
the
difficulty
of
forming
new
friendships
would
be
great
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
find
it
much
easier
now
at
sixty
to
draw
near
to
people
.
John
looks
too
much
the
writer
slight
in
person
,
delicate
to
be
a
chief
engineer
.
He
does
,
however
,
hold
an
engineer
's
ticket
and
can
do
complicated
emergency
repairs
in
mid-ocean
.
Boyish
,
bearded
(
the
beard
is
short
and
copper-brown
)
,
nervous
,
a
bit
high
,
thinner
than
when
I
saw
him
last
,
he
carries
a
cardboard
valise
containing
books
and
booze
and
pyjamas
and
a
house
present
.
He
is
delighted
to
be
here
,
and
he
is
suffering
the
one
activates
the
other
.
He
is
grieving
for
his
son
.
Adam
Auerbach
served
in
an
electronic-warfare
unit
and
was
returning
from
a
military
action
when
the
helicopter
in
which
he
was
flying
crashed
.
We
embrace
and
then
we
go
out
of
doors
with
a
bottle
to
have
a
drink
and
get
some
sun
.
Even
on
a
sunny
morning
the
stone
buildings
of
Jerusalem
chill
your
hands
and
feet
.
Stepping
out
,
I
feel
a
bit
numb
,
like
a
wasp
in
autumn
.
We
sit
on
a
stone
wall
over
the
garden
and
drink
aquavit
.
He
wants
to
talk
.
He
loves
books
passionately
,
he
wants
to
discuss
American
literature
,
to
hear
marvelous
things
from
me
.
But
I
can
see
that
the
big
current
of
his
suffering
has
begun
to
run
heavily
.
He
has
returned
from
a
voyage
,
he
is
out
in
the
sun
shining
from
the
hills
of
Moab
,
he
is
drinking
aquavit
with
a
dear
friend
,
looking
over
at
Mount
Zion
.
But
his
son
is
dead
.
At
sixteen
John
escaped
from
the
Warsaw
ghetto
,
leaving
behind
his
parents
and
his
sister
.
They
were
killed
.
Everyone
was
killed
.
John
somehow
obtained
Polish
seaman
's
papers
,
and
for
several
years
he
worked
in
the
engine
rooms
of
German
freighters
.
When
the
war
ended
he
came
to
Israel
via
Cyprus
,
joined
Kibbutz
Sdot
Yam
,
married
,
and
had
two
children
.
His
first
wife
died
of
cancer
about
ten
years
ago
and
he
has
married
again
.
He
says
,
"
I
ask
myself
in
what
ways
my
life
has
not
been
typical
.
For
a
Jew
from
Eastern
Europe
it
has
been
completely
typical
war
,
death
of
mother
,
death
of
father
,
death
of
sister
,
four
years
in
disguise
among
the
Germans
,
death
of
wife
,
death
of
son
.
Thirty
years
of
hard
work
,
planting
and
harvesting
in
the
kibbutz
.
Nothing
exceptional
.
"
John
sails
infrequently
now
.
He
does
n't
like
the
new
huge
tankers
.
Supermechanized
,
ultraefficient
,
they
give
the
crew
no
time
in
foreign
ports
.
The
cargo
on
the
voyage
from
which
he
has
just
returned
was
Dead
Sea
potash
.
They
were
to
bring
home
Italian
steel
.
North
of
Naples
they
had
bad
weather
and
engine
trouble
,
but
they
reached
their
harbor
and
anchored
near
two
Japanese
ships
.
On
the
pilot
's
advice
they
were
moved
farther
into
port
by
two
tugs
.
Within
five
hours
John
had
repaired
the
engines
,
but
the
port
officials
claimed
that
the
ship
was
incapacitated
and
demanded
that
the
captain
post
a
twenty-thousand-dollar
bond
against
expenses
that
might
be
run
up
by
his
"
crippled
ship
.
"
True
,
the
ship
had
had
to
be
moved
into
its
berth
by
the
tugs
but
it
had
been
crippled
only
briefly
.
Well
,
this
matter
was
in
dispute
.
The
ship
lay
unloaded
and
demurrage
fees
mounted
in
brief
,
a
holdup
by
local
racketeers
.
The
same
everywhere
,
now
.
Everybody
has
some
con
going
,
says
John
,
who
loves
American
slang
.
The
home
office
in
Haifa
was
trying
to
get
protection
from
the
insurance
company
.
There
were
long
days
in
port
with
nothing
to
do
.
The
town
was
covered
in
potash
dust
.
Waiters
and
bartenders
wiped
dishes
and
glasses
continually
.
Brushing
at
dust
was
the
commonest
gesture
in
town
.
A
community
of
about
twenty
thousand
people
had
traffic
jams
worthy
of
Rome
,
cars
as
a
matter
of
course
rushing
into
the
reserved
bus
lanes
,
screwing
everything
up
and
honking
madly
.
It
all
came
to
a
panting
standstill
morning
and
evening
without
fail
.
To
get
away
from
the
traffic
snarl
you
could
climb
a
nearby
mountain
and
come
down
to
a
deserted
beach
,
similar
to
the
beach
at
Sdot
Yam
.
John
and
his
dog
,
Mississippi
,
went
there
every
day
.
The
German
tourists
had
gone
home
,
the
bathing
cabins
were
nailed
shut
.
It
was
lovely
,
the
small
waves
coming
in
steadily
.
In
little
pangs
,
said
John
.
Part
of
the
American
Sixth
Fleet
was
anchored
nearby
.
The
aircraft
carrier
John
F
Kennedy
,
with
its
helicopters
,
reminded
John
of
the
death
of
his
son
.
On
shore
leave
they
wear
civilian
clothing
now
.
This
probably
makes
them
less
rowdy
.
One
of
the
boys
was
from
Oklahoma
,
near
Tulsa
.
He
had
heard
of
Israel
,
but
only
just
,
and
he
was
not
especially
interested
.
John
was
delighted
by
this
.
A
clean
young
soul
,
he
said
.
Such
ignorance
was
refreshing
.
The
young
sailor
knew
nothing
about
holocausts
or
tanks
in
the
desert
or
terrorist
bombs
.
Back
at
sea
,
John
had
to
stand
double
watches
in
the
engine
room
because
he
was
shorthanded
.
Off
duty
,
he
read
in
his
cabin
and
chatted
with
his
confidante
,
Mississippi
.
The
crew
said
he
was
drinking
himself
silly
in
his
quarters
.
When
the
ship
passed
Stromboli
at
night
,
there
was
a
streak
of
crimson
lava
flowing
from
the
volcano
and
the
sailors
would
n't
leave
the
television
set
to
look
at
this
natural
phenomenon
.
But
an
owl
from
the
island
,
disturbed
by
the
sparks
,
flew
out
to
the
ship
and
was
discovered
next
day
on
the
mast
.
One
of
the
young
sailors
carried
it
down
.
Then
an
engine
man
from
the
Balkans
said
,
"
In
our
village
we
nailed
owls
to
the
church
door
when
we
caught
them
.
"
They
shut
the
owl
in
the
paint
locker
while
they
debated
what
to
do
with
it
,
and
in
the
night
John
set
it
free
.
The
bird
scratched
his
arm
rather
badly
.
Go
back
to
Stromboli
,
you
dumb
bastard
,
he
said
.
So
it
flew
off
and
the
ship
continued
on
its
foul
way
.
It
's
the
water
pumped
into
the
tanks
for
ballast
and
then
pumped
out
again
that
pollutes
the
seas
,
says
John
.
Before
I
left
Chicago
,
the
art
critic
Harold
Rosenberg
said
to
me
,
"
Going
to
Jerusalem
?
And
wondering
whether
people
will
talk
freely
?
You
've
got
to
be
kidding
,
they
'll
talk
your
head
off
.
"
He
spoke
as
a
Jew
to
a
Jew
about
Jewish
powers
of
speech
.
In
flight
,
if
the
door
of
your
plane
comes
open
you
are
sucked
into
space
.
Here
in
Jerusalem
,
when
you
shut
your
apartment
door
behind
you
you
fall
into
a
gale
of
conversation
exposition
,
argument
,
harangue
,
analysis
,
theory
,
expostulation
,
threat
,
and
prophecy
.
From
diplomats
you
hear
cagey
explanations
;
from
responsible
persons
,
cautious
and
grudging
statements
rephrasing
and
amending
your
own
questions
;
from
parents
and
children
,
deadly
divisions
;
from
friends
who
let
themselves
go
,
passionate
speeches
,
raging
denunciation
of
Western
Europe
,
of
Russia
,
of
America
.
I
listen
carefully
,
closely
,
more
closely
than
I
've
ever
listened
in
my
life
,
utterly
attentive
,
but
I
often
feel
that
I
have
dropped
into
a
shoreless
sea
.
The
subject
of
all
this
talk
is
,
ultimately
,
survival
the
survival
of
the
decent
society
created
in
Israel
within
a
few
decades
.
At
first
this
is
hard
to
grasp
because
the
setting
is
so
civilized
.
You
are
in
a
city
like
many
another
well
,
not
quite
,
for
Jerusalem
is
the
only
ancient
city
I
've
ever
seen
whose
antiquities
are
not
on
display
as
relics
but
are
in
daily
use
.
Still
,
the
city
is
a
modern
city
with
modern
utilities
.
You
shop
in
supermarkets
,
you
say
good
morning
to
friends
on
the
telephone
,
you
hear
symphony
orchestras
on
the
radio
.
But
suddenly
the
music
stops
and
a
terrorist
bomb
is
reported
.
A
new
explosion
outside
a
coffee
shop
on
the
Jaffa
Road
:
six
young
people
killed
and
thirty-eight
more
wounded
.
Uneasy
,
you
go
out
to
your
civilized
dinner
.
Bombs
are
exploding
everywhere
.
Dynamite
has
just
been
thrown
in
London
;
the
difference
is
that
when
a
bomb
goes
off
in
a
West
End
restaurant
the
fundamental
right
of
England
to
exist
is
not
in
dispute
.
Yet
here
you
sit
at
dinner
with
charming
people
in
a
dining
room
like
any
other
.
You
know
that
your
hostess
has
lost
a
son
;
that
her
sister
lost
children
in
the
1973
war
;
That
in
this
Jerusalem
street
,
coolly
sweet
with
night
flowers
and
dark
green
under
the
lamps
,
many
other
families
have
lost
children
.
And
on
the
Jaffa
Road
,
because
of
another
bomb
,
six
adolescents
two
on
a
break
from
night
school
stopping
at
a
coffee
shop
to
eat
buns
,
have
just
died
.
But
in
the
domestic
ceremony
of
passed
dishes
and
filled
glasses
thoughts
of
a
destructive
enemy
are
hard
to
grasp
.
What
you
do
know
is
that
there
is
one
fact
of
Jewish
life
unchanged
by
the
creation
of
a
Jewish
state
:
you
can
not
take
your
right
to
live
for
granted
.
Others
can
;
you
can
not
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
everyone
else
is
living
pleasantly
and
well
under
a
decent
regime
.
No
,
it
means
only
that
the
Jews
,
because
they
are
Jews
,
have
never
been
able
to
take
the
right
to
live
as
a
natural
right
.
To
be
sure
,
many
Israelis
refuse
to
admit
that
this
historic
uneasiness
has
not
been
eliminated
.
They
seem
to
think
of
themselves
as
a
fixed
power
,
immovable
.
Their
point
has
been
made
.
The
Nellie
,
a
cruising
yawl
,
swung
to
her
anchor
without
a
flutter
of
the
sails
,
and
was
at
rest
.
The
flood
had
made
,
the
wind
was
nearly
calm
,
and
being
bound
down
the
river
,
the
only
thing
for
it
was
to
come
to
and
wait
for
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
The
sea-reach
of
the
Thames
stretched
before
us
like
the
beginning
of
an
interminable
waterway
.
In
the
offing
the
sea
and
the
sky
were
welded
together
without
a
joint
,
and
in
the
luminous
space
the
tanned
sails
of
the
barges
drifting
up
with
the
tide
seemed
to
stand
still
in
red
clusters
of
canvas
sharply
peaked
,
with
gleams
of
varnished
sprits
.
A
haze
rested
on
the
low
shores
that
ran
out
to
sea
in
vanishing
flatness
.
The
air
was
dark
above
Gravesend
,
and
farther
back
still
seemed
condensed
into
a
mournful
gloom
,
brooding
motionless
over
the
biggest
,
and
the
greatest
,
town
on
earth
.
The
Director
of
Companies
was
our
captain
and
our
host
.
We
four
affectionately
watched
his
back
as
he
stood
in
the
bows
looking
to
seaward
.
On
the
whole
river
there
was
nothing
that
looked
half
so
nautical
.
He
resembled
a
pilot
,
which
to
a
seaman
is
trustworthiness
personified
.
It
was
difficult
to
realize
his
work
was
not
out
there
in
the
luminous
estuary
,
but
behind
him
,
within
the
brooding
gloom
.
Between
us
there
was
,
as
I
have
already
said
somewhere
,
the
bond
of
the
sea
.
Besides
holding
our
hearts
together
through
long
periods
of
separation
,
it
had
the
effect
of
making
us
tolerant
of
each
other
's
yarns
–
and
even
convictions
.
The
Lawyer
–
the
best
of
old
fellows
–
had
,
because
of
his
many
years
and
many
virtues
,
the
only
cushion
on
deck
,
and
was
lying
on
the
only
rug
.
The
Accountant
had
brought
out
already
a
box
of
dominoes
,
and
was
toying
architecturally
with
the
bones
.
Marlow
sat
cross-legged
right
aft
,
leaning
against
the
mizzen-mast
.
He
had
sunken
cheeks
,
a
yellow
complexion
,
a
straight
back
,
an
ascetic
aspect
,
and
,
with
his
arms
dropped
,
the
palms
of
hands
outwards
,
resembled
an
idol
.
The
Director
,
satisfied
the
anchor
had
good
hold
,
made
his
way
aft
and
sat
down
amongst
us
.
We
exchanged
a
few
words
lazily
.
Afterwards
there
was
silence
on
board
the
yacht
.
For
some
reason
or
other
we
did
not
begin
that
game
of
dominoes
.
We
felt
meditative
,
and
fit
for
nothing
but
placid
staring
.
The
day
was
ending
in
a
serenity
of
still
and
exquisite
brilliance
.
The
water
shone
pacifically
;
the
sky
,
without
a
speck
,
was
a
benign
immensity
of
unstained
light
;
the
very
mist
on
the
Essex
marshes
was
like
a
gauzy
and
radiant
fabric
,
hung
from
the
wooded
rises
inland
,
and
draping
the
low
shores
in
diaphanous
folds
.
Only
the
gloom
to
the
west
,
brooding
over
the
upper
reaches
,
became
more
somber
every
minute
,
as
if
angered
by
the
approach
of
the
sun
.
And
at
last
,
in
its
curved
and
imperceptible
fall
,
the
sun
sank
low
,
and
from
glowing
white
changed
to
a
dull
red
without
rays
and
without
heat
,
as
if
about
to
go
out
suddenly
,
stricken
to
death
by
the
touch
of
that
gloom
brooding
over
a
crowd
of
men
.
Forthwith
a
change
came
over
the
waters
,
and
the
serenity
became
less
brilliant
but
more
profound
.
The
old
river
in
its
broad
reach
rested
unruffled
at
the
decline
of
day
,
after
ages
of
good
service
done
to
the
race
that
peopled
its
banks
,
spread
out
in
the
tranquil
dignity
of
a
waterway
leading
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
.
We
looked
at
the
venerable
stream
not
in
the
vivid
flush
of
a
short
day
that
comes
and
departs
for
ever
,
but
in
the
august
light
of
abiding
memories
.
And
indeed
nothing
is
easier
for
a
man
who
has
,
as
the
phrase
goes
,
followed
the
sea
with
reverence
and
affection
,
than
to
evoke
the
great
spirit
of
the
past
upon
the
lower
reaches
of
the
Thames
.
The
tidal
current
runs
to
and
fro
in
its
unceasing
service
,
crowded
with
memories
of
men
and
ships
it
had
borne
to
the
rest
of
home
or
to
the
battles
of
the
sea
.
It
had
known
and
served
all
the
men
of
whom
the
nation
is
proud
,
from
Sir
Francis
Drake
to
Sir
John
Franklin
,
knights
all
,
titled
and
untitled
–
the
great
knights-errant
of
the
sea
.
It
had
borne
all
the
ships
whose
names
are
like
jewels
flashing
in
the
night
of
time
,
from
the
Golden
Hind
returning
with
her
round
flanks
full
of
treasure
,
to
be
visited
by
the
Queen
's
Highness
and
thus
pass
out
of
the
gigantic
tale
,
to
the
Erebus
and
Terror
,
bound
on
other
conquests
–
and
that
never
returned
.
It
had
known
the
ships
and
the
men
.
They
had
sailed
from
Deptford
,
from
Greenwich
,
from
Erith
–
the
adventurers
and
the
settlers
;
kings
'
ships
and
the
ships
of
men
on
Change
;
captains
,
admirals
,
the
dark
"
interlopers
"
of
the
Eastern
trade
,
and
the
commissioned
"
generals
"
of
East
India
fleets
.
Hunters
for
gold
or
pursuers
of
fame
,
they
all
had
gone
out
on
that
stream
,
bearing
the
sword
,
and
often
the
torch
,
messengers
of
the
might
within
the
land
,
bearers
of
a
spark
from
the
sacred
fire
.
What
greatness
had
not
floated
on
the
ebb
of
that
river
into
the
mystery
of
an
unknown
earth
!
...
The
dreams
of
men
,
the
seed
of
commonwealths
,
the
germs
of
empires
.
The
sun
set
;
the
dusk
fell
on
the
stream
,
and
lights
began
to
appear
along
the
shore
.
The
Chapman
lighthouse
,
a
three-legged
thing
erect
on
a
mud-flat
,
shone
strongly
.
Lights
of
ships
moved
in
the
fairway
–
a
great
stir
of
lights
going
up
and
going
down
.
And
farther
west
on
the
upper
reaches
the
place
of
the
monstrous
town
was
still
marked
ominously
on
the
sky
,
a
brooding
gloom
in
sunshine
,
a
lurid
glare
under
the
stars
.
And
this
also
,
said
Marlow
suddenly
,
has
been
one
of
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
.
He
was
the
only
man
of
us
who
still
followed
the
sea
.
The
worst
that
could
be
said
of
him
was
that
he
did
not
represent
his
class
.
He
was
a
seaman
,
but
he
was
a
wanderer
,
too
,
while
most
seamen
lead
,
if
one
may
so
express
it
,
a
sedentary
life
.
Their
minds
are
of
the
stay-at-home
order
,
and
their
home
is
always
with
them
–
the
ship
;
and
so
is
their
country
–
the
sea
.
One
ship
is
very
much
like
another
,
and
the
sea
is
always
the
same
.
In
the
immutability
of
their
surroundings
the
foreign
shores
,
the
foreign
faces
,
the
changing
immensity
of
life
,
glide
past
,
veiled
not
by
a
sense
of
mystery
but
by
a
slightly
disdainful
ignorance
;
for
there
is
nothing
mysterious
to
a
seaman
unless
it
be
the
sea
itself
,
which
is
the
mistress
of
his
existence
and
as
inscrutable
as
Destiny
.
For
the
rest
,
after
his
hours
of
work
,
a
casual
stroll
or
a
casual
spree
on
shore
suffices
to
unfold
for
him
the
secret
of
a
whole
continent
,
and
generally
he
finds
the
secret
not
worth
knowing
.
The
yarns
of
seamen
have
a
direct
simplicity
,
the
whole
meaning
of
which
lies
within
the
shell
of
a
cracked
nut
.
But
Marlow
was
not
typical
(
if
his
propensity
to
spin
yarns
be
excepted
)
,
and
to
him
the
meaning
of
an
episode
was
not
inside
like
a
kernel
but
outside
,
enveloping
the
tale
which
brought
it
out
only
as
a
glow
brings
out
a
haze
,
in
the
likeness
of
one
of
these
misty
halos
that
sometimes
are
made
visible
by
the
spectral
illumination
of
moonshine
.
His
remark
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
.
It
was
just
like
Marlow
.
It
was
accepted
in
silence
.
No
one
took
the
trouble
to
grunt
even
;
and
presently
he
said
,
very
slow
–
I
was
thinking
of
very
old
times
,
when
the
Romans
first
came
here
,
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
–
the
other
day
...
.
Light
came
out
of
this
river
since
–
you
say
Knights
?
Yes
;
but
it
is
like
a
running
blaze
on
a
plain
,
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
clouds
.
We
live
in
the
flicker
–
may
it
last
as
long
as
the
old
earth
keeps
rolling
!
But
darkness
was
here
yesterday
.
Imagine
the
feelings
of
a
commander
of
a
fine
–
what
'd
'ye
call
'em
?
–
trireme
in
the
Mediterranean
,
ordered
suddenly
to
the
north
;
run
overland
across
the
Gauls
in
a
hurry
;
put
in
charge
of
one
of
these
craft
the
legionaries
,
–
a
wonderful
lot
of
handy
men
they
must
have
been
too
–
used
to
build
,
apparently
by
the
hundred
,
in
a
month
or
two
,
if
we
may
believe
what
we
read
.
Imagine
him
here
–
the
very
end
of
the
world
,
a
sea
the
color
of
lead
,
a
sky
the
color
of
smoke
,
a
kind
of
ship
about
as
rigid
as
a
concertina
–
and
going
up
this
river
with
stores
,
or
orders
,
or
what
you
like
.
Sandbanks
,
marshes
,
forests
,
savages
,
–
precious
little
to
eat
fit
for
a
civilized
man
,
nothing
but
Thames
water
to
drink
.
No
Falernian
wine
here
,
no
going
ashore
.
Here
and
there
a
military
camp
lost
in
a
wilderness
,
like
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
–
cold
,
fog
,
tempests
,
disease
,
exile
,
and
death
,
–
death
skulking
in
the
air
,
in
the
water
,
in
the
bush
.
They
must
have
been
dying
like
flies
here
.
Oh
yes
–
he
did
it
.
Did
it
very
well
,
too
,
no
doubt
,
and
without
thinking
much
about
it
either
,
except
afterwards
to
brag
of
what
he
had
gone
through
in
his
time
,
perhaps
.
They
were
men
enough
to
face
the
darkness
.
And
perhaps
he
was
cheered
by
keeping
his
eye
on
a
chance
of
promotion
to
the
fleet
at
Ravenna
by-and-by
,
if
he
had
good
friends
in
Rome
and
survived
the
awful
climate
.
Or
think
of
a
decent
young
citizen
in
a
toga
–
perhaps
too
much
dice
,
you
know
–
coming
out
here
in
the
train
of
some
prefect
,
or
tax-gatherer
,
or
trader
even
,
to
mend
his
fortunes
.
Land
in
a
swamp
,
march
through
the
woods
,
and
in
some
inland
post
feel
the
savagery
,
the
utter
savagery
,
had
closed
round
him
,
–
all
that
mysterious
life
of
the
wilderness
that
stirs
in
the
forest
,
in
the
jungles
,
in
the
hearts
of
wild
men
.
There
's
no
initiation
either
into
such
mysteries
.
He
has
to
live
in
the
midst
of
the
incomprehensible
,
which
is
also
detestable
.
And
it
has
a
fascination
,
too
,
that
goes
to
work
upon
him
.
The
fascination
of
the
abomination
–
you
know
.
Imagine
the
growing
regrets
,
the
longing
to
escape
,
the
powerless
disgust
,
the
surrender
,
the
hate
.
He
paused
.
Mind
,
he
began
again
,
lifting
one
arm
from
the
elbow
,
the
palm
of
the
hand
outwards
,
so
that
,
with
his
legs
folded
before
him
,
he
had
the
pose
of
a
Buddha
preaching
in
European
clothes
and
without
a
lotus-flower
–
Mind
,
none
of
us
would
feel
exactly
like
this
.
What
saves
us
is
efficiency
–
the
devotion
to
efficiency
.
But
these
chaps
were
not
much
account
,
really
.
They
were
no
colonists
;
their
administration
was
merely
a
squeeze
,
and
nothing
more
,
I
suspect
.
They
were
conquerors
,
and
for
that
you
want
only
brute
force
–
nothing
to
boast
of
,
when
you
have
it
,
since
your
strength
is
just
an
accident
arising
from
the
weakness
of
others
.
They
grabbed
what
they
could
get
for
the
sake
of
what
was
to
be
got
.
It
was
just
robbery
with
violence
,
aggravated
murder
on
a
great
scale
,
and
men
going
at
it
blind
–
as
is
very
proper
for
those
who
tackle
a
darkness
.
The
conquest
of
the
earth
,
which
mostly
means
the
taking
it
away
from
those
who
have
a
different
complexion
or
slightly
flatter
noses
than
ourselves
,
is
not
a
pretty
thing
when
you
look
into
it
too
much
.
What
redeems
it
is
the
idea
only
.
An
idea
at
the
back
of
it
;
not
a
sentimental
pretense
but
an
idea
;
and
an
unselfish
belief
in
the
idea
–
something
you
can
set
up
,
and
bow
down
before
,
and
offer
a
sacrifice
to
...
.
He
broke
off
.
Flames
glided
in
the
river
,
small
green
flames
,
red
flames
,
white
flames
,
pursuing
,
overtaking
,
joining
,
crossing
each
other
–
then
separating
slowly
or
hastily
.
The
traffic
of
the
great
city
went
on
in
the
deepening
night
upon
the
sleepless
river
.
We
looked
on
,
waiting
patiently
–
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
till
the
end
of
the
flood
;
but
it
was
only
after
a
long
silence
,
when
he
said
,
in
a
hesitating
voice
,
I
suppose
you
fellows
remember
I
did
once
turn
fresh-water
sailor
for
a
bit
,
that
we
knew
we
were
fated
,
before
the
ebb
began
to
run
,
to
hear
about
one
of
Marlow
's
inconclusive
experiences
.
I
do
n't
want
to
bother
you
much
with
what
happened
to
me
personally
he
began
,
showing
in
this
remark
the
weakness
of
many
tellers
of
tales
who
seem
so
often
unaware
of
what
their
audience
would
best
like
to
hear
;
yet
to
understand
the
effect
of
it
on
me
you
ought
to
know
how
I
got
out
there
,
what
I
saw
,
how
I
went
up
that
river
to
the
place
where
I
first
met
the
poor
chap
.
It
was
the
farthest
point
of
navigation
and
the
culminating
point
of
my
experience
.
It
seemed
somehow
to
throw
a
kind
of
light
on
everything
about
me
–
and
into
my
thoughts
.
It
was
somber
enough
too
–
and
pitiful
–
not
extraordinary
in
any
way
–
not
very
clear
either
.
No
,
not
very
clear
.
And
yet
it
seemed
to
throw
a
kind
of
light
.
I
had
then
,
as
you
remember
,
just
returned
to
London
after
a
lot
of
Indian
Ocean
,
Pacific
,
China
Seas
–
a
regular
dose
of
the
East
–
six
years
or
so
,
and
I
was
loafing
about
,
hindering
you
fellows
in
your
work
and
invading
your
homes
,
just
as
though
I
had
got
a
heavenly
mission
to
civilize
you
.
It
was
very
fine
for
a
time
,
but
after
a
bit
I
did
get
tired
of
resting
.
Then
I
began
to
look
for
a
ship
–
I
should
think
the
hardest
work
on
earth
.
But
the
ships
would
n't
even
look
at
me
.
And
I
got
tired
of
that
game
too
.
Now
when
I
was
a
little
chap
I
had
a
passion
for
maps
.
I
would
look
for
hours
at
South
America
,
or
Africa
,
or
Australia
,
and
lose
myself
in
all
the
glories
of
exploration
.
At
that
time
there
were
many
blank
spaces
on
the
earth
,
and
when
I
saw
one
that
looked
particularly
inviting
on
a
map
(
but
they
all
look
that
)
I
would
put
my
finger
on
it
and
say
,
'
When
I
grow
up
I
will
go
there
.
'
The
North
Pole
was
one
of
these
places
,
I
remember
.
Well
,
I
have
n't
been
there
yet
,
and
shall
not
try
now
.
The
glamour
's
off
.
Other
places
were
scattered
about
the
Equator
,
and
in
every
sort
of
latitude
all
over
the
two
hemispheres
.
I
have
been
in
some
of
them
,
and
...
well
,
we
wo
n't
talk
about
that
.
But
there
was
one
yet
–
the
biggest
,
the
most
blank
,
so
to
speak
–
that
I
had
a
hankering
after
.
True
,
by
this
time
it
was
not
a
blank
space
any
more
.
It
had
got
filled
since
my
boyhood
with
rivers
and
lakes
and
names
.
It
had
ceased
to
be
a
blank
space
of
delightful
mystery
–
a
white
patch
for
a
boy
to
dream
gloriously
over
.
It
had
become
a
place
of
darkness
.
But
there
was
in
it
one
river
especially
,
a
mighty
big
river
,
that
you
could
see
on
the
map
,
resembling
an
immense
snake
uncoiled
,
with
its
head
in
the
sea
,
its
body
at
rest
curving
afar
over
a
vast
country
,
and
its
tail
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
land
.
And
as
I
looked
at
the
map
of
it
in
a
shop-window
,
it
fascinated
me
as
a
snake
would
a
bird
–
a
silly
little
bird
.
Then
I
remembered
there
was
a
big
concern
,
a
Company
for
trade
on
that
river
.
Dash
it
all
!
I
thought
to
myself
,
they
ca
n't
trade
without
using
some
kind
of
craft
on
that
lot
of
fresh
water
–
steamboats
!
Why
should
n't
I
try
to
get
charge
of
one
?
I
went
on
along
Fleet
Street
,
but
could
not
shake
off
the
idea
.
The
snake
had
charmed
me
.
You
understand
it
was
a
Continental
concern
,
that
Trading
society
;
but
I
have
a
lot
of
relations
living
on
the
Continent
,
because
it
's
cheap
and
not
so
nasty
as
it
looks
,
they
say
.
I
ventured
to
hint
that
the
Company
was
run
for
profit
.
You
forget
,
dear
Charlie
,
that
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
,
she
said
,
brightly
.
It
's
queer
how
out
of
touch
with
truth
women
are
.
They
live
in
a
world
of
their
own
,
and
there
had
never
been
anything
like
it
,
and
never
can
be
.
It
is
too
beautiful
altogether
,
and
if
they
were
to
set
it
up
it
would
go
to
pieces
before
the
first
sunset
.
Some
confounded
fact
we
men
have
been
living
contentedly
with
ever
since
the
day
of
creation
would
start
up
and
knock
the
whole
thing
over
.
After
this
I
got
embraced
,
told
to
wear
flannel
,
be
sure
to
write
often
,
and
so
on
–
and
I
left
.
In
the
street
–
I
do
n't
know
why
–
a
queer
feeling
came
to
me
that
I
was
an
impostor
.
Odd
thing
that
I
,
who
used
to
clear
out
for
any
part
of
the
world
at
twenty-four
hours
'
notice
,
with
less
thought
than
most
men
give
to
the
crossing
of
a
street
,
had
a
moment
–
I
wo
n't
say
of
hesitation
,
but
of
startled
pause
,
before
this
commonplace
affair
.
The
best
way
I
can
explain
it
to
you
is
by
saying
that
,
for
a
second
or
two
,
I
felt
as
though
,
instead
of
going
to
the
center
of
a
continent
,
I
were
about
to
set
off
for
the
center
of
the
earth
.
I
left
in
a
French
steamer
,
and
she
called
in
every
blamed
port
they
have
out
there
,
for
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
the
sole
purpose
of
landing
soldiers
and
custom-house
officers
.
I
watched
the
coast
.
Watching
a
coast
as
it
slips
by
the
ship
is
like
thinking
about
an
enigma
.
There
it
is
before
you
–
smiling
,
frowning
,
inviting
,
grand
,
mean
,
insipid
,
or
savage
,
and
always
mute
with
an
air
of
whispering
,
'
Come
and
find
out
.
'
This
one
was
almost
featureless
,
as
if
still
in
the
making
,
with
an
aspect
of
monotonous
grimness
.
The
edge
of
a
colossal
jungle
,
so
dark-green
as
to
be
almost
black
,
fringed
with
white
surf
,
ran
straight
,
like
a
ruled
line
,
far
,
far
away
along
a
blue
sea
whose
glitter
was
blurred
by
a
creeping
mist
.
The
sun
was
fierce
,
the
land
seemed
to
glisten
and
drip
with
steam
.
Here
and
there
grayish-whitish
specks
showed
up
,
clustered
inside
the
white
surf
,
with
a
flag
flying
above
them
perhaps
.
Settlements
some
centuries
old
,
and
still
no
bigger
than
pin-heads
on
the
untouched
expanse
of
their
background
.
We
pounded
along
,
stopped
,
landed
soldiers
;
went
on
,
landed
custom-house
clerks
to
levy
toll
in
what
looked
like
a
God-forsaken
wilderness
,
with
a
tin
shed
and
a
flag-pole
lost
in
it
;
landed
more
soldiers
–
to
take
care
of
the
custom-house
clerks
,
presumably
.
Some
,
I
heard
,
got
drowned
in
the
surf
;
but
whether
they
did
or
not
,
nobody
seemed
particularly
to
care
.
They
were
just
flung
out
there
,
and
on
we
went
.
Every
day
the
coast
looked
the
same
,
as
though
we
had
not
moved
;
but
we
passed
various
places
–
trading
places
–
with
names
like
Gran'
Bassam
Little
Popo
,
names
that
seemed
to
belong
to
some
sordid
farce
acted
in
front
of
a
sinister
backcloth
.
The
idleness
of
a
passenger
,
my
isolation
amongst
all
these
men
with
whom
I
had
no
point
of
contact
,
the
oily
and
languid
sea
,
the
uniform
somberness
of
the
coast
,
seemed
to
keep
me
away
from
the
truth
of
things
,
within
the
toil
of
a
mournful
and
senseless
delusion
.
The
voice
of
the
surf
heard
now
and
then
was
a
positive
pleasure
,
like
the
speech
of
a
brother
.
It
was
something
natural
,
that
had
its
reason
,
that
had
a
meaning
.
Now
and
then
a
boat
from
the
shore
gave
one
a
momentary
contact
with
reality
.
It
was
paddled
by
black
fellows
.
You
could
see
from
afar
the
white
of
their
eyeballs
glistening
.
They
shouted
,
sang
;
their
bodies
streamed
with
perspiration
;
they
had
faces
like
grotesque
masks
–
these
chaps
;
but
they
had
bone
,
muscle
,
a
wild
vitality
,
an
intense
energy
of
movement
,
that
was
as
natural
and
true
as
the
surf
along
their
coast
.
They
wanted
no
excuse
for
being
there
.
They
were
a
great
comfort
to
look
at
.
For
a
time
I
would
feel
I
belonged
still
to
a
world
of
straightforward
facts
;
but
the
feeling
would
not
last
long
.
Something
would
turn
up
to
scare
it
away
.
Once
,
I
remember
,
we
came
upon
a
man-of-war
anchored
off
the
coast
.
There
was
n't
even
a
shed
there
,
and
she
was
shelling
the
bush
.
It
appears
the
French
had
one
of
their
wars
going
on
thereabouts
.
Her
ensign
dropped
limp
like
a
rag
;
the
muzzles
of
the
long
eight-inch
guns
stuck
out
all
over
the
low
hull
;
the
greasy
,
slimy
swell
swung
her
up
lazily
and
let
her
down
,
swaying
her
thin
masts
.
In
the
empty
immensity
of
earth
,
sky
,
and
water
,
there
she
was
,
incomprehensible
,
firing
into
a
continent
.
Pop
,
would
go
one
of
the
eight-inch
guns
;
a
small
flame
would
dart
and
vanish
,
a
little
white
smoke
would
disappear
,
a
tiny
projectile
would
give
a
feeble
screech
–
and
nothing
happened
.
Nothing
could
happen
.
There
was
a
touch
of
insanity
in
the
proceeding
,
a
sense
of
lugubrious
drollery
in
the
sight
;
and
it
was
not
dissipated
by
somebody
on
board
assuring
me
earnestly
there
was
a
camp
of
natives
–
he
called
them
enemies
!
–
hidden
out
of
sight
somewhere
.
We
gave
her
her
letters
(
I
heard
the
men
in
that
lonely
ship
were
dying
of
fever
at
the
rate
of
three
a
day
)
and
went
on
.
We
called
at
some
more
places
with
farcical
names
,
where
the
merry
dance
of
death
and
trade
goes
on
in
a
still
and
earthy
atmosphere
as
of
an
overheated
catacomb
;
all
along
the
formless
coast
bordered
by
dangerous
surf
,
as
if
Nature
herself
had
tried
to
ward
off
intruders
;
in
and
out
of
rivers
,
streams
of
death
in
life
,
whose
banks
were
rotting
into
mud
,
whose
waters
,
thickened
into
slime
,
invaded
the
contorted
mangroves
,
that
seemed
to
writhe
at
us
in
the
extremity
of
an
impotent
despair
.
Nowhere
did
we
stop
long
enough
to
get
a
particularized
impression
,
but
the
general
sense
of
vague
and
oppressive
wonder
grew
upon
me
.
It
was
like
a
weary
pilgrimage
amongst
hints
for
nightmares
.
It
was
upward
of
thirty
days
before
I
saw
the
mouth
of
the
big
river
.
We
anchored
off
the
seat
of
the
government
.
But
my
work
would
not
begin
till
some
two
hundred
miles
farther
on
.
So
as
soon
as
I
could
I
made
a
start
for
a
place
thirty
miles
higher
up
.
I
had
my
passage
on
a
little
sea-going
steamer
.
Her
captain
was
a
Swede
,
and
knowing
me
for
a
seaman
,
invited
me
on
the
bridge
.
He
was
a
young
man
,
lean
,
fair
,
and
morose
,
with
lanky
hair
and
a
shuffling
gait
.
As
we
left
the
miserable
little
wharf
,
he
tossed
his
head
contemptuously
at
the
shore
.
Been
living
there
?
he
asked
.
I
said
,
Yes
.
Fine
lot
these
government
chaps
–
are
they
not
?
he
went
on
,
speaking
English
with
great
precision
and
considerable
bitterness
.
It
is
funny
what
some
people
will
do
for
a
few
francs
a
month
.
I
wonder
what
becomes
of
that
kind
when
it
goes
up
country
?
I
said
to
him
I
expected
to
see
that
soon
.
So-o-o
!
he
exclaimed
.
He
shuffled
athwart
,
keeping
one
eye
ahead
vigilantly
.
Do
n't
be
too
sure
,
he
continued
.
The
other
day
I
took
up
a
man
who
hanged
himself
on
the
road
.
He
was
a
Swede
,
too
.
Hanged
himself
!
Why
,
in
God
's
name
?
I
cried
.
He
kept
on
looking
out
watchfully
.
Who
knows
?
The
sun
too
much
for
him
,
or
the
country
perhaps
.
At
last
we
opened
a
reach
.
A
rocky
cliff
appeared
,
mounds
of
turned-up
earth
by
the
shore
,
houses
on
a
hill
,
others
,
with
iron
roofs
,
amongst
a
waste
of
excavations
,
or
hanging
to
the
declivity
.
A
continuous
noise
of
the
rapids
above
hovered
over
this
scene
of
inhabited
devastation
.
A
lot
of
people
,
mostly
black
and
naked
,
moved
about
like
ants
.
A
jetty
projected
into
the
river
.
A
blinding
sunlight
drowned
all
this
at
times
in
a
sudden
recrudescence
of
glare
.
There
's
your
Company
's
station
,
said
the
Swede
,
pointing
to
three
wooden
barrack-like
structures
on
the
rocky
slope
.
'
I
will
send
your
things
up
.
Four
boxes
did
you
say
?
So
.
Farewell
.
'
I
came
upon
a
boiler
wallowing
in
the
grass
,
then
found
a
path
leading
up
the
hill
.
It
turned
aside
for
the
bowlders
,
and
also
for
an
undersized
railway-truck
lying
there
on
its
back
with
its
wheels
in
the
air
.
One
was
off
.
The
thing
looked
as
dead
as
the
carcass
of
some
animal
.
I
came
upon
more
pieces
of
decaying
machinery
,
a
stack
of
rusty
rails
.
To
the
left
a
clump
of
trees
made
a
shady
spot
,
where
dark
things
seemed
to
stir
feebly
.
I
blinked
,
the
path
was
steep
.
A
horn
tooted
to
the
right
,
and
I
saw
the
black
people
run
.
A
heavy
and
dull
detonation
shook
the
ground
,
a
puff
of
smoke
came
out
of
the
cliff
,
and
that
was
all
.
No
change
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
rock
.
They
were
building
a
railway
.
The
cliff
was
not
in
the
way
or
anything
;
but
this
objectless
blasting
was
all
the
work
going
on
.
A
slight
clinking
behind
me
made
me
turn
my
head
.
Six
black
men
advanced
in
a
file
,
toiling
up
the
path
.
They
walked
erect
and
slow
,
balancing
small
baskets
full
of
earth
on
their
heads
,
and
the
clink
kept
time
with
their
footsteps
.
Black
rags
were
wound
round
their
loins
,
and
the
short
ends
behind
wagged
to
and
fro
like
tails
.
I
could
see
every
rib
,
the
joints
of
their
limbs
were
like
knots
in
a
rope
;
each
had
an
iron
collar
on
his
neck
,
and
all
were
connected
together
with
a
chain
whose
bights
swung
between
them
,
rhythmically
clinking
.
Another
report
from
the
cliff
made
me
think
suddenly
of
that
ship
of
war
I
had
seen
firing
into
a
continent
.
It
was
the
same
kind
of
ominous
voice
;
but
these
men
could
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
be
called
enemies
.
They
were
called
criminals
,
and
the
outraged
law
,
like
the
bursting
shells
,
had
come
to
them
,
an
insoluble
mystery
from
over
the
sea
.
All
their
meager
breasts
panted
together
,
the
violently
dilated
nostrils
quivered
,
the
eyes
stared
stonily
uphill
.
They
passed
me
within
six
inches
,
without
a
glance
,
with
that
complete
,
deathlike
indifference
of
unhappy
savages
.
Behind
this
raw
matter
one
of
the
reclaimed
,
the
product
of
the
new
forces
at
work
,
strolled
despondently
,
carrying
a
rifle
by
its
middle
.
He
had
a
uniform
jacket
with
one
button
off
,
and
seeing
a
white
man
on
the
path
,
hoisted
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
with
alacrity
.
This
was
simple
prudence
,
white
men
being
so
much
alike
at
a
distance
that
he
could
not
tell
who
I
might
be
.
He
was
speedily
reassured
,
and
with
a
large
,
white
,
rascally
grin
,
and
a
glance
at
his
charge
,
seemed
to
take
me
into
partnership
in
his
exalted
trust
.
After
all
,
I
also
was
a
part
of
the
great
cause
of
these
high
and
just
proceedings
.
Instead
of
going
up
,
I
turned
and
descended
to
the
left
.
My
idea
was
to
let
that
chain-gang
get
out
of
sight
before
I
climbed
the
hill
.
You
know
I
am
not
particularly
tender
;
I
've
had
to
strike
and
to
fend
off
.
I
've
had
to
resist
and
to
attack
sometimes
–
that
's
only
one
way
of
resisting
–
without
counting
the
exact
cost
,
according
to
the
demands
of
such
sort
of
life
as
I
had
blundered
into
.
I
've
seen
the
devil
of
violence
,
and
the
devil
of
greed
,
and
the
devil
of
hot
desire
;
but
,
by
all
the
stars
!
these
were
strong
,
lusty
,
red-eyed
devils
,
that
swayed
and
drove
men
–
men
,
I
tell
you
.
But
as
I
stood
on
this
hillside
,
I
foresaw
that
in
the
blinding
sunshine
of
that
land
I
would
become
acquainted
with
a
flabby
,
pretending
,
weak-eyed
devil
of
a
rapacious
and
pitiless
folly
.
How
insidious
he
could
be
,
too
,
I
was
only
to
find
out
several
months
later
and
a
thousand
miles
farther
.
For
a
moment
I
stood
appalled
,
as
though
by
a
warning
.
Finally
I
descended
the
hill
,
obliquely
,
towards
the
trees
I
had
seen
.
I
avoided
a
vast
artificial
hole
somebody
had
been
digging
on
the
slope
,
the
purpose
of
which
I
found
it
impossible
to
divine
.
It
was
n't
a
quarry
or
a
sandpit
,
anyhow
.
It
was
just
a
hole
.
It
might
have
been
connected
with
the
philanthropic
desire
of
giving
the
criminals
something
to
do
.
I
do
n't
know
.
Then
I
nearly
fell
into
a
very
narrow
ravine
,
almost
no
more
than
a
scar
in
the
hillside
.
I
discovered
that
a
lot
of
imported
drainage-pipes
for
the
settlement
had
been
tumbled
in
there
.
There
was
n't
one
that
was
not
broken
.
It
was
a
wanton
smash-up
.
at
last
I
got
under
the
trees
.
My
purpose
was
to
stroll
into
the
shade
for
a
moment
;
but
no
sooner
within
than
it
seemed
to
me
I
had
stepped
into
a
gloomy
circle
of
some
Inferno
.
The
rapids
were
near
,
and
an
uninterrupted
,
uniform
,
headlong
,
rushing
noise
filled
the
mournful
stillness
of
the
grove
,
where
not
a
breath
stirred
,
not
a
leaf
moved
,
with
a
mysterious
sound
–
as
though
the
tearing
pace
of
the
launched
earth
had
suddenly
become
audible
.
Black
shapes
crouched
,
lay
,
sat
between
the
trees
,
leaning
against
the
trunks
,
clinging
to
the
earth
,
half
coming
out
,
half
effaced
within
the
dim
light
,
in
all
the
attitudes
of
pain
,
abandonment
,
and
despair
.
He
is
waiting
!
'
I
did
not
see
the
real
significance
of
that
wreck
at
once
.
I
fancy
I
see
it
now
,
but
I
am
not
sure
–
not
at
all
.
Certainly
the
affair
was
too
stupid
–
when
I
think
of
it
–
to
be
altogether
natural
.
Still
...
.
But
at
the
moment
it
presented
itself
simply
as
a
confounded
nuisance
.
The
steamer
was
sunk
.
They
had
started
two
days
before
in
a
sudden
hurry
up
the
river
with
the
manager
on
board
,
in
charge
of
some
volunteer
skipper
,
and
before
they
had
been
out
three
hours
they
tore
the
bottom
out
of
her
on
stones
,
and
she
sank
near
the
south
bank
.
I
asked
myself
what
I
was
to
do
there
,
now
my
boat
was
lost
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
had
plenty
to
do
in
fishing
my
command
out
of
the
river
.
I
had
to
set
about
it
the
very
next
day
.
That
,
and
the
repairs
when
I
brought
the
pieces
to
the
station
,
took
some
months
.
My
first
interview
with
the
manager
was
curious
.
He
did
not
ask
me
to
sit
down
after
my
twenty-mile
walk
that
morning
.
He
was
commonplace
in
complexion
,
in
features
,
in
manners
,
and
in
voice
.
He
was
of
middle
size
and
of
ordinary
build
.
His
eyes
,
of
the
usual
blue
,
were
perhaps
remarkably
cold
,
and
he
certainly
could
make
his
glance
fall
on
one
as
trenchant
and
heavy
as
an
axe
.
But
even
at
these
times
the
rest
of
his
person
seemed
to
disclaim
the
intention
.
Otherwise
there
was
only
an
indefinable
,
faint
expression
of
his
lips
,
something
stealthy
–
a
smile
–
not
a
smile
–
I
remember
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
explain
.
It
was
unconscious
,
this
smile
was
,
though
just
after
he
had
said
something
it
got
intensified
for
an
instant
.
It
came
at
the
end
of
his
speeches
like
a
seal
applied
on
the
words
to
make
the
meaning
of
the
commonest
phrase
appear
absolutely
inscrutable
.
He
was
a
common
trader
,
from
his
youth
up
employed
in
these
parts
–
nothing
more
.
He
was
obeyed
,
yet
he
inspired
neither
love
nor
fear
,
nor
even
respect
.
He
inspired
uneasiness
.
That
was
it
!
Uneasiness
.
Not
a
definite
mistrust
–
just
uneasiness
–
nothing
more
.
You
have
no
idea
how
effective
such
a
...
a
...
faculty
can
be
.
He
had
no
genius
for
organizing
,
for
initiative
,
or
for
order
even
.
That
was
evident
in
such
things
as
the
deplorable
state
of
the
station
.
He
had
no
learning
,
and
no
intelligence
.
His
position
had
come
to
him
–
why
?
Perhaps
because
he
was
never
ill
...
He
had
served
three
terms
of
three
years
out
there
...
Because
triumphant
health
in
the
general
rout
of
constitutions
is
a
kind
of
power
in
itself
.
When
he
went
home
on
leave
he
rioted
on
a
large
scale
–
pompously
.
Jack
ashore
–
with
a
difference
–
in
externals
only
.
This
one
could
gather
from
his
casual
talk
.
He
originated
nothing
,
he
could
keep
the
routine
going
–
that
's
all
.
But
he
was
great
.
He
was
great
by
this
little
thing
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
could
control
such
a
man
.
He
never
gave
that
secret
away
.
Perhaps
there
was
nothing
within
him
.
Such
a
suspicion
made
one
pause
–
for
out
there
there
were
no
external
checks
.
Once
when
various
tropical
diseases
had
laid
low
almost
every
agent
in
the
station
,
he
was
heard
to
say
,
'
Men
who
come
out
here
should
have
no
entrails
.
'
He
sealed
the
utterance
with
that
smile
of
his
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
door
opening
into
a
darkness
he
had
in
his
keeping
.
You
fancied
you
had
seen
things
–
but
the
seal
was
on
.
When
annoyed
at
meal-times
by
the
constant
quarrels
of
the
white
men
about
precedence
,
he
ordered
an
immense
round
table
to
be
made
,
for
which
a
special
house
had
to
be
built
.
This
was
the
station
's
mess-room
.
Where
he
sat
was
the
first
place
–
the
rest
were
nowhere
.
One
felt
this
to
be
his
unalterable
conviction
.
He
was
neither
civil
nor
uncivil
.
He
was
quiet
.
He
allowed
his
boy
–
an
overfed
young
negro
from
the
coast
–
to
treat
the
white
men
,
under
his
very
eyes
,
with
provoking
insolence
.
He
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
.
I
had
been
very
long
on
the
road
.
He
could
not
wait
.
Had
to
start
without
me
.
The
up-river
stations
had
to
be
relieved
.
There
had
been
so
many
delays
already
that
he
did
not
know
who
was
dead
and
who
was
alive
,
and
how
they
got
on
–
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
He
paid
no
attention
to
my
explanations
,
and
,
playing
with
a
stick
of
sealing-wax
,
repeated
several
times
that
the
situation
was
'
very
grave
,
very
grave
.
'
There
were
rumors
that
a
very
important
station
was
in
jeopardy
,
and
its
chief
,
Mr.
Kurtz
,
was
ill
.
Hoped
it
was
not
true
.
Mr.
Kurtz
was
...
I
felt
weary
and
irritable
.
Hang
Kurtz
,
I
thought
.
I
interrupted
him
by
saying
I
had
heard
of
Mr.
Kurtz
on
the
coast
.
'
Ah
!
So
they
talk
of
him
down
there
,
he
murmured
to
himself
.
Then
he
began
again
,
assuring
me
Mr.
Kurtz
was
the
best
agent
he
had
,
an
exceptional
man
,
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
Company
;
therefore
I
could
understand
his
anxiety
.
He
was
,
he
said
,
'
very
,
very
uneasy
.
'
Certainly
he
fidgeted
on
his
chair
a
good
deal
,
exclaimed
,
'
Ah
,
Mr.
Kurtz
!
'
broke
the
stick
of
sealing-wax
and
seemed
dumbfounded
by
the
accident
.
Next
thing
he
wanted
to
know
'
how
long
it
would
take
to
'
...
I
interrupted
him
again
.
Being
hungry
,
you
know
,
and
kept
on
my
feet
too
,
I
was
getting
savage
.
'
How
could
I
tell
,
I
said
.
'
I
had
n't
even
seen
the
wreck
yet
–
some
months
,
no
doubt
.
All
this
talk
seemed
to
me
so
futile
.
Some
months
,
he
said
.
'
Well
,
let
us
say
three
months
before
we
can
make
a
start
.
Yes
.
That
ought
to
do
the
affair
.
I
flung
out
of
his
hut
(
he
lived
all
alone
in
a
clay
hut
with
a
sort
of
veranda
)
muttering
to
myself
my
opinion
of
him
.
He
was
a
chattering
idiot
.
Afterwards
I
took
it
back
when
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
startlingly
with
what
extreme
nicety
he
had
estimated
the
time
requisite
for
the
'
affair
.
'
I
went
to
work
the
next
day
,
turning
,
so
to
speak
,
my
back
on
that
station
.
In
that
way
only
it
seemed
to
me
I
could
keep
my
hold
on
the
redeeming
facts
of
life
.
Still
,
one
must
look
about
sometimes
;
and
then
I
saw
this
station
,
these
men
strolling
aimlessly
about
in
the
sunshine
of
the
yard
.
I
asked
myself
sometimes
what
it
all
meant
.
They
wandered
here
and
there
with
their
absurd
long
staves
in
their
hands
,
like
a
lot
of
faithless
pilgrims
bewitched
inside
a
rotten
fence
.
The
word
'
ivory
'
rang
in
the
air
,
was
whispered
,
was
sighed
.
You
would
think
they
were
praying
to
it
.
A
taint
of
imbecile
rapacity
blew
through
it
all
,
like
a
whiff
from
some
corpse
.
By
Jove
!
I
've
never
seen
anything
so
unreal
in
my
life
.
And
outside
,
the
silent
wilderness
surrounding
this
cleared
speck
on
the
earth
struck
me
as
something
great
and
invincible
,
like
evil
or
truth
,
waiting
patiently
for
the
passing
away
of
this
fantastic
invasion
.
Oh
,
these
months
!
Well
,
never
mind
.
Various
things
happened
.
One
evening
a
grass
shed
full
of
calico
,
cotton
prints
,
beads
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
else
,
burst
into
a
blaze
so
suddenly
that
you
would
have
thought
the
earth
had
opened
to
let
an
avenging
fire
consume
all
that
trash
.
I
was
smoking
my
pipe
quietly
by
my
dismantled
steamer
,
and
saw
them
all
cutting
capers
in
the
light
,
with
their
arms
lifted
high
,
when
the
stout
man
with
mustaches
came
tearing
down
to
the
river
,
a
tin
pail
in
his
hand
,
assured
me
that
everybody
was
'
behaving
splendidly
,
splendidly
,
'
dipped
about
a
quart
of
water
and
tore
back
again
.
I
noticed
there
was
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
his
pail
.
I
strolled
up
.
There
was
no
hurry
.
You
see
the
thing
had
gone
off
like
a
box
of
matches
.
It
had
been
hopeless
from
the
very
first
.
The
flame
had
leaped
high
,
driven
everybody
back
,
lighted
up
everything
–
and
collapsed
.
The
shed
was
already
a
heap
of
embers
glowing
fiercely
.
A
nigger
was
being
beaten
near
by
.
They
said
he
had
caused
the
fire
in
some
way
;
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
was
screeching
most
horribly
.
I
saw
him
,
later
on
,
for
several
days
,
sitting
in
a
bit
of
shade
looking
very
sick
and
trying
to
recover
himself
:
afterwards
he
arose
and
went
out
–
and
the
wilderness
without
a
sound
took
him
into
its
bosom
again
.
As
I
approached
the
glow
from
the
dark
I
found
myself
at
the
back
of
two
men
,
talking
.
I
heard
the
name
of
Kurtz
pronounced
,
then
the
words
,
'
take
advantage
of
this
unfortunate
accident
.
'
One
of
the
men
was
the
manager
.
I
wished
him
a
good
evening
.
Did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
–
eh
?
it
is
incredible
,
he
said
,
and
walked
off
.
The
other
man
remained
.
He
was
a
first-class
agent
,
young
,
gentlemanly
,
a
bit
reserved
,
with
a
forked
little
beard
and
a
hooked
nose
.
He
was
stand-offish
with
the
other
agents
,
and
they
on
their
side
said
he
was
the
manager
's
spy
upon
them
.
As
to
me
,
I
had
hardly
ever
spoken
to
him
before
.
We
got
into
talk
,
and
by-and-by
we
strolled
away
from
the
hissing
ruins
.
Then
he
asked
me
to
his
room
,
which
was
in
the
main
building
of
the
station
.
He
struck
a
match
,
and
I
perceived
that
this
young
aristocrat
had
not
only
a
silver-mounted
dressing-case
but
also
a
whole
candle
all
to
himself
.
Just
at
that
time
the
manager
was
the
only
man
supposed
to
have
any
right
to
candles
.
Native
mats
covered
the
clay
walls
;
a
collection
of
spears
,
assegais
,
shields
,
knives
was
hung
up
in
trophies
.
The
business
intrusted
to
this
fellow
was
the
making
of
bricks
–
so
I
had
been
informed
;
but
there
was
n't
a
fragment
of
a
brick
anywhere
in
the
station
,
and
he
had
been
there
more
than
a
year
–
waiting
.
It
seems
he
could
not
make
bricks
without
something
,
I
do
n't
know
what
–
straw
maybe
.
Anyways
,
it
could
not
be
found
there
,
and
as
it
was
not
likely
to
be
sent
from
Europe
,
it
did
not
appear
clear
to
me
what
he
was
waiting
for
.
An
act
of
special
creation
perhaps
.
However
,
they
were
all
waiting
–
all
the
sixteen
or
twenty
pilgrims
of
them
–
for
something
;
and
upon
my
word
it
did
not
seem
an
uncongenial
occupation
,
from
the
way
they
took
it
,
though
the
only
thing
that
ever
came
to
them
was
disease
–
as
far
as
I
could
see
.
They
beguiled
the
time
by
backbiting
and
intriguing
against
each
other
in
a
foolish
kind
of
way
.
There
was
an
air
of
plotting
about
that
station
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
,
of
course
.
It
was
as
unreal
as
everything
else
–
as
the
philanthropic
pretense
of
the
whole
concern
,
as
their
talk
,
as
their
government
,
as
their
show
of
work
.
The
only
real
feeling
was
a
desire
to
get
appointed
to
a
trading-post
where
ivory
was
to
be
had
,
so
that
they
could
earn
percentages
.
They
intrigued
and
slandered
and
hated
each
other
only
on
that
account
,
–
but
as
to
effectually
lifting
a
little
finger
–
oh
,
no
.
By
heavens
!
there
is
something
after
all
in
the
world
allowing
one
man
to
steal
a
horse
while
another
must
not
look
at
a
halter
.
Steal
a
horse
straight
out
.
Very
well
.
He
has
done
it
.
Perhaps
he
can
ride
.
But
there
is
a
way
of
looking
at
a
halter
that
would
provoke
the
most
charitable
of
saints
into
a
kick
.
From
this
standpoint
,
the
evaluation
of
the
implementation
of
the
budget
may
take
on
a
dimension
that
overrides
matters
of
detail
.
Errors
of
legality
and
regularity
are
increasing
too
.
The
vote
will
take
place
tomorrow
at
12
noon
.
The
main
importance
of
this
agreement
lies
,
I
think
,
in
its
political
nature
.
The
Council
is
extremely
concerned
at
the
latest
developments
in
the
Middle
Eastern
peace
process
.
Otherwise
we
will
find
ourselves
forced
to
take
more
serious
decisions
as
regards
our
trading
relations
with
Israel
.
Ojala
recommendation
for
second
reading
(
A4-0072/97
)
British
Conservatives
also
believe
that
the
Commission
is
wrong
to
bring
forward
this
proposal
in
the
name
of
the
European
Single
Market
.
Within
the
European
Union
,
resale
right
exists
in
the
legislation
of
eleven
Member
States
,
but
it
is
only
really
applied
in
eight
.
This
report
is
no
exception
.
There
are
several
reasons
for
this
.
The
European
Commission
maintains
that
everything
depends
on
supply
.
For
the
longer
term
,
the
preparatory
mission
recommended
economic
and
financial
aid
to
Albania
.
Greece
,
Italy
,
France
,
Spain
and
Austria
,
have
understood
that
something
has
to
be
done
and
now
have
a
presence
in
Albania
.
The
European
Union
is
not
a
military
organization
.
Many
aspects
of
the
transition
have
already
been
successfully
debated
and
worked
out
,
for
example
continuity
in
Kong
's
civil
service
.
The
European
Union
's
economic
interests
in
Hong-Kong
are
both
large
in
scale
and
deep-rooted
.
I
assure
the
House
firmly
that
Hong-Kong
will
not
slip
from
our
sights
in
the
Commission
.
An
unsuccessful
transition
will
equally
damage
us
all
.
I
also
want
to
express
my
disagreement
on
the
support
given
to
the
American
law
on
Hong-Kong
.
Let
us
say
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
put
technical
make-up
on
the
political
face
.
That
is
the
line
taken
in
the
reports
before
you
today
.
We
know
that
the
refiners
already
have
refineries
producing
clean
diesel
,
but
not
for
Europe
.
For
the
United
States
and
Japan
.
It
is
precisely
when
engines
are
claimed
to
be
environment-friendly
because
they
consume
less
fuel
that
we
can
not
make
any
exceptions
.
It
needs
greater
definition
on
the
issue
of
what
is
to
be
done
at
Community
level
in
terms
of
employment
policy
.
Subject
:
The
cost
of
enlargement
Everyone
knows
that
it
is
politically
impossible
to
turn
to
the
Member
States
and
ask
for
an
increase
in
the
Membership
fee
.
The
sum
of
12
million
ECU
has
been
made
available
for
possible
initiatives
agreed
with
Cyprus
for
projects
to
promote
confidence-building
measures
.
Naturally
,
the
Turkish
Cypriots
will
have
a
place
in
the
representation
of
the
lawful
and
internationally
recognized
government
of
Cyprus
.
Question
No-6
by
Mr
Pirker
(
H-0218/97
)
Subject
:
Europol
No
major
obstacles
to
ratification
have
been
reported
.
How
long
will
the
transitional
period
be
following
Polish
accession
in
the
case
of
the
free
movement
of
persons
?
This
procedure
guarantees
that
all
countries
applying
for
membership
are
treated
equally
.
I
would
remind
you
that
the
negotiations
with
Spain
and
Portugal
lasted
seven
years
.
This
appears
to
be
the
case
with
the
events
which
Mr
Lomas
reports
in
his
question
.
These
statements
are
widely
reported
in
the
press
.
Even
civil
servants
at
national
and
local
government
level
in
Britain
are
not
allowed
to
get
involved
in
electioneering
as
the
Commissioners
are
doing
.
Do
you
not
think
some
of
them
,
not
all
,
are
getting
too
big
for
their
boots
.
Also
adopted
was
Directive
96/23
on
supervisory
measures
for
implementing
this
tougher
policy
.
Subject
:
The
EU
as
an
association
of
free
and
independent
States
If
I
understand
the
interpreting
correctly
it
seems
that
Mr
Sjöstedt
himself
believes
that
national
constitutions
are
more
important
than
Community
law
.
Question
No-15
by
Mr
Medina
Ortega
(
H-0237/97
)
It
will
also
give
us
a
future
in
the
two
very
important
industries
that
we
can
not
ignore
and
ensure
Europe
's
future
prosperity
.
Also
,
some
serious
targets
must
now
finally
be
set
for
the
car
industry
.
We
have
done
considerable
research
before
coming
to
the
conclusions
before
us
tonight
.
STOA
,
to
produce
for
us
a
paper
which
indicated
low
sulphur
fuels
are
essential
.
Secondly
,
in
any
case
,
they
have
to
refurbish
and
invest
in
their
refineries
continuously
.
The
rapporteur
is
asking
for
a
threshold
of
50
to
30
ppm
,
which
would
also
involve
excessive
cost
without
appreciable
benefit
.
The
fiscal
advantages
for
clean
vehicles
could
then
be
introduced
some
two
years
before
the
new
standards
take
effect
.
It
emerged
from
the
hearing
that
the
sulphur
content
,
in
particular
,
of
both
petrol
and
diesel
could
be
much
lower
.
A
further
nine
percent
can
be
eliminated
over
the
next
eight
years
,
at
a
reasonable
cost
.
Madam
President
,
there
are
only
two
ways
to
improve
air
quality
.
But
two
groups
are
in
confrontation
.
We
look
forward
to
what
the
Commission
has
to
say
but
I
would
sound
a
note
of
warning
.
The
car
concept
has
got
off
to
a
good
start
.
What
was
the
actual
driving
force
behind
this
programme
?
We
will
change
this
programme
so
that
the
driving
force
behind
it
is
the
future
and
innovation
.
In
the
proposal
for
a
directive
,
summer
begins
on
1
April
and
ends
on
30
September
.
The
report
contains
a
number
of
proposals
for
tax
concessions
which
many
other
speakers
have
mentioned
in
this
evening
's
debate
.
For
that
reason
the
Commission
believes
that
it
is
still
too
early
to
fix
limit
values
for
fuel
quality
for
the
year
2005
.
These
are
Amendments
Nos
22
,
23
,
37
and
38
.
The
Commission
has
proposed
fuel
specifications
for
the
year
2000
.
Madam
President
,
there
has
clearly
been
a
misunderstanding
.
The
vote
will
take
place
tomorrow
at
12
noon
.
And
the
national
judges
frequently
have
difficulty
in
understanding
and
applying
the
concept
of
indirect
discrimination
.
The
directive
codifies
the
case
law
of
the
Court
of
Justice
and
ensures
that
it
will
be
consistently
applied
.
British
women
too
are
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
all
the
other
citizens
of
Europe
.
She
has
already
spoken
on
the
subject
,
and
other
colleagues
will
be
doing
so
as
well
.
What
is
being
asked
of
small
employers
here
is
very
difficult
.
All
of
us
as
MEPs
are
small
employers
too
.
in
order
to
bring
immediate
results
it
will
also
be
necessary
to
have
constant
monitoring
of
the
implementation
of
the
directive
.
The
problems
caused
by
the
absence
of
transparency
are
particularly
severe
.
As
a
final
point
I
emphasize
that
the
existing
positive
actions
must
be
kept
in
place
.
Shared
responsibilities
,
both
at
work
and
in
the
family
mean
a
better
quality
of
life
for
both
men
and
women
.
That
was
also
mentioned
by
Mrs
Oomen-Ruijten
and
Mrs
Glase
.
The
Minutes
of
the
part-session
of
Thursday
29
May
1997
have
been
distributed
.
Why
do
I
raise
the
matter
?
I
give
the
floor
to
Mrs
Green
.
Thursday
does
not
seem
like
a
good
idea
.
Mr
President
,
my
report
also
concerns
agriculture
,
bee-keeping
to
be
precise
.
In
other
words
,
not
your
report
.
Petitions
1996-1997
Citizens
take
their
right
to
petition
seriously
.
Sadly
my
report
is
not
all
plaudits
.
I
wonder
whether
they
are
in
the
debate
this
evening
.
In
that
case
,
the
matter
turns
out
to
be
a
national
problem
after
all
.
It
is
possible
when
the
matter
is
raised
with
the
Committee
on
Petitions
.
So
it
is
essential
that
we
activate
this
right
fully
.
He
won
a
case
against
the
Greek
railways
several
years
ago
and
he
is
owed
several
thousand
pounds
by
them
.
Thank
you
very
much
,
Commissioner
.
We
have
shown
that
the
future
of
the
audio-visual
industry
is
a
debate
which
crosses
all
political
and
national
boundaries
.
We
must
be
able
to
create
and
see
our
own
stories
,
be
it
Inspector
Morse
or
Derrick
.
We
can
not
accept
that
situation
.
The
first
reading
provided
a
remedy
.
As
far
as
I
know
,
Madam
President
,
lies
are
not
accepted
in
any
parliament
.
Copyright
and
the
EU
's
principle
of
free
competition
should
be
taken
into
account
in
the
televising
of
sports
as
of
other
events
.
Which
will
be
seen
and
which
not
?
Thanks
to
all
this
it
will
now
be
more
difficult
for
public
and
private
broadcasters
to
ignore
the
rules
contained
in
the
directive
.
For
European
citizens
,
it
ensures
that
the
public
interest
is
taken
into
consideration
,
which
is
so
important
to
their
daily
lives
.
Thank
you
very
much
,
Commissioner
.
Our
fellow
citizens
'
days
and
nights
are
becoming
increasingly
noisy
.
Two
months
ago
I
had
to
have
an
operation
for
a
serious
complaint
.
No
doubt
much
of
what
our
citizens
experience
as
noise
does
not
fall
within
the
competence
of
the
Union
.
And
this
is
one
of
the
oldest
pieces
of
environmental
legislation
that
we
have
in
Europe
.
I
am
thinking
here
of
airport
zones
,
high-speed
trains
and
major
motorways
.
This
refusal
can
be
interpreted
as
indirect
encouragement
of
the
impunity
and
immunity
of
the
terrorists
of
yesterday
,
today
and
tomorrow
.
Resignation
of
a
Vice-President
The
next
item
is
the
order
of
business
.
I
would
remind
you
that
Mr
Cornelissen
's
report
has
been
added
to
the
agenda
for
Tuesday
.
I
hope
she
will
take
note
of
this
,
because
it
is
an
important
point
.
(
The
President
cut
off
the
speaker
)
The
next
item
is
the
joint
debate
on
the
following
statement
and
oral
question
:
For
this
reason
,
the
initiative
of
the
Commission
is
worthy
of
our
congratulations
.
My
group
,
the
Liberal
group
,
is
presently
focusing
its
attention
on
non-European
Union
nationals
.
They
are
no
longer
allowed
to
practise
their
previous
activities
as
doctors
,
teachers
,
members
of
parliament
.
Madam
President
,
I
would
also
like
to
thank
Mrs
Bonino
wholeheartedly
for
her
work
on
behalf
of
the
women
in
Kabul
.
Barbaric
violence
can
only
be
fought
when
democracy
is
supported
.
The
debate
is
closed
.
There
have
only
been
a
few
isolated
amendments
opposed
to
this
approach
and
these
were
subsequently
rejected
.
Madam
President
,
my
group
supports
the
rapporteur
's
position
.
I
fully
support
the
need
for
contacts
with
third
countries
.
Secondly
,
we
should
not
allow
this
to
be
postponed
indefinitely
,
and
we
should
not
introduce
provisions
restricted
to
physical
persons
.
But
that
is
not
the
language
used
in
everyday
encounters
with
the
bemused
populations
of
the
EU
countries
.
Two
approaches
are
becoming
clear
,
one
of
which
is
a
pragmatic
approach
.
Have
negotiations
really
begun
?
Today
we
have
two
directives
before
us
,
including
this
one
on
capital
income
.
Finally
,
it
is
my
belief
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
deal
with
rate
levels
.
I
believe
this
is
a
job
for
the
final
compromise
round
of
Europe
's
finance
ministers
.
Where
coordinating
tax
policy
is
concerned
,
the
main
objective
is
to
limit
manoeuvring
and
distortions
on
the
capital
markets
.
My
country
is
one
of
them
.
Yet
another
amendment
is
aimed
at
simplification
,
taking
references
to
the
tank
to
include
its
accessories
as
a
matter
of
course
.
The
sitting
was
suspended
at
11.25
a.m.
until
voting
time
at
11.30
a.m.
.
Your
predecessor
said
earlier
–
we
only
finished
the
debate
barely
twenty
minutes
ago
–
that
this
report
would
be
voted
on
tomorrow
.
Now
we
come
to
the
references
to
Macao
.
In
the
motion
for
a
resolution
,
we
have
:
The
way
China
develops
is
vital
for
the
way
our
own
societies
develop
.
It
will
influence
not
only
our
economies
but
also
,
and
above
all
,
prospects
for
democracy
world-wide
.
Directive
96/96/EC
established
the
principle
that
commercial
road
vehicles
must
undergo
an
annual
roadworthiness
test
at
an
approved
testing
centre
.
However
,
I
seriously
doubt
that
the
introduction
of
free
market
principles
,
which
the
report
so
enthusiastically
recommends
,
is
the
right
solution
.
It
would
not
be
a
good
thing
to
blindly
apply
competition
rules
and
risk
endangering
the
efficiency
of
Community
and
national
interventions
.
In
addition
,
the
Commission
has
exclusive
competence
in
matters
of
state
aid
.
In
its
communication
,
the
Commission
has
presented
some
proposals
for
greater
consistency
between
regional
policy
and
competition
policy
in
the
EU
.
This
solution
must
not
become
entrenched
in
a
national-level
mentality
.
The
Commission
has
already
established
a
number
of
actions
to
help
them
.
It
concentrates
on
combating
unemployment
and
ensuring
that
everyone
has
a
job
.
No
one
is
left
out
;
there
are
clear
references
to
women
,
for
example
.
It
is
heartening
that
the
European
Union
recognises
the
problems
and
is
willing
to
focus
on
them
.
Let
us
make
it
clear
that
the
collection
of
clothing
for
people
in
third
countries
who
need
it
can
continue
.
We
must
accept
that
.
The
problem
is
that
in
many
EU
Member
States
it
has
become
the
easy
option
with
dire
consequences
for
the
environment
.
I
reserve
my
right
to
come
back
on
this
when
it
goes
back
to
committee
.
On
the
question
of
whether
to
exempt
energy-intensive
industries
,
in
our
view
the
Commission
's
proposal
has
advantages
and
disadvantages
.
The
international
exemption
for
aircraft
kerosene
must
be
abolished
as
quickly
as
possible
.
The
indexing
of
minimum
rates
introduced
by
Mr
Cox
is
a
good
way
of
making
the
regulation
simple
and
reliable
.
As
a
result
,
the
legislation
is
complex
,
hard
to
understand
and
difficult
to
apply
.
Standards
have
been
raised
,
and
the
question
of
the
radio
ham
has
also
been
given
attention
.
If
I
have
a
criticism
of
the
Legal
Affairs
Committee
's
opinion
,
it
is
that
it
is
too
one-sided
.
I
salute
him
for
all
he
has
done
in
this
area
.
A
further
point
was
how
private
copying
should
be
regulated
in
the
digital
environment
.
Broad
sections
of
the
population
having
access
to
these
new
forms
of
knowledge
and
learning
is
something
we
should
very
much
welcome
.
It
is
a
directive
which
safeguards
the
interests
of
rightholders
and
protects
intellectual
property
.
That
is
why
the
Socialist
Group
will
be
supporting
this
position
.
The
first
concerns
the
limitations
on
copyright
,
in
which
context
we
have
logically
proposed
providing
compensation
.
In
the
first
place
,
there
are
the
creators
.
There
are
no
clearly
defined
rules
governing
the
sharing
of
responsibility
.
Cultural
differences
do
exist
,
and
so
I
do
not
understand
why
there
should
not
be
mandatory
provision
for
exemptions
.
Some
time
ago
we
debated
about
giving
the
rights
to
artists
who
sell
their
artwork
.
Since
that
legislation
came
into
being
,
there
has
been
no
noticeable
difference
.
There
is
a
proper
balanced
way
to
achieve
the
rights
that
everybody
here
wants
to
see
.
What
is
most
needed
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
other
areas
,
is
a
serious
in
depth
analysis
of
the
problems
.
This
is
a
right
which
does
not
incur
financial
consequences
.
Mr
President
,
many
thanks
to
Mr
Barzanti
.
We
are
told
we
must
balance
interests
but
,
quite
frankly
,
all
interests
are
not
equal
.
Blank
screens
will
not
enrich
our
society
.
Too
many
continue
to
scrape
together
a
living
in
a
kind
of
La
Bohéme
garret
.
Some
would
argue
that
there
should
be
fair
use
without
fair
compensation
.
Allow
the
creators
and
others
in
the
United
Kingdom
to
have
a
fair
debate
about
whether
we
should
have
a
blank
tape
levy
.
Copyright
holders
are
given
an
absolute
right
to
protection
,
with
the
banning
of
copying
for
private
use
for
example
.
Let
us
be
honest
.
It
may
seem
that
the
common
agricultural
policy
or
the
trans-European
transport
network
are
higher
priorities
,
but
they
are
not
.
If
these
products
are
in
short
supply
or
of
inferior
quality
,
that
will
sound
the
death-knell
for
Europe
.
There
are
some
very
clear
examples
of
this
in
the
recitals
.
The
ball
is
now
in
the
Commission
's
court
.
At
one
time
,
almost
all
Europe
's
major
hits
came
into
being
with
the
help
of
a
producer
who
believed
in
them
.
We
feel
that
the
Internet
provides
an
effective
way
of
avoiding
that
stranglehold
.
The
information
society
is
in
fact
evolving
in
a
global
context
.
I
am
well
aware
that
this
was
also
the
aim
of
Parliament
's
work
.
We
can
not
,
however
,
accept
the
concept
of
'
economic
significance
'
for
the
rightholder
.
Your
amendments
uphold
two
important
principles
:
the
right
of
rightholders
to
fair
remuneration
and
the
fine
distinction
concerning
private
digital
copies
.
The
first
principle
protects
a
need
for
equity
;
it
is
a
measured
step
forwards
in
the
quest
for
legal
certainty
in
this
sector
.
That
is
a
formula
which
allows
broader
harmonisation
and
respects
the
traditions
and
practices
of
the
Member
States
.
The
vote
will
be
taken
tomorrow
at
12
noon
.
C4-0497/98-98/0126
(
CNS
)
.
The
very
structure
of
the
text
of
the
COM
in
wine
shows
us
that
wine
is
an
agricultural
product
rather
than
an
industrial
product
.
Mr
President
,
I
should
like
to
start
by
offering
my
sincere
thanks
to
Mr
Martin
.
The
proposal
,
Commissioner
Fischler
,
was
also
not
nearly
as
good
as
this
one
.
Circumstances
have
changed
in
some
respects
,
while
in
others
they
have
remained
the
same
.
That
is
why
we
support
the
Agriculture
Committee
's
call
for
a
framework
regulation
.
Each
area
has
its
own
way
of
making
wine
.
We
will
only
counter
overproduction
by
introducing
comprehensive
new
quality
criteria
.
We
support
Mr
Martin
's
report
and
we
say
one
thing
:
quality
not
quantity
!
Contrary
to
the
Commission
proposals
,
we
must
preserve
the
current
procedure
known
as
the
Article
43
procedure
.
That
is
the
information
I
have
on
this
type
of
activity
.
You
have
the
floor
,
Mr
Van
Miert
.
Mr
President
,
there
has
been
considerable
progress
made
with
regard
to
the
internal
market
for
medicinal
products
.
It
will
be
borne
by
the
consumers
and
will
constitute
an
additional
element
of
the
price
of
electricity
used
.
I
should
just
like
to
confirm
that
the
Commissioner
and
the
French
Minister
for
Europe
are
both
agreed
on
that
point
.
I
was
obviously
anxious
to
hear
the
speech
in
full
,
In
any
case
,
I
congratulate
Mrs
Thors
on
her
French
;
I
certainly
can
not
speak
in
Swedish
or
Finnish
.
Once
again
,
it
is
a
question
of
habit
.
This
also
applies
to
charges
on
cross-border
transfers
.
We
have
done
so
:
on
5
February
we
published
an
extremely
detailed
press
release
dealing
with
the
questions
you
have
raised
.
I
will
bear
in
mind
however
,
as
these
debates
are
of
especial
interest
to
me
,
that
Spain
has
been
particularly
affected
.
Question
No-46
by
Christine
Oddy
(
H-0002/99
)
I
am
pleased
to
confirm
that
the
Commission
has
received
the
report
to
which
the
honourable
Member
refers
.
Mr
Hatzidakis
now
has
the
floor
for
one
minute
,
and
his
will
be
the
last
question
to
Mr
van
den
Broek
today
.
As
regards
the
negotiations
,
you
know
the
Commission
's
position
.
Question
No-59
by
Alex
Smith
(
H-0045/99
)
I
must
confess
I
am
totally
surprised
that
the
Commission
was
not
aware
of
this
report
,
given
its
sensitivity
at
this
particular
time
.
So
I
do
not
have
a
supplementary
question
,
I
just
want
to
register
my
protest
.
My
question
is
related
to
Mr
Smith
's
question
.
It
has
always
failed
to
deal
with
the
real
issue
,
namely
the
closing-down
of
Sellafield
.
I
have
sat
here
patiently
and
I
find
it
quite
extraordinary
that
you
are
not
calling
me
.
Instead
of
that
,
you
called
Mr
Fitzsimons
as
a
supplementary
to
Mr
Smith
.
I
have
the
impression
that
the
honourable
Member
believes
the
public
invitation
to
tender
in
connection
with
the
tunnel
has
already
started
.
The
sitting
was
suspended
at
7.15
p.m
and
resumed
at
9
p.m
.
Common
organisation
of
the
market
in
wine
(
continuation
)
I
also
think
that
the
Commission
's
proposals
are
better
able
to
provide
this
guarantee
of
dynamic
equilibrium
.
This
also
means
that
in
several
areas
the
report
does
not
follow
the
liberal
proposals
made
by
the
Commission
.
Everyone
can
see
that
the
draft
CAP
reforms
tend
to
become
embedded
in
the
rut
defined
by
the
Commission
's
too
liberal
tendencies
.
The
Committee
on
Agriculture
and
Rural
Development
is
very
attentive
to
the
demands
of
the
experts
and
of
society
.
This
is
why
we
will
be
approving
the
report
which
has
been
presented
to
us
.
I
hope
that
the
debate
on
wine-growing
will
benefit
the
wine
producer
,
the
product
and
the
consumer
alike
.
More
must
be
done
to
promote
the
product
on
the
international
markets
.
We
are
always
talking
about
quality
;
well
,
I
believe
that
quality
also
means
giving
priority
to
products
wholly
derived
from
the
vine
.
Unfortunately
,
with
respect
,
it
shows
an
enormous
ignorance
of
what
actually
happens
to
wine
in
those
countries
that
it
is
shipped
to
.
Ladies
and
gentlemen
from
both
North
and
South
,
we
must
vote
in
favour
of
this
report
.
Commissioner
Brittan
should
know
this
.
The
appropriate
forum
for
the
settlement
of
this
dispute
is
the
World
Trade
Organisation
.
I
therefore
urge
the
German
presidency
to
take
whatever
initiative
is
necessary
in
the
Bonn
EU/US
summit
in
June
.
It
is
as
if
someone
were
to
steal
my
wallet
and
I
were
then
expected
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
with
him
.
So
,
let
us
take
the
gloves
off
.
We
shall
not
only
condemn
them
.
It
affects
people
and
it
reaches
them
at
different
times
and
on
different
issues
.
I
can
now
give
the
floor
to
one
speaker
in
favour
and
one
against
.
A
pirate
electronic
version
is
available
but
not
in
French
.
In
addition
to
the
Structural
Funds
and
the
common
agricultural
policy
,
the
financing
of
the
Community
needs
to
undergo
radical
reform
.
President
Santer
rightly
pointed
out
that
financial
reform
is
one
of
the
main
pillars
of
Agenda
2000
.
You
can
see
that
just
by
looking
at
the
current
discussions
in
the
Council
.
Work
that
one
out
if
you
can
!
At
the
same
time
that
one
truly
European
own
resource
is
waning
rapidly
in
its
importance
.
Yet
,
the
good
old
traditional
own
resources
are
the
cause
of
major
headaches
for
control
and
concern
about
fraud
.
We
have
a
system
of
own
resources
that
is
extremely
complex
and
lacking
in
transparency
.
It
makes
life
very
difficult
for
Members
,
Commissioners
and
the
press
.
At
any
rate
,
there
is
still
quite
a
lot
of
circumvention
and
evasion
in
this
area
by
the
Member
States
.
Mr
President
,
I
should
also
like
to
compliment
Mrs
Haug
on
her
report
.
These
are
very
fundamental
points
for
the
future
.
It
is
a
question
of
appropriateness
and
of
review
.
What
policies
and
at
what
level
?
Only
one
thing
can
protect
us
from
this
unfortunate
fate
and
that
is
the
rule
of
unanimity
.
I
should
like
to
welcome
Mrs
Cresson
and
ask
her
to
reply
to
Mr
Valverde
's
question
.
Thank
you
very
much
.
The
premises
you
visited
do
not
belong
to
the
European
Commission
and
the
staff
you
met
are
not
employed
by
the
European
Commission
.
I
am
unaware
of
the
reasons
behind
this
situation
you
describe
though
I
can
make
an
educated
guess
at
them
.
Could
you
please
explain
it
more
clearly
?
What
I
have
been
hearing
about
the
representative
in
Nicaragua
is
indicative
that
the
project
had
not
been
properly
closed
down
.
I
would
like
to
make
that
crystal-clear
.
I
am
referring
to
the
Rio
Coco
project
.
Mr
Martin
,
please
reply
without
engaging
in
a
dialogue
,
as
the
Rules
do
not
provide
for
one
.
Originally
,
a
proposal
was
promised
for
the
beginning
of
last
year
.
I
am
grateful
to
the
honourable
Member
for
his
question
.
I
just
hope
that
I
will
be
invited
to
the
opening
ceremony
because
we
worked
damned
hard
to
get
it
.
Thank
you
,
Mr
Kinnock
.
Question
No-44
by
Bernie
Malone
(
H-0209/99
)
European
exports
rose
during
that
period
but
the
situation
has
now
been
rectified
.
The
only
product
of
any
significance
is
canned
tomatoes
,
but
even
they
account
for
no
more
than
7
-%
of
the
market
.
For
my
part
,
I
feel
that
the
negotiations
were
balanced
and
that
they
open
the
way
for
achieving
a
sustainable
market
.
You
know
yourself
that
the
agreement
with
South
Africa
was
held
up
because
of
the
fisheries
question
,
too
.
You
have
to
take
more
into
account
the
whole
question
of
,
not
just
giving
aid
,
but
fair
trade
.
The
overall
amount
was
6500
tonnes
of
canned
tomatoes
.
We
shall
be
discussing
the
new
trends
in
consumption
and
trafficking
and
the
prospects
for
the
future
.
Many
lives
are
wasted
every
year
because
of
the
depredations
of
the
people-smugglers
.
We
know
for
certain
that
those
who
try
to
reach
the
coast
of
Europe
by
sea
from
Morocco
often
meet
a
grim
fate
.
In
1996
,
the
EDU
's
mandate
was
extended
to
include
the
smuggling
of
human
beings
.
We
know
that
there
are
boats
plying
between
Morocco
and
Spain
and
Gibraltar
,
and
that
the
different
authorities
concerned
are
cooperating
fully
.
What
do
you
think
are
the
target
routes
here
?
Question
No-49
will
therefore
receive
a
written
answer
.
We
are
closely
monitoring
the
matter
and
should
know
whether
the
regime
has
been
modified
within
the
next
few
weeks
.
Secondly
,
the
origin
rules
applicable
to
imports
to
third
countries
from
the
Community
are
still
based
on
individual
Member
States
.
Detailed
statistics
on
EU
trade
with
Cuba
are
not
available
.
I
understand
from
sources
in
the
Scottish
industry
that
there
is
a
major
company
involved
in
Norway
at
the
moment
.
As
I
have
said
,
84
exporters
have
had
the
undertakings
replaced
by
duties
instead
.
This
has
led
to
the
adoption
of
a
common
position
on
Burma
and
the
withdrawal
of
GSP
benefits
.
In
this
case
we
are
talking
about
the
market
for
processed
meat
products
.
I
had
therefore
been
hoping
for
a
common
sense
reply
,
Commissioner
,
not
a
technical
one
.
The
directive
is
more
modest
.
How
could
millions
of
customers
be
reimbursed
if
the
charge
had
already
been
included
in
their
electricity
bills
?
Questions
Nos
60
to
111
will
therefore
receive
written
answers
.
That
concludes
Question
Time
.
For
electoral
reasons
and
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
masses
,
the
subject
has
been
brought
up
again
.
It
aims
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
,
as
Agenda
2000
negotiations
have
reached
a
critical
stage
.
The
issue
is
the
financing
of
EU
enlargement
.
We
are
now
fighting
over
who
is
going
to
pay
for
it
.
I
speak
on
behalf
of
the
British
Labour
Members
on
that
major
area
of
dissent
.
At
the
moment
,
Germany
has
a
massive
surplus
in
its
balance
of
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
Union
,
something
like
25
billion
.
Firstly
,
does
the
total
amount
of
Community
budget
receipts
cover
the
current
requirement
of
the
European
Union
?
How
much
further
do
you
want
it
to
fall
?
Let
us
just
reflect
on
the
fact
that
,
without
a
common
agricultural
policy
,
there
would
be
no
European
Union
today
.
We
therefore
had
to
meet
these
two
fundamental
objectives
and
I
sincerely
believe
that
we
are
close
to
achieving
this
.
Some
merely
refer
to
purely
linguistic
and
formal
aspects
.
We
transport
politicians
always
try
to
be
precise
,
without
letting
things
get
out
of
hand
.
During
the
conciliation
procedure
the
Commission
,
indeed
you
,
Commissioner
,
declared
that
a
proposal
on
seaports
would
be
on
the
table
immediately
.
There
are
two
other
points
I
would
like
to
address
.
Then
there
is
the
famous
project
No-8
of
the
14
very
important
projects
endorsed
by
the
Essen
summit
.
We
have
worked
on
the
networks
too
long
for
this
to
happen
.
That
is
what
I
want
to
talk
about
today
.
I
admit
that
,
Commissioner
,
and
also
thank
the
Commission
for
improving
its
proposal
compared
to
the
original
text
.
We
need
a
brief
report
summarising
the
experience
gained
and
a
clear
review
.
A
very
clear
and
accurate
analysis
of
both
Mediterranean
and
non-Mediterranean
ports
is
required
.
That
makes
sense
because
the
viability
of
infrastructure
investments
obviously
depends
on
competitive
revenue-raising
services
and
competitive
services
clearly
need
quality
infrastructure
.
Amendment
No-6
makes
more
radical
changes
to
the
guideline
maps
,
adding
new
links
and
creating
new
categories
of
ports
.
All
I
would
regret
was
his
prolonged
absence
from
this
House
.
This
,
however
,
is
not
the
proposal
before
the
House
.
That
he
always
gets
,
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
.
Thank
you
,
Mr
Kinnock
.
There
is
much
talk
of
privatisation
and
liberalisation
.
But
privatisation
does
not
even
come
into
question
in
this
context
,
it
is
not
being
proposed
.
It
is
up
to
the
railway
undertakings
to
decide
whether
to
do
so
more
in
the
form
of
cooperation
or
of
competition
.
I
believe
the
Commission
has
done
a
very
good
job
in
many
cases
.
Each
country
should
continue
to
be
able
to
regulate
this
as
it
wishes
in
its
area
of
jurisdiction
.
Personally
,
I
should
like
to
see
a
number
of
other
requirements
deleted
.
Consequently
,
the
proposals
could
,
in
practice
,
produce
the
opposite
effect
to
that
intended
and
become
an
obstacle
to
increased
competition
.
Many
countries
and
regions
are
worried
,
and
perhaps
with
reason
.
But
the
opportunity
for
the
renaissance
of
the
railways
is
at
hand
,
and
that
is
what
we
should
strive
for
.
Compared
with
my
own
objectives
,
I
do
not
think
the
demands
made
by
either
of
them
are
tough
enough
.
Mr
President
,
here
too
I
must
congratulate
the
two
rapporteurs
.
But
there
are
a
few
facts
that
we
must
face
.
I
do
not
agree
with
him
at
all
.
How
can
we
license
individual
operators
if
we
do
not
make
that
separation
?
Why
do
we
say
that
?
Firstly
,
the
amendment
of
the
concept
of
authorised
applicants
which
allows
any
natural
or
legal
person
to
request
infrastructure
capacity
.
We
all
know
that
the
market
share
of
the
railways
has
declined
in
recent
years
.
My
group
welcomes
that
opportunity
and
supports
the
Commission
and
our
rapporteurs
in
their
efforts
to
secure
a
future
for
Europe
's
railways
.
Both
the
reports
before
us
today
represent
further
necessary
steps
along
the
same
road
.
If
rail
is
to
have
real
vitality
,
then
rail
is
going
to
have
to
change
.
It
results
in
a
less
clear
definition
and
is
,
in
our
view
,
an
unnecessary
change
.
I
have
great
sympathy
with
the
view
that
Community
legislation
should
not
be
over-prescriptive
.
There
are
a
number
of
key
points
that
I
would
like
to
address
before
concluding
.
It
will
encourage
them
to
place
greater
reliance
on
this
mode
of
transport
.
They
have
to
make
a
stronger
commitment
to
rail
.
I
conclude
by
thanking
both
rapporteurs
,
I
hope
that
the
whole
House
will
endorse
their
constructive
approach
.
So
there
is
no
question
of
closing
down
,
there
is
a
question
of
the
practical
discretion
of
the
committee
.
We
will
meet
that
commitment
.
The
vote
will
take
place
tomorrow
at
12
noon
.
Perhaps
it
is
especially
important
,
however
,
to
define
in
precise
terms
the
responsibility
that
city
will
have
to
assume
.
A
bird
cried
out
on
the
roof
,
and
he
woke
up
.
It
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
,
in
the
heat
,
in
Africa
;
he
knew
at
once
where
he
was
.
The
road
to
the
village
would
be
blocked
,
the
dog
ran
over
the
soft
fields
breathing
like
a
dragon
...
the
kernel
of
the
house
was
warm
with
oil-fired
heating
and
the
light
from
red
shades
,
the
silky
colours
of
Olivia
's
things
...
the
rugs
,
cherry-
and
satin-wood
pieces
...
and
the
red
earth
pots
,
bits
of
beadwork
,
the
two
fine
carvings
they
once
found
in
the
Congo
.
A
few
days
ago
he
was
in
that
house
,
packing
to
leave
in
the
flat
progression
of
practical
matters
by
which
decision
is
broken
up
into
reality
.
If
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
boiler
,
for
heaven
's
sake
let
Mackie
look
at
it
before
you
send
to
town
.
What
a
pity
you
gave
away
your
shorts
.
There
's
no
knowing
if
I
'll
be
anywhere
where
I
could
dare
appear
in
shorts
,
any
more
.
But
your
waist
measurement
has
n't
changed
by
so
much
as
half
an
inch
...
I
know
by
your
pyjama
trousers
,
I
use
exactly
the
same
measurement
for
new
elastic
as
I
always
did
.
Three
months
before
,
Adamson
Mweta
stood
outside
a
steak
house
in
Kensington
and
said
to
him
,
Of
course
you
'll
come
back
to
us
now
!
He
had
driven
home
,
slowing
down
on
the
empty
road
that
led
through
the
fullness
of
a
deserted
summer
twilight
,
at
last
,
to
the
house
.
Housing
estates
overrun
villages
all
over
England
,
but
here
the
process
had
been
reversed
;
the
house
had
once
been
a
manor
(
Olivia
thought
that
,
even
earlier
,
it
had
been
a
priory
)
but
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
village
was
depopulated
by
the
drift
to
industrialized
towns
,
lost
its
autonomy
,
and
died
;
the
shop-cum-post-office
had
closed
,
the
cottages
had
fallen
down
;
As
Olivia
said
,
it
ought
to
have
been
a
sad-feeling
place
but
it
was
n't
;
there
was
instead
a
renewal
:
the
country
had
come
back
,
bringing
the
reassurance
of
stubborn
peace
and
fecundity
,
a
beginning
again
.
And
they
were
only
two-hours-and-a-bit
from
London
,
their
daughters
and
their
friends
.
He
had
kept
up
,
since
he
finally
left
Africa
ten
years
ago
,
a
close
contact
with
Adamson
Mweta
and
the
other
leaders
of
the
African
independence
movement
.
He
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
going
back
and
forth
to
London
to
advise
them
when
they
conferred
with
the
Colonial
Office
,
and
to
do
what
he
could
to
smooth
the
way
for
various
delegations
that
came
to
petition
against
the
old
constitution
and
to
negotiate
independence
for
their
country
.
It
was
there
,
in
this
Central
African
territory
,
that
he
had
been
a
colonial
servant
until
the
settlers
succeeded
in
having
him
recalled
and
deported
for
his
support
of
the
People
's
Independence
Party
.
He
said
to
his
wife
,
Mweta
's
invited
me
to
come
back
as
their
guest
.
Well
,
you
ought
to
be
at
the
Independence
celebrations
,
if
anyone
is
.
That
's
marvellous
.
She
used
to
make
packages
of
sandwiches
for
Mweta
to
take
with
him
when
he
cycled
for
miles
about
Gala
province
at
weekends
,
speaking
at
meetings
.
He
said
to
Adamson
Mweta
before
they
parted
the
next
day
,
Olivia
wo
n't
be
able
to
come
out
to
Independence
,
unfortunately
...
our
elder
daughter
's
expecting
a
child
just
round
about
that
time
.
Mweta
said
,
with
his
slow
shy
smile
that
always
seemed
to
grow
like
a
light
becoming
more
powerful
,
as
his
eyes
held
you
,
You
mean
little
Venetia
?
She
going
to
be
a
mother
?
I
'm
afraid
so
,
he
mumbled
in
his
Englishman
's
way
.
Well
,
that
's
good
,
that
's
good
.
Never
mind
,
Mrs.
Bray
will
join
you
later
.
I
imagine
by
the
time
she
's
prepared
to
trust
the
baby
to
Venetia
the
celebrations
'll
be
over
.
That
's
what
I
mean
–
you
'll
be
more
or
less
settled
by
the
time
she
arrives
.
They
were
standing
at
the
door
of
Mweta
's
taxi
;
there
was
a
sudden
uprush
of
feeling
between
the
two
men
;
the
Englishman
stood
there
,
the
small
,
quick
black
man
took
him
by
the
biceps
,
hard
,
through
his
dark
suit
,
as
in
his
own
country
he
would
have
linked
fingers
with
a
brother
.
Under
the
release
of
physical
contact
,
he
said
to
Mweta
,
I
do
n't
know
what
we
're
talking
about
,
and
Mweta
said
,
You
...
I
told
you
we
expect
you
back
,
now
.
But
what
would
I
do
?
What
use
should
I
be
to
you
?
He
was
so
accustomed
to
effacing
himself
in
the
hours
of
discussion
of
constitutional
law
and
political
tactics
(
a
white
man
,
an
outsider
offering
impersonal
service
for
whatever
it
was
worth
)
...
a
strong
consciousness
of
his
own
being
flooded
him
as
if
a
stimulant
had
been
injected
into
his
veins
.
Whatever
you
like
!
It
's
all
ours
!
We
need
you
;
whatever
you
like
!
Mweta
broke
away
and
jumped
into
the
taxi
.
The
pale
stone
façade
with
its
stone
lintels
and
sills
worn
smooth
as
a
piece
of
used
soap
was
directly
on
the
empty
road
but
the
real
face
of
the
house
was
the
other
side
.
Sheltered
by
the
building
the
garden
was
a
grassy
look-out
over
fuzzy
colours
of
flowers
,
bees
,
and
early
moths
to
the
long
valley
.
He
and
Olivia
gardened
on
summer
evenings
,
not
seriously
,
as
she
did
during
the
day
,
but
desultorily
pulling
out
a
tall
rank
weed
here
or
there
,
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
its
roots
yield
from
the
humus
and
bring
up
,
in
the
crumbs
clinging
to
that
beard
grown
underground
,
a
smell
of
earth
rich
as
fruit-cake
.
They
had
laid
flag-stones
under
the
walnut
trees
for
the
white
wooden
chairs
and
table
,
so
that
it
would
n't
be
too
damp
.
They
drank
whisky
there
,
or
even
the
coffee
after
dinner
.
Sometimes
before
the
dusk
wavered
the
wood
away
into
the
distance
,
he
went
out
into
the
sunlight
that
collected
like
golden
water
in
the
dip
of
the
meadows
and
shot
a
partridge
.
There
was
no
one
to
bother
about
shooting
rights
.
Afterwards
as
the
evening
faded
he
cleaned
the
gun
almost
by
feel
and
the
clean
,
practical
smell
of
gun-oil
conveyed
the
simple
satisfaction
of
the
task
.
Olivia
played
records
with
the
living-room
windows
wide
open
so
that
the
music
came
out
to
them
.
This
summer
it
was
Stravinsky
and
Poulenc
;
she
was
of
the
generation
and
class
that
paid
other
women
to
knit
and
now
that
she
herself
was
about
to
be
a
grandmother
she
made
funny
stuffed
toys
for
nieces
and
nephews
.
She
had
a
cigar
box
full
of
odd
buttons
,
as
a
supply
of
eyes
,
but
she
put
it
away
from
her
because
one
of
the
things
she
had
hated
when
she
was
young
was
the
show
of
dissembling
older
women
made
when
confronted
with
something
vital
to
them
.
I
suppose
we
said
many
times
we
'd
come
back
when
they
got
their
independence
.
She
gave
a
small
,
self-questioning
shrug
,
admitting
the
glibness
of
another
kind
of
daily
talk
in
another
time
.
It
's
not
because
of
what
one
said
.
But
both
knew
that
,
in
those
days
,
the
important
thing
was
to
give
Adamson
Mweta
faith
in
himself
by
positing
a
future
that
was
real
because
you
,
a
white
person
with
nothing
personal
to
gain
by
it
,
showed
you
believed
it
would
come
about
.
Gazing
out
across
the
valley
and
then
calmly
at
him
,
she
had
her
look
of
wanting
to
find
out
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
.
He
said
,
Certainly
I
thought
of
going
back
,
then
.
Before
we
left
.
Just
as
I
knew
we
should
have
to
leave
.
Poor
Adamson
,
it
looked
pretty
hopeless
at
times
.
And
yet
it
's
come
so
quickly
.
Ten
years
.
Ten
years
since
they
had
been
deported
from
the
territory
,
ten
years
since
she
was
a
youngish
woman
of
forty
,
and
the
girls
were
still
schoolgirls
.
Historically
,
yes
,
it
would
happen
but
not
to
Adamson
,
and
not
to
us
?
The
house
they
had
bought
,
filled
with
possessions
that
had
been
stored
all
the
years
they
were
in
Africa
,
the
garden
they
had
made
,
spoke
for
them
.
It
was
not
a
house
to
be
quitted
.
They
expect
you
back
,
she
said
with
pride
.
Adamson
was
in
the
flush
of
victory
,
all
right
.
I
think
he
'd
have
embraced
Henry
Davis
.
Davis
was
the
settler
M.P.
who
had
been
responsible
,
at
one
stage
,
for
getting
Mweta
banished
to
the
far
Western
Province
.
He
naturally
assumes
you
'll
come
out
of
exile
.
They
laughed
.
But
they
were
talking
of
Mweta
;
the
strange
shyness
of
twenty-two
years
of
marriage
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
say
:
Do
you
want
to
go
?
The
passionate
beginning
,
the
long
openness
and
understanding
between
them
should
have
meant
that
she
would
know
what
he
wanted
.
And
in
a
way
she
did
know
:
because
it
was
for
them
a
code
so
deeply
accepted
that
it
had
never
been
discussed
...
one
was
available
wherever
one
was
of
use
.
What
else
was
there
to
live
by
?
And
so
the
question
of
what
they
were
talking
about
really
amounted
to
her
hidden
,
pressed-down
,
banked-over
desire
to
know
whether
this
house
,
this
life
in
Wiltshire
,
this
life
–
at
last
–
seemed
to
him
the
definitive
one
,
in
the
end
.
Because
she
was
suddenly
realizing
that
it
had
been
so
for
her
.
She
was
,
after
all
(
in
the
true
sense
of
after
all
that
had
gone
before
)
an
Englishwoman
.
She
had
taken
out
of
storage
the
furniture
and
family
possessions
that
had
been
nothing
but
a
nuisance
to
her
when
they
left
England
together
twenty
years
ago
,
and
,
putting
them
in
place
,
inevitably
had
accepted
the
life
the
arrangement
of
such
objects
provided
for
,
and
her
comfortable
private
income
made
possible
.
In
the
room
they
had
decided
upon
for
his
study
,
the
desk
from
her
great-grandfather
that
had
naturally
become
his
–
a
quiet
field
of
black-red
morocco
scratched
with
almost
erased
gold
–
was
a
place
to
write
the
properly
documented
history
of
the
territory
(
Mweta
's
country
)
that
had
never
been
done
before
;
not
the
boxwood
Colonial
Office
desk
at
which
one
dealt
with
government
forms
and
made
the
empirical
scribbles
of
administration
or
politics
.
In
the
scented
,
mothy
evening
she
felt
the
presence
of
the
house
like
someone
standing
behind
her
.
She
did
not
know
whether
he
felt
it
too
;
and
she
could
not
try
to
find
out
because
if
it
turned
out
that
he
did
n't
–
she
had
a
premonition
,
sometimes
,
that
in
middle
age
you
could
find
you
had
lost
everything
in
a
moment
:
husband
–
lover
,
friend
,
children
,
it
was
as
if
they
had
never
happened
,
or
you
had
wandered
off
from
them
without
knowing
,
and
now
stood
stock-still
with
the
discovery
.
They
watched
the
moths
in
the
tobacco
flowers
.
She
said
in
her
sensible
,
inquiring
,
Englishwoman
's
voice
behind
which
generations
of
her
kind
had
sheltered
,
Did
Mweta
say
how
long
?
It
was
very
much
a
gesture
!
No
,
but
he
'd
already
mentioned
it
yesterday
,
is
n't
that
so
?
You
misunderstood
him
yesterday
.
A
year
?
Six
months
?
...
What
?
White
people
given
appointments
in
African
countries
after
independence
were
usually
employed
on
contract
.
Good
Lord
,
I
've
no
idea
,
I
'm
sure
he
has
n't
either
.
It
's
all
in
the
air
.
Olivia
went
in
to
change
the
record
and
because
it
was
,
unexpectedly
,
Mozart
–
the
harp
and
Mute
concerto
–
he
lit
a
cigar
to
smoke
while
he
enjoyed
it
.
She
wandered
down
to
the
herb
garden
and
brought
back
a
branch
of
dill
;
There
he
is
,
she
said
.
It
was
their
owl
,
a
youngster
who
had
hatched
out
down
in
the
field
and
was
heard
every
night
.
She
remarked
that
tomorrow
she
must
pick
the
dill
for
drying
.
Everything
was
just
as
it
was
.
But
everything
was
changed
.
All
had
turned
over
in
the
barrel
of
the
world
and
steadied
itself
again
.
She
knew
,
if
he
did
n't
,
that
he
was
going
.
It
was
night
in
Europe
all
the
way
.
Dark
rain
in
the
afternoon
in
London
when
the
plane
took
off
,
at
Rome
the
airport
a
vast
,
bleary
shopwindow
shining
blurred
colours
through
rain
.
He
hauled
down
his
coat
again
to
get
out
at
Athens
.
The
metal
rail
of
the
steps
wheeled
against
the
plane
was
icy-wet
to
his
palm
and
in
the
streaming
rain
he
did
not
smell
the
Aegean
or
thyme
,
as
he
had
remembered
from
other
journeys
to
Africa
.
Inside
the
airport
under
the
yellow
light
the
passengers
sat
down
again
on
exhausted-looking
chairs
,
bundled
deep
in
their
heavy
clothing
.
An
old
woman
with
crinkly
grey
hair
woke
up
at
her
post
outside
the
lavatory
and
opened
the
door
,
smiling
and
grasping
a
filthy
cleaning
rag
.
He
walked
around
to
ease
the
cramp
in
his
knees
but
there
was
a
small
circumference
and
within
a
few
strides
one
found
oneself
back
again
at
the
shop
,
before
which
women
and
child
passengers
were
drawn
to
gaze
at
embroidered
aprons
and
evzone
dolls
.
A
girl
of
ten
or
eleven
with
the
badges
of
the
cantons
of
Switzerland
sewn
to
the
sleeve
of
her
coat
had
exactly
the
look
of
Venetia
at
that
age
.
He
bought
a
postcard
of
brilliant
blue
sea
and
dazzling
white
ruins
and
tried
to
write
,
in
what
he
could
remember
of
Greek
:
Winter
and
darkness
here
but
in
Cambridge
,
perhaps
,
there
's
already
spring
yelling
its
head
off
?
My
love
to
you
,
James
.
Venetia
had
had
a
first
in
Greek
,
herself
,
only
a
year
ago
,
and
could
laugh
over
the
mistakes
.
But
that
was
the
end
of
Europe
.
At
Kano
a
huge
moon
shone
and
in
a
light
brighter
than
a
European
winter
afternoon
the
passengers
made
their
way
across
the
tarmac
at
three
in
the
morning
against
the
resistance
of
a
heat
of
the
day
persisting
all
through
the
night
as
the
sun
persists
in
a
stone
it
has
warmed
.
There
was
a
smell
of
woodsmoke
;
the
men
moving
about
beneath
the
belly
of
the
plane
had
bare
black
feet
.
When
the
passengers
climbed
aboard
again
,
their
clothes
felt
hairy
and
the
plane
was
airless
.
He
put
the
coat
away
on
the
rack
,
apologizing
,
trying
not
to
hamper
other
people
in
the
general
move
to
rearrange
gear
;
the
anticipation
of
arrival
,
still
some
hours
off
,
aroused
in
them
not
so
much
common
purpose
as
a
spread
of
instinct
as
in
the
lifted
heads
of
a
herd
become
aware
of
the
promise
of
water
.
When
the
sun
rose
some
slumped
off
into
sleep
,
but
women
began
to
examine
the
plastic
bags
in
which
they
kept
their
hats
,
and
,
as
the
hard
beams
of
the
sun
struck
into
the
cabin
on
hairnets
,
pale
lips
,
and
stubble
,
queues
formed
for
the
lavatories
.
While
he
was
writing
on
the
customs
and
immigration
form
,
BRAY
,
Evelyn
James
,
and
the
number
of
his
passport
,
someone
was
reading
his
name
over
his
shoulder
;
he
flexed
it
awkwardly
,
not
because
he
minded
,
but
in
mild
embarrassment
.
The
queue
for
the
lavatory
moved
along
a
notch
,
he
glanced
up
and
the
man
,
carrying
a
flowered
sponge-bag
,
caught
his
eye
with
a
tired
vacant
stare
that
changed
to
an
expression
of
greeting
.
The
woman
who
had
dozed
beside
him
all
night
communicating
the
intimate
rhythm
of
her
breathing
but
never
exchanging
a
word
,
suddenly
began
to
talk
like
a
bird
who
has
the
cover
taken
off
its
cage
.
He
wedged
himself
between
the
seats
to
recover
the
shoe
she
had
lost
somewhere
over
a
distant
desert
;
she
laughed
,
protested
apologetically
,
and
shook
cologne
down
into
her
freckled
bosom
.
Dragging
back
the
little
curtain
from
the
oval
window
,
she
looked
into
the
dazzling
glare
of
space
and
said
,
Glorious
morning
up
here
!
and
they
discussed
with
animation
the
cold
and
sudden
winter
that
was
left
behind
.
As
he
did
not
have
a
window
seat
he
did
not
see
the
bush
and
the
earth
red
as
brick-dust
and
the
furze
of
growth
along
the
river-beds
:
not
until
the
plane
had
come
to
a
stop
on
the
runway
,
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
health
inspector
to
come
aboard
.
He
unhooked
his
safety
belt
and
leaned
over
to
look
at
an
angle
through
the
bleary
lens
on
the
far
side
of
the
aisle
;
and
there
it
was
,
tiny
and
distorted
and
real
,
bush
,
earth
,
exactly
as
it
remained
in
his
mind
always
,
without
his
thinking
about
it
.
It
was
underfoot
.
It
was
around
.
A
black
man
in
khaki
shorts
(
used
to
be
a
white
man
in
white
stockings
)
sprayed
a
cloyingly
perfumed
insecticide
over
the
passengers
'
heads
as
a
precaution
against
the
plane
harbouring
mosquitoes
and
tsetse
flies
.
The
doors
opened
;
voices
from
without
came
in
on
currents
of
air
;
he
emerged
among
the
others
into
heady
recognition
taken
in
at
all
the
senses
,
walking
steadily
across
the
tarmac
through
the
raw-potato
whiff
of
the
undergrowth
,
the
fresh
,
early
warmth
on
hands
,
the
cool
metallic
taste
of
last
night
's
storm
at
the
back
of
the
throat
,
The
disembarking
passengers
were
all
strangers
again
,
connected
not
with
each
other
but
to
the
mouthing
,
smiling
faces
and
waving
hands
on
the
airport
balcony
.
He
knew
no
one
but
the
walk
was
processional
,
a
reception
to
him
,
and
by
the
time
he
entered
the
building
over
the
steps
where
,
as
always
,
dead
insects
fallen
from
the
light
during
the
night
had
not
been
swept
away
,
it
was
all
as
suddenly
familiar
and
ordinary
as
the
faces
other
people
were
greeting
were
,
to
them
.
Waiting
to
be
summoned
to
the
customs
officers
'
booths
,
the
companions
of
the
journey
ignored
each
other
.
Only
the
man
with
the
flowered
sponge-bag
,
as
if
unaware
of
this
useful
convention
,
insisted
on
a
Here
we
are
again
smile
.
You
're
Colonel
Bray
?
He
spoke
round
the
obstacle
of
a
woman
standing
between
them
.
Thought
I
recognized
you
in
Rome
.
Welcome
back
.
I
must
confess
I
do
n't
remember
you
.
I
've
been
away
a
long
time
.
The
man
had
long
coarse
strands
of
sun-yellowed
hair
spread
from
ear
to
ear
across
a
bald
head
and
wore
sunglasses
that
rested
on
fine
Nordic
cheekbones
.
I
've
only
just
come
to
live
here
...
from
down
South
.
South
Africa
.
Who
was
that
I
do
n't
know
...
one
of
the
people
from
the
plane
...
a
baldish
fair
man
with
an
accent
,
I
did
n't
catch
the
name
.
He
'd
recently
moved
up
here
.
Oh
Hjalmar
Wentz
must
have
been
.
He
and
his
wife
took
over
the
Silver
Rhino
last
year
.
I
like
old
Hjalmar
.
He
's
just
been
to
Denmark
or
somewhere
because
his
mother
died
.
We
'll
go
in
and
have
a
steak
there
one
evening
,
they
're
trying
to
make
a
go
of
it
with
a
charcoal
grill
and
whatnot
.
What
happened
to
McGowan
?
Good
God
,
they
've
been
gone
at
least
five
or
six
years
.
There
've
been
three
other
managers
since
then
.
It
's
difficult
to
do
anything
with
that
place
now
;
it
's
got
the
character
of
the
miners
'
pub
it
was
,
but
it
's
very
handy
for
the
new
government
offices
,
not
too
overawing
,
so
you
get
quite
a
few
Africans
coming
in
.
A
genteel
lot
,
very
conscious
of
their
dignity
,
man-about-town
and
all
that
,
you
can
imagine
how
the
white
toughies
feel
about
all
those
white
collars
round
black
necks
in
the
bar
.
Hjalmar
's
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
he
has
to
keep
the
peace
somehow
.
Oh
I
'll
tell
you
who
's
still
around
though
–
Barry
Forsyth
.
Yes
,
and
making
money
.
Forsyth
Construction
.
You
'll
see
the
board
everywhere
.
They
tell
me
he
's
got
the
contract
for
the
whole
Isoza
River
reclamation
scheme
...
employs
engineers
from
Poland
and
Italy
Because
of
the
mosquitoes
,
they
moved
into
the
house
.
The
spiders
came
out
from
behind
the
pictures
and
flattened
like
starfish
against
the
walls
.
There
was
no
air
at
all
in
the
living-room
,
and
a
strong
smell
of
hot
fat
.
Every
now
and
then
,
while
dinner
was
awaited
,
their
conversation
was
backed
by
intensely
sociable
sounds
–
pitched
talk
–
let
in
from
the
kitchen
as
the
servant
went
in
and
out
,
laying
the
table
.
There
was
another
large
meal
,
and
an
exchange
about
a
bottle
of
white
wine
between
Dando
and
his
cook
,
Festus
.
Of
course
I
do
n't
open
wrong
kind
bottle
.
I
know
when
is
eat-e
chicken
,
I
know
when
is
eat-e
beef
.
Well
it
is
the
wrong
one
,
because
I
told
you
this
morning
I
wanted
the
round
flat
bottle
put
in
the
fridge
.
You
say
I
cook
chicken
,
is
n't
it
?
I
look
,
I
see
the
round
bottle
is
red
wine
inside
...
It
's
pink
.
I
specially
did
n't
say
anything
about
the
colour
because
I
did
n't
want
to
muddle
you
up
.
I
know
how
obstinate
you
are
,
Festus
...
They
argued
self-righteously
as
two
old-maid
sisters
.
Festus
could
be
heard
retailing
the
exchange
,
confidently
in
the
right
,
in
the
kitchen
;
Dando
,
equally
assured
,
went
on
talking
as
if
without
interruption
.
It
's
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
what
they
're
having
to
do
is
introduce
a
so-called
democratic
social
system
in
place
of
a
paternalist
discipline
.
You
have
n't
replaced
the
District
Commissioner
by
appointing
a
district
magistrate
.
You
've
only
replaced
one
of
his
functions
.
You
've
still
got
to
get
country
people
to
realize
that
these
functions
are
now
distributed
among
various
agencies
:
it
's
no
good
running
to
the
magistrate
if
someone
needs
an
ambulance
to
take
him
to
the
next
town
,
for
instance
...
In
bush
stations
there
was
n't
anything
we
were
n't
responsible
for
.
Exactly
.
But
now
people
have
to
learn
that
there
's
a
Department
of
Public
Health
to
go
to
.
A
good
thing
!
A
good
thing
for
everybody
!
What
a
hopeless
business
it
was
,
hopeless
for
the
D.C.
and
for
the
people
.
Dependency
and
resentment
hand
in
hand
.
Whatever
the
black
magistrates
are
like
,
whatever
the
administration
's
like
,
it
wo
n't
be
like
that
.
The
magistrates
are
all
right
,
do
n't
you
worry
.
A
damned
sight
better
than
some
of
our
fellows
.
I
'm
not
worried
at
that
level
.
The
Bench
does
n't
change
of
course
.
Bray
laughed
at
Dando
's
expression
;
the
look
of
weary
,
bottomless
distaste
in
the
wrinkled
mugs
of
certain
breeds
of
dogs
.
They
'll
die
off
,
I
suppose
.
There
's
that
to
be
said
for
it
.
But
God
knows
what
we
'll
get
then
.
I
met
Gwenzi
's
brother
in
London
one
day
while
he
was
at
Gray
's
Inn
;
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
be
the
first
African
at
the
bar
here
.
When
Dando
's
opinion
of
someone
was
really
low
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
his
name
.
Do
n't
think
I
do
n't
know
I
've
got
some
bad
times
coming
to
me
,
he
said
,
as
if
taking
up
,
in
private
,
current
talk
about
himself
.
When
I
said
yes
to
Mweta
I
knew
it
and
every
time
I
walk
past
the
title
on
my
office
door
I
know
it
.
The
day
will
come
when
I
'll
have
deportation
orders
to
sign
that
I
wo
n't
want
to
sign
.
Warrants
of
arrest
.
Or
worse
.
He
ate
a
mouthful
of
the
left-over
granadilla
pudding
,
and
there
was
the
smallest
tremor
,
passing
for
a
moment
through
his
head
.
Poor
old
Dando
.
Anyone
who
's
stayed
on
is
a
fool
if
he
has
n't
thought
about
that
,
said
Bray
.
And
I
'll
be
instructing
the
State
Prosecutor
to
act
when
I
'd
rather
not
,
too
.
That
I
can
count
on
.
What
if
Shinza
should
make
a
bit
of
trouble
at
the
next
elections
,
what
if
he
were
to
feel
himself
bloody
well
discounted
as
he
certainly
is
,
and
start
up
a
real
opposition
with
all
the
tricks
that
he
taught
PIP
,
eh
?
What
if
he
brought
the
whole
Lambala-speaking
crowd
out
in
a
boycott
,
with
all
the
old
beatingsup
at
the
polls
,
hut
burnings
–
you
think
I
would
n't
find
myself
the
one
to
put
Shinza
inside
,
this
time
?
Well
,
I
know
.
But
why
on
earth
should
it
come
to
that
?
I
knew
it
when
I
said
yes
to
Mweta
.
Poor
bloody
Dando
.
The
blacks
'
dirty
work
is
n't
any
cleaner
than
the
whites
'
.
That
's
what
they
'll
be
happy
to
note
.
But
what
their
contented
little
minds
will
never
know
is
that
I
knew
it
when
I
took
the
job
,
I
knew
it
all
along
,
and
I
'll
say
it
now
as
loud
as
I
'd
say
it
then
...
Who
'll
be
happy
?
Dando
refilled
the
brandy
glasses
again
.
My
colleagues
!
Those
worthy
fellows
who
've
gone
down
South
to
Rhodesia
and
South
Africa
where
they
can
feel
confident
they
'll
never
have
a
black
man
on
the
Bench
to
give
a
verdict
as
biased
as
a
white
man
's
.
It
was
after
midnight
when
they
got
to
bed
.
Bray
went
to
the
kitchen
to
fill
his
brandy
glass
with
water
for
the
night
.
Cockroaches
fled
,
pausing
,
from
what
they
regarded
as
positions
of
safety
,
to
twirl
their
antennae
.
A
furry
black
band
of
ants
led
up
a
cupboard
door
to
some
scrap
that
had
flicked
from
a
plate
.
He
stood
at
the
sink
,
drinking
cold
water
and
looking
at
the
avocado
pear
pip
growing
suspended
by
three
matchsticks
in
the
neck
of
a
pickle
jar
of
water
on
the
sill
.
He
was
conscious
of
a
giddy
swing
of
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
that
was
not
of
his
volition
;
it
seemed
he
had
been
standing
there
a
long
time
–
he
was
not
sure
.
He
heard
Dando
,
forced
by
the
old
Labrador
into
the
garden
,
walking
about
outside
the
guest
hut
and
talking
reproachfully
to
the
dog
;
and
then
it
was
morning
and
Festus
's
assistant
was
at
the
door
with
the
early
tea
.
A
helicopter
snored
over
the
celebrations
,
drowning
the
exchange
of
greetings
when
Bray
was
introduced
to
someone
in
the
street
,
expunging
conversation
in
bars
and
even
speeches
.
Nobody
knew
what
it
was
for
...
a
security
measure
,
some
were
satisfied
to
assume
,
while
others
accepted
it
as
vaguely
appropriate
,
the
symbol
of
progress
inseparable
from
all
industrial
fairs
and
agricultural
shows
and
therefore
somehow
relevant
to
any
public
display
.
There
was
a
moment
in
the
stadium
at
the
actual
Independence
ceremony
when
he
heard
it
on
the
perimeter
of
the
sky
just
as
Kenyatta
began
to
speak
,
and
he
and
Vivien
Bayley
,
the
young
wife
of
the
registrar
of
the
new
university
,
sitting
beside
him
,
collided
glances
of
alert
apprehension
...
Later
it
was
discovered
to
have
been
giving
flips
at
half-a-crown
a
time
to
a
section
of
the
population
who
were
queueing
up
,
all
through
the
ceremony
,
at
the
nearby
soccer
field
;
a
publicity
stunt
for
an
international
cigarette-making
firm
.
Neil
Bayley
was
the
one
to
find
this
out
,
because
of
some
domestic
mishap
or
misunderstanding
that
made
his
arrival
at
the
visitors
'
stand
very
late
.
Bray
was
conscious
of
furious
tension
between
the
young
couple
at
his
side
as
he
sat
with
the
great
stir
of
tiers
of
people
behind
,
and
the
space
in
front
of
him
,
before
the
velvet-draped
and
canopied
dais
,
filled
with
press
photographers
and
radio
and
television
crews
,
who
all
through
the
solemnities
raced
about
bent
double
on
frantic
tiptoe
,
snaking
their
wires
,
thrusting
up
their
contraptions
manipulating
shutters
and
flashlights
.
It
was
as
if
with
all
made
splendidly
ready
for
a
theatrical
performance
,
a
party
of
workmen
with
their
gear
had
been
left
behind
.
This
activity
and
the
risen
temper
along
the
back
of
a
silent
quarrel
beside
him
provided
the
strong
distraction
of
another
,
disorderly
level
of
being
that
always
seemed
to
him
to
take
away
from
planned
great
moments
what
they
were
meant
to
hold
heady
and
pure
.
Here
was
the
symbolic
attainment
of
something
he
had
believed
in
,
willed
and
worked
for
,
for
a
good
stretch
of
his
life
:
expressed
in
the
roar
that
rocked
back
and
forth
from
the
crowd
at
intervals
,
the
togas
,
medalled
breasts
and
white
gloves
,
the
ululating
cries
of
women
,
the
soldiers
at
attention
,
and
the
sun
striking
off
the
clashing
brass
of
the
bands
.
Or
in
the
icecream
tricycles
waiting
at
the
base
of
each
section
of
an
amphitheatre
of
dark
faces
,
the
mongrel
that
ran
out
and
lifted
its
leg
on
the
presidential
dais
?
Mweta
had
the
mummified
look
of
one
who
has
become
a
vessel
of
ritual
.
But
once
the
declaration
of
independence
was
pronounced
he
came
,
as
out
of
a
trance
,
to
an
irresistibly
lively
self
,
sitting
up
there
seeing
everything
around
him
,
a
spectator
,
Bray
felt
,
as
well
as
a
spectacle
.
Bray
was
half-embarrassed
to
find
that
he
even
caught
his
eye
,
once
,
and
there
was
a
quick
smile
;
but
Mweta
was
used
to
having
eyes
on
him
,
by
now
.
He
talked
to
the
elderly
English
princess
who
sat
beside
him
with
her
knees
peaked
neatly
together
in
the
Royal
position
curiously
expressive
of
the
suffering
of
ceremonies
,
and
Bray
saw
him
point
out
the
contingent
of
Gala
women
,
their
faces
and
breasts
whitened
for
joy
,
who
were
lined
up
among
the
troops
of
musicians
and
dancers
from
various
regions
.
And
yet
when
that
ceremony
was
over
,
and
in
between
all
the
other
official
occasions
–
State
Ball
,
receptions
,
cocktail
parties
,
banquets
,
and
luncheons
–
a
mood
of
celebration
grew
up
,
as
it
were
,
outside
the
palace
gates
.
He
attended
most
of
the
official
occasions
(
he
and
Roly
saluted
each
other
with
mock
surprise
when
they
met
in
the
house
,
half-dressed
in
formal
dinner
clothes
every
night
)
but
the
real
parties
took
place
before
and
after
.
These
grew
spontaneously
one
out
of
the
other
,
and
once
you
had
been
present
at
the
first
,
you
got
handed
on
to
all
the
others
.
He
really
knew
only
some
of
the
people
but
all
of
them
seemed
to
know
about
him
,
and
many
were
the
friends
of
friends
.
Dando
took
him
to
the
Bayleys
;
but
Neil
was
a
friend
of
Mweta
,
and
Vivien
was
the
niece
of
,
of
all
people
,
Sir
William
Clough
,
the
last
governor
,
who
had
been
a
junior
with
Bray
in
the
colonial
service
in
Tanganyika
.
The
Bayleys
were
friends
of
Cyprian
Kente
,
Mweta
's
Minister
of
the
Interior
,
and
his
wife
Tindi
,
and
Timothy
Odara
,
one
of
the
territory
's
few
African
doctors
,
whom
Bray
,
of
course
,
knew
well
.
Through
each
individual
the
group
extended
to
someone
else
and
drew
in
,
out
of
the
new
international
character
of
the
little
capital
,
Poles
,
Ghanaians
,
Hungarians
and
Israelis
,
South
African
and
Rhodesian
refugees
.
After
the
State
Ball
there
was
a
private
all-night
party
in
a
marquee
.
Roly
Dando
had
promised
to
drop
by
,
and
of
course
Bray
was
with
him
.
Cheers
went
up
from
the
people
already
present
who
had
not
been
at
the
ball
;
they
had
decided
to
dress
for
once
,
too
,
and
the
two
groups
of
women
mingled
and
exclaimed
over
each
other
,
everyone
began
to
talk
about
what
the
ball
was
like
,
champagne
came
in
,
a
Congolese
band
whipped
up
their
pace
,
and
the
absurd
and
slightly
thrilling
mood
of
the
State
Ball
and
the
cosy
gaiety
of
the
party
swept
together
.
The
tent
was
filled
with
chairs
and
divans
borrowed
from
people
's
houses
,
and
flowers
from
their
gardens
.
Someone
had
put
up
a
board
with
a
collage
of
blown-up
pictures
of
Mweta
–
speaking
,
laughing
,
yawning
,
touching
a
piece
of
machinery
with
curiosity
,
leaving
,
arriving
,
even
threatening
.
Many
other
people
Bray
had
seen
at
the
ball
streamed
in
in
their
finery
:
they
had
contributed
to
the
arrangements
for
this
party
.
The
trouble
everyone
had
taken
gave
a
sense
of
occasion
to
even
the
wildest
moments
of
the
night
.
Vivien
Bayley
,
queenly
at
twenty-six
,
with
her
beautiful
,
well-mannered
,
disciplined
face
,
came
to
hover
beside
Bray
between
responsible
permutations
about
the
room
to
make
sure
that
this
young
girl
was
not
being
bothered
too
much
by
the
attentions
of
someone
older
and
rather
drunk
,
or
that
young
man
was
not
being
overlooked
by
the
girls
who
ought
to
be
taking
notice
of
him
.
Bray
surprised
her
by
asking
her
to
dance
,
swaying
stiffly
to
a
rhythm
he
did
n't
know
,
but
nevertheless
keeping
the
beat
,
so
that
they
would
n't
make
fools
of
themselves
among
the
complicated
gyrations
of
the
Africans
.
I
'm
so
glad
you
dance
,
she
said
;
he
was
ashamed
that
he
had
asked
her
only
out
of
politeness
.
Neil
wo
n't
...
I
think
it
's
a
mistake
to
let
oneself
forget
these
things
because
of
vanity
.
Tindi
Kente
is
a
wonderful
dancer
,
wonderful
,
is
n't
she
...
just
like
a
snake
brought
out
by
music
,
and
sometimes
he
'll
try
with
her
.
He
loves
to
flirt
with
her
when
Cyprian
's
not
looking
,
but
get
her
doing
her
marvellous
wriggle
on
the
floor
and
he
just
stands
there
like
Andrew
,
dragging
his
feet
.
Andrew
was
probably
one
of
her
children
;
being
accepted
with
such
immediate
casual
friendliness
by
everyone
was
rather
like
being
forced
to
learn
a
foreign
language
by
finding
oneself
alone
among
people
who
spoke
nothing
else
:
it
was
assumed
that
he
would
pick
up
family
and
other
relationships
merely
by
being
exposed
to
them
.
Someone
called
to
Vivien
and
they
were
drawn
away
from
the
dancers
to
a
crowded
table
.
A
young
woman
leaned
her
elbows
on
it
and
her
white
breasts
pursed
forward
within
the
frame
of
her
arms
.
Have
my
glass
,
she
said
,
as
there
were
no
spare
ones
to
go
round
.
She
went
off
to
dance
,
holding
in
her
stomach
as
she
squeezed
past
and
balanced
her
soft-looking
body
.
The
heat
was
heightened
by
drink
and
animation
and
the
glass
filled
by
the
long
,
narrow
black
hand
of
his
neighbour
was
marked
by
the
fingerprints
of
the
white
woman
who
had
relinquished
it
.
You
do
n't
remember
me
?
Ras
Asahe
,
I
came
to
your
place
in
England
once
.
The
young
man
said
he
was
in
broadcasting
now
,
so-called
assistant
to
the
Director
of
English
Language
Services
.
And
how
's
your
father
?
Good
Lord
,
I
'd
like
to
see
him
again
!
Joseph
Asahe
was
one
of
Edward
Shinza
's
lieutenants
in
the
early
days
of
PIP
.
He
's
old
now
.
It
was
not
the
right
question
to
have
asked
;
what
the
young
man
dismissed
was
any
possible
suggestion
that
he
was
to
be
thought
of
in
connection
with
Shinza
.
His
clothes
,
watch
,
cufflinks
were
those
of
a
man
who
feels
he
must
buy
the
best
for
himself
,
he
had
the
Mussolini-jaw
quite
common
among
the
people
in
the
part
of
the
country
he
came
from
but
those
hands
were
the
lyrical
,
delicately
strong
,
African
ones
that
escaped
the
international
blandness
of
businessmen
's
hands
as
Bray
had
marvelled
to
see
them
escape
the
brutalizing
of
physical
hardship
.
Convicts
broke
stones
with
hands
like
that
,
here
.
They
made
conversation
about
the
radio
and
television
coverage
of
the
celebrations
,
and
from
this
broke
into
talk
that
interested
them
both
:
the
problem
of
communication
in
a
country
with
so
many
different
language
groups
.
I
wonder
how
much
use
could
be
made
of
a
radio
classroom
in
country
schools
,
whether
it
could
n't
help
considerably
to
ease
the
shortage
of
teachers
,
here
,
and
maintain
some
sort
of
standard
where
teachers
are
perhaps
not
very
well
qualified
.
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
somebody
about
it
...
your
man
?
I
'm
not
keen
to
go
straight
to
the
Director-General
...
It
wo
n't
make
much
difference
.
They
laughed
at
him
again
.
Everyone
was
gathering
round
for
servings
from
the
roast
sheep
,
and
the
fair
stocky
man
from
the
airport
signalled
a
greeting
with
a
piece
of
meat
in
his
fingers
.
Wentz
,
Hjalmar
Wentz
,
we
met
on
the
plane
.
Roland
Dando
said
we
probably
should
be
seeing
you
at
the
Rhino
.
They
moved
off
with
their
plates
of
food
,
and
Wentz
said
to
a
woman
settled
in
one
of
the
canvas
chairs
,
Margot
,
here
is
Colonel
Bray
.
No
,
no
,
please
stay
where
you
are
.
In
the
fuss
to
find
somewhere
to
sit
he
saw
the
light
of
the
fire
under
the
spit
running
along
the
shiny
planes
of
the
woman
's
face
as
it
did
on
glasses
and
the
movement
of
knives
and
forks
.
Bright
hair
was
brushed
up
off
a
high
round
forehead
and
behind
the
ears
,
in
a
way
he
associated
with
busy
,
capable
women
.
Try
some
,
Margot
,
it
's
wonderful
...
Are
n't
I
fat
enough
...
But
she
took
a
tidbit
of
crisp
fat
from
her
husband
's
fork
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
this
's
the
first
time
for
a
week
we
've
had
time
to
sit
down
to
eat
.
Margot
's
had
to
be
in
the
kitchen
herself
from
six
in
the
morning
,
and
some
nights
it
's
been
until
ten
.
She
literally
has
n't
sat
down
to
a
meal
...
Oh
,
not
quite
...
I
must
have
had
hundreds
of
cups
of
coffee
.
Yes
,
with
one
hand
while
you
were
busy
stirring
a
pot
with
the
other
.
The
cook
went
to
the
Independence
ceremony
and
we
have
n't
seen
him
since
...
just
for
the
afternoon
,
he
said
,
just
to
see
the
great
men
he
's
seen
in
the
papers
...
well
,
what
can
you
say
?
We
felt
it
was
his
day
,
after
all
.
The
woman
showed
a
wellshaped
smile
in
the
dark
.
Bray
asked
,
How
on
earth
have
you
managed
?
She
gestured
and
laughed
,
but
her
husband
was
eager
to
break
in
,
holding
up
his
hands
over
the
plate
balanced
on
his
knees
.
A
hundred
and
twenty-two
for
dinner
!
That
's
what
it
was
on
Thursday
.
And
yesterday
...
Only
a
hundred
and
nine
,
that
's
all
...
They
laughed
.
Bray
raised
his
beer
mug
of
wine
to
her
.
What
about
my
assistant
cook
?
You
must
n't
forget
I
've
got
help
,
she
said
.
Wentz
put
down
his
glass
beside
his
chair
,
to
do
the
justice
of
full
attention
to
what
he
was
going
to
say
.
Her
assistant
cook
.
I
got
him
from
the
new
labour
exchange
–
I
thought
,
well
,
let
's
try
it
,
so
they
send
him
along
,
five
years
'
experience
,
everything
fine
.
His
wife
was
listening
,
laughing
softly
,
sitting
back
majestically
for
a
moment
.
Five
years
'
experience
,
but
d'
you
know
what
as
?
You
know
the
barbers
under
the
mango
trees
there
just
before
you
get
to
the
second-class
trading
area
?
Our
son
's
comment
was
the
best
,
I
think
.
Well
,
here
's
to
three
crazy
people
,
said
Wentz
,
excitedly
picking
up
his
glass
.
Everyone
knows
you
must
be
crazy
to
come
of
your
own
free
will
to
one
of
these
countries
.
Colonel
Bray
is
n't
going
to
run
a
hotel
.
She
had
a
soft
,
dry
voice
and
her
accent
was
slighter
than
her
husband
's
.
I
'm
not
as
brave
as
you
are
.
Oh
,
how
do
you
know
?
said
Wentz
.
We
did
n't
know
what
we
were
going
to
land
up
doing
,
either
.
She
said
quietly
,
We
certainly
did
n't
think
we
'd
be
the
proprietors
of
the
Silver
Rhino
.
Anyway
,
that
's
another
story
,
said
Wentz
.
Oh
,
did
you
?
he
laughed
.
Well
,
perhaps
I
am
,
then
.
I
should
think
the
bar
of
the
Silver
Rhino
's
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
learn
what
's
really
going
on
.
If
you
want
to
hear
how
much
ugliness
there
is
–
yes
.
Mrs.
Wentz
had
the
tone
of
voice
that
sounds
as
if
the
speaker
is
addressing
noone
but
himself
.
How
people
still
think
with
their
blood
and
enjoy
to
contempt
...
yes
,
the
bar
at
the
Silver
Rhino
.
Our
son
Stephen
is
looking
after
it
tonight
.
It
's
amazing
how
he
deals
with
those
fellows
–
better
than
I
do
,
I
can
tell
you
.
He
keeps
them
in
place
.
We
promised
him
a
liberal
education
when
we
left
South
Africa
,
you
see
.
Mrs.
Wentz
had
put
down
her
food
and
she
sat
back
out
of
the
light
of
the
fire
,
a
big
face
glimmering
in
the
dark
,
caverns
where
the
eyes
were
.
taking
the
A
levels
,
said
Wentz
,
innocently
.
You
're
not
going
to
finish
?
The
white
blur
of
her
hand
moved
in
a
gesture
of
rejection
...
You
have
it
,
Hjalmar
.
It
rained
and
people
felt
chilly
on
the
veranda
and
drifted
indoors
.
There
was
a
group
in
loud
discussion
round
the
empty
fireplace
where
the
beer
bottles
were
stacked
...
banging
on
the
Governor
's
door
with
a
panga
when
the
others
were
still
picannins
with
snotty
noses
...
Now
Dando
had
the
sulky
outraged
attention
of
a
young
patriot
from
the
social
welfare
department
,
the
glittering-eyed
indifference
of
Doris
Manyema
,
one
of
the
country
's
three
or
four
women
graduates
,
and
the
amused
appreciation
of
a
South
African
refugee
whose
yellow-brown
colour
,
small
nose
and
fine
lips
set
him
apart
from
the
blackness
of
the
other
two
.
In
the
light
,
Margot
Wentz
's
head
was
the
figurehead
of
a
ship
above
the
hulk
of
her
body
:
a
double-chinned
,
handsome
dark
blonde
,
the
short
high
nose
coming
from
the
magnificent
forehead
,
water-coloured
eyes
underlined
with
cuts
of
fatigue
deep
into
each
cheek
.
With
an
absent
smile
to
Bray
across
the
room
,
she
took
up
,
for
a
moment
,
an
abandoned
beauty
.
When
he
joined
the
group
,
they
were
listening
to
her
.
We
do
n't
have
to
argue
;
we
can
take
it
that
colonialism
is
indefensible
,
for
us
,
no
?
You
think
so
,
I
think
so
...
right
.
Timothy
Odara
's
eyes
were
closed
;
leaning
against
the
wall
he
kept
his
lips
drawn
back
slightly
,
alert
.
I
'm
sorry
,
forty-eight
years
you
were
under
British
rule
,
digging
their
mines
,
building
roads
for
them
,
making
towns
,
living
in
shanties
and
waiting
on
them
,
cleaning
up
after
them
,
treated
like
dirt
...
now
it
's
all
over
,
you
really
think
there
was
any
way
at
all
you
could
enter
the
modern
world
without
suffering
?
You
think
there
was
someone
else
would
have
given
you
the
alphabet
!
and
electricity
and
killed
off
the
malaria
mosquito
,
just
for
love
?
The
Finns
?
The
Russians
?
Anybody
?
Anyone
who
would
n't
have
wanted
the
last
drop
of
your
sweat
and
pride
in
return
?
These
are
the
facts
.
From
your
point
of
view
,
as
it
luckily
lasted
less
than
two
generations
.
Was
n't
it
worth
it
?
Would
anybody
have
let
you
in
for
nothing
?
Anybody
at
all
?
That
's
what
I
'm
asking
...
Would
n't
you
have
to
pay
the
price
in
suffering
?
Oh
you
make
the
usual
mistake
of
seeing
the
life
of
the
African
people
as
a
blank
...
and
then
the
colonialists
come
along
and
we
come
to
life
–
in
your
compounds
and
back
yards
.
She
was
shaking
her
head
slowly
while
Odara
was
speaking
.
All
I
'm
saying
,
do
n't
wear
the
sufferings
of
the
past
round
your
necks
.
What
does
independence
mean
–
I
do
n't
use
freedom
,
I
do
n't
like
the
big
words
–
what
does
your
independence
mean
,
then
?
The
past
is
useful
for
political
purposes
only
said
Hjalmar
,
as
he
might
have
said
:
she
's
right
.
Someone
said
,
Watch
out
for
the
man
from
the
CIA
.
Down
with
neo-colonialism
.
Of
course
,
Curtis
,
said
Hjalmar
.
But
if
you
have
to
do
it
by
keeping
that
forty
years
or
whatever
sitting
at
the
table
with
you
and
your
children
...
ach
,
it
's
not
healthy
,
it
makes
me
sick
.
What
do
they
want
to
hear
how
you
had
to
go
round
to
the
back
door
of
the
missionary
's
house
?
Mrs.
Odara
had
joined
the
group
,
running
a
big
,
silver-nailed
hand
through
Curtis
Pettigrew
's
crew-cut
hair
.
Oh
God
,
Timothy
,
not
that
again
.
Odara
laughed
.
But
it
always
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
:
you
Europeans
talk
very
reasonably
about
that
sort
of
suffering
because
you
do
n't
know
...
you
may
have
thought
it
was
terrible
,
but
there
's
nothing
like
that
in
your
lives
.
Bray
saw
Margot
Wentz
put
up
her
head
with
a
quick
grimace-smile
,
as
if
someone
had
told
an
old
joke
she
could
n't
raise
a
laugh
for
.
Well
,
here
you
're
mistaken
,
her
husband
said
,
rather
grandly
,
we
lived
under
Mr.
Hitler
.
And
you
must
know
all
about
that
.
I
'm
not
interested
in
Hitler
.
Timothy
Odara
's
fine
teeth
were
bared
in
impatient
pleasantness
.
My
friend
,
white
men
have
killed
more
people
in
Africa
than
Hitler
ever
did
in
Europe
.
But
you
're
crazy
,
said
Wentz
gently
.
Europe
's
wars
,
white
men
's
killings
among
themselves
.
What
's
that
to
me
?
You
've
just
said
one
should
n't
burden
oneself
with
suffering
.
I
do
n't
have
any
feelings
about
Hitler
.
Oh
but
you
should
,
Mrs.
Wentz
said
,
almost
dreaming
.
No
more
and
no
less
than
you
do
about
what
happened
to
Africans
.
It
's
all
the
same
thing
.
A
slave
in
the
hold
of
a
ship
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
a
Jew
or
a
gipsy
in
a
concentration
camp
in
the
nineteen-forties
.
Well
,
I
had
my
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
birthdays
in
the
detention
camp
at
Fort
Howard
,
the
guest
of
Her
Majesty
's
governor
,
said
Odara
,
that
I
know
.
Her
two
brothers
died
at
Auschwitz
,
Hjalmar
Wentz
said
;
but
his
wife
was
talking
to
Jo-Ann
Pettigrew
,
who
offered
blobs
of
toasted
marshmallow
on
the
end
of
a
long
fork
.
For
God
's
sake
,
Timothy
,
stop
baring
your
teeth
and
sink
them
into
something
.
Evelyn
Odara
spoke
to
her
husband
as
no
local
woman
would
dare
;
yet
he
ignored
it
,
as
if
turning
the
tables
on
her
with
his
countrymen
's
assumption
that
what
women
said
was
not
heard
,
anyway
.
He
said
angrily
to
Wentz
,
directing
the
remark
at
the
wife
through
the
husband
,
What
did
you
get
in
return
that
was
worth
it
?
Margot
Wentz
said
,
looking
at
no
one
,
That
one
ca
n't
say
.
She
waggled
her
fingers
,
sticky
from
the
marshmallow
,
and
her
husband
took
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
her
.
It
was
the
evening
when
Bray
,
Neil
,
Evelyn
Odara
,
one
of
the
South
African
refugees
,
the
Pettigrews
,
and
a
few
others
set
off
for
the
Sputnik
Bar
.
While
Bray
was
standing
about
in
the
group
with
the
Odaras
and
the
Wentzes
,
Jo-Ann
Pettigrew
,
having
failed
to
get
him
to
eat
her
last
marshmallow
,
put
it
in
her
mouth
and
signalled
to
everyone
there
was
something
they
must
hear
.
Rebecca
's
been
to
the
Sputnik
and
she
says
it
's
terrific
now
.
They
've
knocked
out
a
wall
into
that
sort
of
yard
thing
and
they
have
dancing
.
With
girls
laid
on
.
Neil
said
,
Hey
?
And
which
one
of
us
's
been
taking
Rebecca
to
the
Sputnik
?
Laughter
rose
.
Well
,
why
do
n't
we
all
go
,
that
's
what
I
want
t'
know
.
The
young
Pettigrew
woman
was
always
in
a
state
of
enthusiasm
;
her
long
curly
hair
had
sprung
out
,
diademed
with
raindrops
,
because
she
had
done
her
marshmallow
toasting
outside
over
the
spit
fire
.
She
was
an
anthropologist
,
and
Bray
accepted
this
as
an
explanation
for
her
passion
for
arranging
excursions
,
on
which
she
carried
her
baby
tied
on
her
back
,
African
style
.
Who
was
it
?
There
was
a
roar
again
.
No
,
no
–
well
,
Ras
took
her
...
Oh
Ras
,
was
it
?
Sputnik
Bar
,
eh
?
So
that
's
it
,
now
.
Rebecca
Edwards
came
in
from
the
veranda
,
smiling
good-naturedly
,
inquiringly
,
under
the
remarks
shied
at
her
.
She
said
,
There
're
bulbs
like
you
see
in
films
round
the
star
's
dressing-table
,
and
they
light
up
and
spell
INDEPENDENCE
HURRAH
.
In
great
confusion
,
there
and
then
they
decided
to
go
.
Dando
refused
and
Vivien
had
to
go
home
to
the
children
,
and
Rebecca
Edwards
protested
that
hers
were
alone
too
.
Neil
insisted
that
Bray
must
come
;
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
,
late
at
night
,
suddenly
have
a
desperate
need
of
certain
companions
.
But
when
Neil
,
Bray
,
Evelyn
Odara
and
the
South
African
got
down
to
the
second-class
trading
area
,
the
others
had
n't
arrived
.
They
went
into
the
Sputnik
Bar
for
a
moment
,
meeting
music
like
a
buffeting
about
the
head
,
and
then
someone
said
that
he
thought
the
arrangement
had
been
to
meet
at
the
railway
crossing
.
There
began
one
of
those
chases
about
in
the
night
that
,
Bray
saw
,
Neil
Bayley
fiercely
enjoyed
.
They
went
all
the
way
back
into
town
to
the
flats
where
the
Edwards
girl
lived
...
Neil
stood
on
the
moonlit
patch
of
earth
in
front
of
the
dark
building
and
called
up
,
but
there
was
no
response
.
They
stopped
somewhere
to
give
a
man
a
lift
;
he
was
caught
in
the
lights
,
hat
in
hand
;
only
his
clean
white
shirt
had
shown
on
the
dark
road
.
He
answered
Neil
with
a
liberal
use
of
Bwana
,
as
a
white
man
would
expect
if
he
were
to
do
such
a
thing
as
stop
for
a
black
one
on
the
road
,
and
when
he
got
into
the
car
beside
Bray
and
the
South
African
,
sat
among
these
black
and
white
city
people
like
a
hedgehog
rolled
into
itself
at
a
touch
.
Bray
,
back
in
this
country
once
more
,
again
aware
of
his
own
height
and
size
and
pinkness
almost
like
some
form
of
aggression
he
was
n't
responsible
for
,
knew
that
the
fellow
was
holding
himself
away
from
contact
with
him
.
The
voices
of
Evelyn
,
Neil
,
and
the
South
African
flew
about
the
car
;
they
passed
the
shadows
of
the
mango
trees
in
the
bright
moonlight
lying
beneath
the
trees
like
sleeping
beasts
;
a
donkey
cropping
among
broken
china
on
a
refuse
mound
;
the
colours
on
the
mosque
almost
visible
,
the
silvered
burglar
grilles
on
the
elaborate
houses
of
the
Indian
sector
.
The
second-class
trading
area
had
been
laid
out
long
ago
and
haphazardly
;
shops
cropped
up
suddenly
,
streets
met
,
the
car
plunged
and
rolled
.
THE
WORST
BIRTHDAY
Not
for
the
first
time
,
an
argument
had
broken
out
over
breakfast
at
number
four
,
Privet
Drive
.
Mr
Vernon
Dursley
had
been
woken
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
by
a
loud
,
hooting
noise
from
his
nephew
Harry
's
room
.
Harry
tried
,
yet
again
,
to
explain
.
If
I
could
just
let
her
out
at
night
–
He
exchanged
dark
looks
with
his
wife
,
Petunia
.
Harry
tried
to
argue
back
but
his
words
were
drowned
by
a
long
,
loud
belch
from
the
Dursleys
son
,
Dudley
.
We
must
feed
you
up
while
we
've
got
the
chance
.
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
that
school
food
Dudley
,
who
was
so
large
his
bottom
drooped
over
either
side
of
the
kitchen
chair
,
grinned
and
turned
to
Harry
.
The
effect
of
this
simple
sentence
on
the
rest
of
the
family
was
incredible
:
Dudley
gasped
and
fell
off
his
chair
with
a
crash
that
shook
the
whole
kitchen
;
Mrs
Dursley
gave
a
small
scream
and
clapped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
;
Mr
Dursley
jumped
to
his
feet
,
veins
throbbing
in
his
temples
.
I
meant
"
please
"
!
said
Harry
quickly
.
Harry
stared
from
his
purple-faced
uncle
to
his
pale
aunt
,
who
was
trying
to
heave
Dudley
to
his
feet
.
Uncle
Vernon
sat
back
down
,
breathing
like
a
winded
rhinoceros
and
watching
Harry
closely
out
of
the
corners
of
his
small
,
sharp
eyes
.
ever
since
Harry
had
come
home
for
the
summer
holidays
,
Uncle
Vernon
had
been
treating
him
like
a
bomb
that
might
go
off
at
any
moment
,
because
Harry
Potter
was
n't
a
normal
boy
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
was
as
not
normal
as
it
is
possible
to
be
.
Harry
Potter
was
a
wizard
–
a
wizard
fresh
from
his
first
year
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
.
And
if
the
Dursleys
were
unhappy
to
have
him
back
for
the
holidays
,
it
was
nothing
to
how
Harry
felt
.
He
missed
Hogwarts
so
much
it
was
like
having
a
constant
stomach
ache
.
All
Harry
's
spellbooks
,
his
wand
,
robes
,
cauldron
and
top-of-the-range
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
broomstick
had
been
locked
in
a
cupboard
under
the
stairs
by
Uncle
Vernon
the
instant
Harry
had
come
home
.
What
did
the
Dursleys
care
if
Harry
lost
his
place
in
the
house
Quidditch
team
because
he
had
n't
practised
all
summer
?
What
was
it
to
the
Dursleys
if
Harry
went
back
to
school
without
any
of
his
homework
done
?
The
Dursleys
were
what
wizards
called
Muggles
(
not
a
drop
of
magical
blood
in
their
veins
)
and
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
,
having
a
wizard
in
the
family
was
a
matter
of
deepest
shame
.
Uncle
Vernon
had
even
padlocked
Harry
's
owl
,
Hedwig
,
inside
her
cage
,
to
stop
her
carrying
messages
to
anyone
in
the
wizarding
world
.
Harry
looked
nothing
like
the
rest
of
the
family
.
Uncle
Vernon
was
large
and
neckless
,
with
an
enormous
black
moustache
;
Aunt
Petunia
was
horse-faced
and
bony
;
Dudley
was
blond
,
pink
and
porky
.
Harry
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
small
and
skinny
,
with
brilliant
green
eyes
and
jet-black
hair
that
was
always
untidy
.
He
wore
round
glasses
,
and
on
his
forehead
was
a
thin
,
lightning-shaped
scar
.
It
was
this
scar
that
made
Harry
so
particularly
unusual
,
even
for
a
wizard
.
This
scar
was
the
only
hint
of
Harry
's
very
mysterious
past
,
of
the
reason
he
had
been
left
on
the
Dursleys
doorstep
eleven
years
before
.
At
the
age
of
one
,
Harry
had
somehow
survived
a
curse
from
the
greatest
dark
sorcerer
of
all
time
,
Lord
Voldemort
,
whose
name
most
witches
and
wizards
still
feared
to
speak
.
Harry
's
parents
had
died
in
Voldemort
's
attack
,
but
Harry
had
escaped
with
his
lightning
scar
,
and
somehow
–
nobody
understood
why
–
Voldemort
's
powers
had
been
destroyed
the
instant
he
had
failed
to
kill
Harry
.
So
Harry
had
been
brought
up
by
his
dead
mother
's
sister
and
her
husband
.
He
had
spent
ten
years
with
the
Dursleys
,
never
understanding
why
he
kept
making
odd
things
happen
without
meaning
to
,
believing
the
Dursleys
story
that
he
had
got
his
scar
in
the
car
crash
which
had
killed
his
parents
.
And
then
,
exactly
a
year
ago
,
Hogwarts
had
written
to
Harry
,
and
the
whole
story
had
come
out
.
Harry
had
taken
up
his
place
at
wizard
school
,
where
he
and
his
scar
were
famous
,
but
now
the
school
year
was
over
,
and
he
was
back
with
the
Dursleys
for
the
summer
,
back
to
being
treated
like
a
dog
that
had
rolled
in
something
smelly
.
The
Dursleys
had
n't
even
remembered
that
today
happened
to
be
Harry
's
twelfth
birthday
.
of
course
,
his
hopes
had
n't
been
high
;
they
'd
never
given
him
a
proper
present
,
let
alone
a
cake
–
but
to
ignore
it
completely
.
Harry
looked
up
,
hardly
daring
to
believe
it
.
This
could
well
be
the
day
I
make
the
biggest
deal
of
my
career
,
said
Uncle
Vernon
.
Harry
went
back
to
his
toast
.
of
course
,
he
thought
bitterly
,
Uncle
Vernon
was
talking
about
the
stupid
dinner
party
.
He
'd
been
talking
of
nothing
else
for
a
fortnight
.
Some
rich
builder
and
his
wife
were
coming
to
dinner
and
Uncle
Vernon
was
hoping
to
get
a
huge
order
from
him
(
Uncle
Vernon
's
company
made
drills
)
.
Good
,
good
.
Dudley
put
on
a
foul
,
simpering
smile
.
Excellent
,
Dudley
,
said
Uncle
Vernon
.
Then
he
rounded
on
Harry
.
At
eight
fifteen
–
And
you
?
said
Uncle
Vernon
viciously
to
Harry
.
Now
,
we
should
aim
to
get
in
a
few
good
compliments
at
dinner
.
Do
tell
me
where
you
bought
your
dress
,
Mrs
Mason
This
was
too
much
for
both
Aunt
Petunia
and
Harry
.
Aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
and
hugged
her
son
,
while
Harry
ducked
under
the
table
so
they
would
n't
see
him
laughing
.
Harry
fought
to
keep
his
face
straight
as
he
emerged
.
Too
right
you
will
,
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
.
When
dinner
's
over
,
you
take
Mrs
Mason
back
to
the
lounge
for
coffee
,
Petunia
,
and
I
'll
bring
the
subject
round
to
drills
.
With
any
luck
,
I
'll
have
the
deal
signed
and
sealed
before
the
News
at
Ten
.
Harry
could
n't
feel
too
excited
about
this
.
He
did
n't
think
the
Dursleys
would
like
him
any
better
in
Majorca
than
they
did
in
Privet
Drive
.
Harry
left
through
the
back
door
.
It
was
a
brilliant
,
sunny
day
.
He
crossed
the
lawn
,
slumped
down
on
the
garden
bench
,
and
sang
under
his
breath
:
"
Happy
birthday
to
me
.
Happy
birthday
to
me
"
No
cards
,
no
presents
,
and
he
would
be
spending
the
evening
pretending
not
to
exist
.
He
gazed
miserably
into
the
hedge
.
He
had
never
felt
so
lonely
.
More
than
anything
else
at
Hogwarts
,
more
even
than
playing
Quidditch
,
Harry
missed
his
best
friends
,
Ron
Weasley
and
Hermione
Granger
.
They
,
however
,
did
n't
seem
to
be
missing
him
at
all
.
Neither
of
them
had
written
to
him
all
summer
,
even
though
Ron
had
said
he
was
going
to
ask
Harry
to
come
and
stay
.
Countless
times
,
Harry
had
been
on
the
point
of
unlocking
Hedwig
's
cage
by
magic
and
sending
her
to
Ron
and
Hermione
with
a
letter
,
but
it
was
n't
worth
the
risk
.
Underage
wizards
were
n't
allowed
to
use
magic
outside
school
.
Harry
had
n't
told
the
Dursleys
this
;
he
knew
it
was
only
their
terror
that
he
might
turn
them
all
into
dung
beetles
that
stopped
them
locking
him
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
with
his
wand
and
broomstick
.
For
the
first
couple
of
weeks
back
,
Harry
had
enjoyed
muttering
nonsense
words
under
his
breath
and
watching
Dudley
tearing
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
his
fat
legs
would
carry
him
.
But
the
long
silence
from
Ron
and
Hermione
had
made
Harry
feel
so
cut
off
from
the
magical
world
that
even
taunting
Dudley
had
lost
its
appeal
–
and
now
Ron
and
Hermione
had
forgotten
his
birthday
.
What
would
n't
he
give
now
for
a
message
from
Hogwarts
?
From
any
witch
or
wizard
?
He
'd
almost
be
glad
of
a
sight
of
his
arch-enemy
,
Draco
Malfoy
,
just
to
be
sure
it
had
n't
all
been
a
dream
.
Not
that
his
whole
year
at
Hogwarts
had
been
fun
.
At
the
very
end
of
last
term
,
Harry
had
come
face
to
face
with
none
other
than
Lord
Voldemort
himself
.
Voldemort
might
be
a
ruin
of
his
former
self
,
but
he
was
still
terrifying
,
still
cunning
,
still
determined
to
regain
power
.
Harry
had
slipped
through
Voldemort
's
clutches
for
a
second
time
,
but
it
had
been
a
narrow
escape
,
and
even
now
,
weeks
later
,
Harry
kept
waking
in
the
night
,
drenched
in
cold
sweat
,
wondering
where
Voldemort
was
now
,
remembering
his
livid
face
,
his
wide
,
mad
eyes
.
Harry
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
garden
bench
.
He
had
been
staring
absent-mindedly
into
the
hedge
–
and
the
hedge
was
staring
back
.
Two
enormous
green
eyes
had
appeared
among
the
leaves
.
Harry
jumped
to
his
feet
just
as
a
jeering
voice
floated
across
the
lawn
.
The
huge
eyes
blinked
and
vanished
.
So
you
've
finally
learned
the
days
of
the
week
.
Dudley
hitched
up
his
trousers
,
which
were
slipping
down
his
fat
bottom
.
Why
're
you
staring
at
the
hedge
?
he
said
suspiciously
.
Dudley
stumbled
backwards
at
once
,
a
look
of
panic
on
his
fat
face
.
MUUUUUUM
!
howled
Dudley
,
tripping
over
his
feet
as
he
dashed
back
towards
the
house
.
Harry
paid
dearly
for
his
moment
of
fun
.
As
neither
Dudley
nor
the
hedge
was
in
any
way
hurt
,
Aunt
Petunia
knew
he
had
n't
really
done
magic
,
but
he
still
had
to
duck
as
she
aimed
a
heavy
blow
at
his
head
with
the
soapy
frying
pan
.
Then
she
gave
him
work
to
do
,
with
the
promise
he
would
n't
eat
again
until
he
'd
finished
.
While
Dudley
lolled
around
watching
and
eating
ice-creams
,
Harry
cleaned
the
windows
,
washed
the
car
,
mowed
the
lawn
,
trimmed
the
flowerbeds
,
pruned
and
watered
the
roses
and
repainted
the
garden
bench
.
The
sun
blazed
overhead
,
burning
the
back
of
his
neck
.
Harry
knew
he
should
n't
have
risen
to
Dudley
's
bait
,
but
Dudley
had
said
the
very
thing
Harry
had
been
thinking
himself
maybe
he
did
n't
have
any
friends
at
Hogwarts
Wish
they
could
see
famous
Harry
Potter
now
,
he
thought
savagely
,
as
he
spread
manure
on
the
flower
beds
,
his
back
aching
,
sweat
running
down
his
face
.
Harry
moved
gladly
into
the
shade
of
the
gleaming
kitchen
.
On
top
of
the
fridge
stood
tonight
's
pudding
:
a
huge
mound
of
whipped
cream
and
sugared
violets
.
A
joint
of
roast
pork
was
sizzling
in
the
oven
.
Eat
quickly
!
She
was
already
wearing
a
salmon-pink
cocktail
dress
.
Harry
washed
his
hands
and
bolted
down
his
pitiful
supper
.
The
moment
he
had
finished
,
Aunt
Petunia
whisked
away
his
plate
.
As
he
passed
the
door
to
the
living
room
,
Harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
Uncle
Vernon
and
Dudley
in
bow-ties
and
dinner
jackets
.
He
had
only
just
reached
the
upstairs
landing
when
the
door
bell
rang
and
Uncle
Vernon
's
furious
face
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
Harry
crossed
to
his
bedroom
on
tiptoe
,
slipped
inside
,
closed
the
door
and
turned
to
collapse
on
his
bed
.
The
trouble
was
,
there
was
already
someone
sitting
on
it
.
Harry
managed
not
to
shout
out
,
but
it
was
a
close
thing
.
The
little
creature
on
the
bed
had
large
,
bat-like
ears
and
bulging
green
eyes
the
size
of
tennis
balls
.
Harry
knew
instantly
that
this
was
what
had
been
watching
him
out
of
the
garden
hedge
that
morning
.
As
they
stared
at
each
other
,
Harry
heard
Dudley
's
voice
from
the
hall
.
May
I
take
your
coats
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Mason
?
The
creature
slipped
off
the
bed
and
bowed
so
low
that
the
end
of
its
long
thin
nose
touched
the
carpet
.
Harry
noticed
that
it
was
wearing
what
looked
like
an
old
pillowcase
,
with
rips
for
arm
and
leg
holes
.
Th-thank
you
,
said
Harry
,
edging
along
the
wall
and
sinking
into
his
desk
chair
,
next
to
Hedwig
,
who
was
asleep
in
her
large
cage
.
Just
Dobby
.
Er
–
I
do
n't
want
to
be
rude
or
anything
,
but
–
this
is
n't
a
great
time
for
me
to
have
a
house-elf
in
my
bedroom
.
Aunt
Petunias
high
,
false
laugh
sounded
from
the
living
room
.
The
elf
hung
his
head
.
People
goggled
through
the
bars
at
him
as
he
lay
,
starving
and
weak
,
on
a
bed
of
straw
.
Then
the
Dursleys
appeared
and
Dudley
rattled
the
bars
of
the
cage
,
laughing
at
him
.
Leave
me
alone
.
Cut
it
out
.
I
'm
trying
to
sleep
.
He
opened
his
eyes
.
Moonlight
was
shining
through
the
bars
on
the
window
.
And
someone
was
goggling
through
the
bars
at
him
:
a
freckle-faced
,
red-haired
,
long-nosed
someone
.
Ron
Weasley
was
outside
Harry
's
window
.
Harry
's
mouth
fell
open
as
the
full
impact
of
what
he
was
seeing
hit
him
.
Ron
was
leaning
out
of
the
back
window
of
an
old
turquoise
car
,
which
was
parked
in
mid-air
.
Grinning
at
Harry
from
the
front
seats
were
Fred
and
George
,
Ron
's
elder
twin
brothers
.
Why
have
n't
you
been
answering
my
letters
?
Bit
rich
coming
from
you
,
said
Harry
,
staring
at
the
floating
car
.
Stop
gibbering
,
said
Ron
,
we
've
come
to
take
you
home
with
us
.
If
the
Dursleys
wake
up
,
I
'm
dead
,
said
Harry
as
he
tied
the
rope
tightly
around
a
bar
and
Fred
revved
up
the
car
.
Harry
moved
back
into
the
shadows
next
to
Hedwig
,
who
seemed
to
have
realised
how
important
this
was
and
kept
still
and
silent
.
The
car
revved
louder
and
louder
and
suddenly
,
with
a
crunching
noise
,
the
bars
were
pulled
clean
out
of
the
window
as
Fred
drove
straight
up
in
the
air
–
Harry
ran
back
to
the
window
to
see
the
bars
dangling
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
.
Panting
,
Ron
hoisted
them
up
into
the
car
.
Harry
listened
anxiously
,
but
there
was
no
sound
from
the
Dursleys
bedroom
.
When
the
bars
were
safely
in
the
back
seat
with
Ron
,
Fred
reversed
as
close
as
possible
to
Harry
's
window
.
Locked
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
out
of
this
room
–
Fred
and
George
climbed
carefully
through
the
window
into
Harry
's
room
.
You
had
to
hand
it
to
them
,
thought
Harry
,
as
George
took
an
ordinary
hairpin
from
his
pocket
and
started
to
pick
the
lock
.
There
was
a
small
click
and
the
door
swung
open
.
Watch
out
for
the
bottom
stair
,
it
creaks
,
Harry
whispered
back
,
as
the
twins
disappeared
onto
the
dark
landing
.
Harry
dashed
around
his
room
,
collecting
his
things
together
and
passing
them
out
of
the
window
to
Ron
.
Then
he
went
to
help
Fred
and
George
heave
his
trunk
up
the
stairs
.
Harry
heard
Uncle
Vernon
cough
.
At
last
,
panting
,
they
reached
the
landing
,
then
carried
the
trunk
through
Harry
's
room
to
the
open
window
.
Fred
climbed
back
into
the
car
to
pull
with
Ron
,
and
Harry
and
George
pushed
from
the
bedroom
side
.
Inch
by
inch
,
the
trunk
slid
through
the
window
.
Uncle
Vernon
coughed
again
.
Harry
and
George
threw
their
shoulders
against
the
trunk
and
it
slid
out
of
the
window
into
the
back
seat
of
the
car
.
But
as
Harry
climbed
onto
the
window-sill
there
came
a
sudden
loud
screech
from
behind
him
,
followed
immediately
by
the
thunder
of
Uncle
Vernon
's
voice
.
Harry
tore
back
across
the
room
as
the
landing
light
clicked
on
.
He
snatched
up
Hedwig
's
cage
,
dashed
to
the
window
and
passed
it
out
to
Ron
.
He
was
scrambling
back
onto
the
chest
of
drawers
when
Uncle
Vernon
hammered
on
the
unlocked
door
–
and
it
crashed
open
.
For
a
split
second
,
Uncle
Vernon
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
;
then
he
let
out
a
bellow
like
an
angry
bull
and
dived
at
Harry
,
grabbing
him
by
the
ankle
.
Ron
,
Fred
and
George
seized
Harry
's
arms
and
pulled
as
hard
as
they
could
.
Petunia
!
roared
Uncle
Vernon
.
But
the
Weasleys
gave
a
gigantic
tug
and
Harry
's
leg
slid
out
of
Uncle
Vernon
's
grasp
.
Harry
could
n't
believe
it
–
he
was
free
.
He
wound
down
the
window
,
the
night
air
whipping
his
hair
,
and
looked
back
at
the
shrinking
rooftops
of
Privet
Drive
.
Uncle
Vernon
,
Aunt
Petunia
,
and
Dudley
were
all
hanging
,
dumbstruck
,
out
of
Harry
's
window
.
The
Weasleys
roared
with
laughter
and
Harry
settled
back
in
his
seat
,
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
Let
Hedwig
out
,
he
told
Ron
.
She
can
fly
behind
us
.
George
handed
the
hairpin
to
Ron
and
a
moment
later
,
Hedwig
had
soared
joyfully
out
of
the
window
to
glide
alongside
them
like
a
ghost
.
Harry
told
them
all
about
Dobby
,
the
warning
he
'd
given
Harry
and
the
fiasco
of
the
violet
pudding
.
There
was
a
long
shocked
silence
when
he
had
finished
.
Definitely
dodgy
agreed
George
.
He
saw
Fred
and
George
look
at
each
other
.
Well
,
said
Fred
,
put
it
this
way
–
house-elves
have
got
powerful
magic
of
their
own
,
but
they
ca
n't
usually
use
it
without
their
master
's
permission
.
I
reckon
old
Dobby
was
sent
to
stop
you
coming
back
to
Hogwarts
.
Someone
's
idea
of
a
joke
.
Draco
Malfoy
?
said
George
,
turning
around
.
He
was
a
big
supporter
of
You
Know
Who
.
Harry
had
heard
these
rumours
about
Malfoy
's
family
before
,
and
they
did
n't
surprise
him
at
all
.
Draco
Malfoy
made
Dudley
Dursley
look
like
a
kind
,
thoughtful
and
sensitive
boy
.
Yeah
,
Mum
's
always
wishing
we
had
a
house-elf
to
do
the
ironing
,
said
George
.
Harry
was
silent
.
Judging
by
the
fact
that
Draco
Malfoy
usually
had
the
best
of
everything
,
his
family
were
rolling
in
wizard
gold
;
he
could
just
see
Malfoy
strutting
around
a
large
manor
house
.
Sending
the
family
servant
to
stop
Harry
from
going
back
to
Hogwarts
also
sounded
exactly
like
the
sort
of
thing
Malfoy
would
do
.
Had
Harry
been
stupid
to
take
Dobby
seriously
?
I
thought
it
was
Errol
's
fault
at
first
–
He
's
ancient
.
It
would
n't
be
the
first
time
he
'd
collapsed
on
a
delivery
.
The
owl
Mum
and
Dad
bought
Percy
when
he
was
made
a
prefect
,
said
Fred
from
the
front
.
I
mean
,
there
's
only
so
many
times
you
can
polish
a
prefect
badge
.
You
're
driving
too
far
west
,
Fred
,
he
added
,
pointing
at
a
compass
on
the
dashboard
.
Fred
twiddled
the
steering
wheel
.
He
works
in
the
most
boring
department
,
said
Ron
.
Like
,
last
year
,
some
old
witch
died
and
her
tea
set
was
sold
to
an
antiques
shop
.
This
Muggle
woman
bought
it
,
took
it
home
and
tried
to
serve
her
friends
tea
in
it
.
What
happened
?
Fred
laughed
.
He
takes
it
apart
,
puts
spells
on
it
and
puts
it
back
together
again
.
If
he
raided
our
house
he
'd
have
to
put
himself
straight
under
arrest
.
It
drives
Mum
mad
.
A
faint
pinkish
glow
was
visible
along
the
horizon
to
the
east
.
Fred
brought
the
car
lower
and
Harry
saw
a
dark
patchwork
of
fields
and
clumps
of
trees
.
Lower
and
lower
went
the
flying
car
.
The
edge
of
a
brilliant
red
sun
was
now
gleaming
through
the
trees
.
Touchdown
!
said
Fred
as
,
with
a
slight
bump
,
they
hit
the
ground
.
They
had
landed
next
to
a
tumbledown
garage
in
a
small
yard
and
Harry
looked
out
for
the
first
time
at
Ron
's
house
.
It
looked
as
though
it
had
once
been
a
large
stone
pigsty
,
but
extra
rooms
had
been
added
here
and
there
until
it
was
several
storeys
high
and
so
crooked
it
looked
as
though
it
was
held
up
by
magic
(
which
,
Harry
reminded
himself
,
it
probably
was
)
.
Four
or
five
chimneys
were
perched
on
top
of
the
red
roof
.
Round
the
front
door
lay
a
jumble
of
wellington
boots
and
a
very
rusty
cauldron
.
Several
fat
brown
chickens
were
pecking
their
way
around
the
yard
.
They
got
out
of
the
car
.
Then
,
Ron
,
you
come
bounding
downstairs
going
,
Mum
,
look
who
turned
up
in
the
night
!
and
she
'll
be
all
pleased
to
see
Harry
and
no
one
need
ever
know
we
flew
the
car
.
Ron
had
gone
a
nasty
greenish
colour
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
house
.
The
other
three
wheeled
around
.
Mrs
Weasley
was
marching
across
the
yard
,
scattering
chickens
,
and
for
a
short
,
plump
,
kind-faced
woman
,
it
was
remarkable
how
much
she
looked
like
a
saber-toothed
tiger
.
Mrs
Weasley
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
them
,
her
hands
on
her
hips
,
staring
from
one
guilty
face
to
the
next
.
She
was
wearing
a
flowered
apron
with
a
wand
sticking
out
of
the
pocket
.
So
,
she
said
.
All
three
of
Mrs
Weasley
's
sons
were
taller
than
she
was
,
but
they
cowered
as
her
rage
broke
over
them
.
No
note
!
Car
gone
could
have
crashed
out
of
my
mind
with
worry
did
you
care
?
never
,
as
long
as
I
've
lived
you
wait
until
your
father
gets
home
,
we
never
had
trouble
like
this
from
Bill
or
Charlie
or
Percy
It
seemed
to
go
on
for
hours
.
Mrs
Weasley
had
shouted
herself
hoarse
before
she
turned
on
Harry
,
who
backed
away
.
Come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
.
She
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
house
and
Harry
,
after
a
nervous
glance
at
Ron
,
who
nodded
encouragingly
,
followed
her
.
The
kitchen
was
small
and
rather
cramped
.
There
was
a
scrubbed
wooden
table
and
chairs
in
the
middle
and
Harry
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
seat
,
looking
around
.
He
had
never
been
in
a
wizard
house
before
.
The
clock
on
the
wall
opposite
him
had
only
one
hand
and
no
numbers
at
all
.
Books
were
stacked
three
deep
on
the
mantelpiece
,
books
with
titles
like
Charm
Your
Own
Cheese
,
Enchantment
in
Baking
,
and
One
Minute
Feasts
–
It
's
Magic
!
Mrs
Weasley
was
clattering
around
,
cooking
breakfast
a
little
haphazardly
,
throwing
dirty
looks
at
her
sons
as
she
threw
sausages
into
the
frying
pan
.
Arthur
and
I
have
been
worried
about
you
,
too
.
Just
last
night
we
were
saying
we
'd
come
and
get
you
ourselves
if
you
had
n't
written
back
to
Ron
by
Friday
.
She
flicked
her
wand
casually
at
the
washing-up
in
the
sink
,
which
began
to
clean
itself
,
clinking
gently
in
the
background
.
and
you
!
said
Mrs
Weasley
,
but
it
was
with
a
slightly
softened
expression
that
she
started
cutting
Harry
bread
and
buttering
it
for
him
.
At
that
moment
,
there
was
a
diversion
in
the
form
of
a
small
,
red-headed
figure
in
a
long
nightdress
,
who
appeared
in
the
kitchen
,
gave
a
small
squeal
,
and
ran
out
again
.
Nothing
more
was
said
until
all
four
plates
were
clean
,
which
took
a
surprisingly
short
time
.
Blimey
,
I
'm
tired
,
yawned
Fred
,
setting
down
his
knife
and
fork
at
last
.
Oh
,
Mum
–
That
's
very
sweet
of
you
,
dear
,
but
it
's
dull
work
,
said
Mrs
Weasley
.
And
she
pulled
a
heavy
book
from
the
stack
on
the
mantelpiece
.
George
groaned
.
Harry
looked
at
the
cover
of
Mrs
Weasley
's
book
.
Written
across
it
in
fancy
gold
letters
were
the
words
:
Gilderoy
Lockhart
's
Guide
to
Household
Pests
.
He
'll
be
fine
,
Molly
,
do
n't
fuss
,
said
Mr
Weasley
,
helping
himself
to
Floo
powder
,
too
.
Now
,
when
you
get
into
the
fire
,
say
where
you
're
going
–
Or
you
might
well
fall
out
of
the
wrong
fireplace
–
Trying
hard
to
bear
all
this
in
mind
,
Harry
took
a
pinch
of
Floo
powder
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
fire
.
He
took
a
deep
breath
,
scattered
the
powder
into
the
flames
and
stepped
forward
;
the
fire
felt
like
a
warm
breeze
;
he
opened
his
mouth
and
immediately
swallowed
a
lot
of
hot
ash
.
It
felt
as
though
he
was
being
sucked
down
a
giant
plug
hole
.
He
seemed
to
be
spinning
very
fast
the
roaring
in
his
ears
was
deafening
he
tried
to
keep
his
eyes
open
but
the
whirl
of
green
flames
made
him
feel
sick
something
hard
knocked
his
elbow
and
he
tucked
it
in
tightly
,
still
spinning
and
spinning
now
it
felt
as
though
cold
hands
were
slapping
his
face
squinting
through
his
glasses
he
saw
a
blurred
stream
of
fireplaces
and
snatched
glimpses
of
the
rooms
beyond
his
bacon
sandwiches
were
churning
inside
him
.
He
closed
his
eyes
again
wishing
it
would
stop
,
and
then
–
he
fell
,
face
forward
,
onto
cold
stone
and
felt
his
glasses
shatter
.
Dizzy
and
bruised
,
covered
in
soot
,
he
got
gingerly
to
his
feet
,
holding
his
broken
glasses
up
to
his
eyes
.
He
was
quite
alone
,
but
where
he
was
,
he
had
no
idea
.
All
he
could
tell
was
that
he
was
standing
in
the
stone
fireplace
of
what
looked
like
a
large
,
dimly
lit
wizard
's
shop
–
but
nothing
in
here
was
ever
likely
to
be
on
a
Hogwarts
school
list
.
A
glass
case
nearby
held
a
withered
hand
on
a
cushion
,
a
blood-stained
pack
of
cards
,
and
a
staring
glass
eye
.
Evil-looking
masks
stared
down
from
the
walls
,
an
assortment
of
human
bones
lay
upon
the
counter
,
and
rusty
,
spiked
instruments
hung
from
the
ceiling
.
Even
worse
,
the
dark
,
narrow
street
Harry
could
see
through
the
dusty
shop
window
was
definitely
not
Diagon
Alley
.
The
sooner
he
got
out
of
here
,
the
better
.
Harry
looked
quickly
around
and
spotted
a
large
black
cabinet
to
his
left
;
he
shot
inside
it
and
pulled
the
doors
to
leaving
a
small
crack
to
peer
through
.
Seconds
later
,
a
bell
clanged
,
and
Malfoy
stepped
into
the
shop
.
The
man
who
followed
could
only
be
his
father
.
He
had
the
same
pale
,
pointed
face
and
identical
cold
grey
eyes
.
I
said
I
would
buy
you
a
racing
broom
,
said
his
father
,
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
counter
.
Special
permission
from
Dumbledore
so
he
could
play
for
Gryffindor
.
Malfoy
bent
down
to
examine
a
shelf
full
of
skulls
.
A
stooping
man
had
appeared
behind
the
counter
,
smoothing
his
greasy
hair
back
from
his
face
.
Mr
Malfoy
,
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
,
said
Mr
Borgin
in
a
voice
as
oily
as
his
hair
.
How
may
I
be
of
assistance
?
The
smile
faded
slightly
from
Mr
Borgin
's
face
.
You
have
heard
,
of
course
,
that
the
Ministry
is
conducting
more
raids
,
said
Mr
Malfoy
,
taking
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
inside
pocket
and
unravelling
it
for
Mr
Borgin
to
read
.
Mr
Borgin
fixed
a
pince-nez
to
his
nose
and
looked
down
the
list
.
Mr
Malfoy
's
lip
curled
.
The
name
Malfoy
still
commands
a
certain
respect
,
yet
the
Ministry
grows
ever
more
meddlesome
.
Harry
felt
a
hot
surge
of
anger
.
–
and
as
you
see
,
certain
of
these
poisons
might
make
it
appear
–
Insert
a
candle
and
it
gives
light
only
to
the
holder
!
Best
friend
of
thieves
and
plunderers
!
The
teachers
all
have
favourites
,
that
Hermione
Granger
–
Not
with
me
,
said
Mr
Malfoy
,
his
long
nostrils
flaring
.
They
started
to
haggle
.
Harry
watched
nervously
as
Draco
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
hiding
place
,
examining
the
objects
for
sale
.
He
paused
to
examine
a
long
coil
of
hangman
's
rope
and
to
read
,
smirking
,
the
card
propped
on
a
magnificent
necklace
of
opals
:
Caution
:
Do
Not
Touch
.
Cursed
–
Has
Claimed
the
Lives
of
Nineteen
Muggle
Owners
to
Date
.
Draco
turned
away
and
saw
the
cabinet
right
in
front
of
him
.
He
walked
forward
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
handle
Come
,
Draco
!
Harry
wiped
his
forehead
on
his
sleeve
as
Draco
turned
away
.
The
moment
the
door
had
closed
,
Mr
Borgin
dropped
his
oily
manner
.
Muttering
darkly
,
Mr
Borgin
disappeared
into
a
back
room
.
Harry
waited
for
a
minute
in
case
he
came
back
,
then
,
quietly
as
he
could
,
slipped
out
of
the
cabinet
,
past
the
glass
cases
,
and
out
of
the
shop
door
.
Clutching
his
broken
glasses
to
his
face
he
stared
around
.
He
had
emerged
into
a
dingy
alleyway
that
seemed
to
be
made
up
entirely
of
shops
devoted
to
the
Dark
Arts
.
The
one
he
'd
just
left
,
Borgin
and
Burkes
,
looked
like
the
largest
,
but
opposite
was
a
nasty
window
display
of
shrunken
heads
,
and
two
doors
down
,
a
large
cage
was
alive
with
gigantic
black
spiders
.
Two
shabby-looking
wizards
were
watching
him
from
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
,
muttering
to
each
other
.
Feeling
jumpy
,
Harry
set
off
,
trying
to
hold
his
glasses
on
straight
and
hoping
against
hope
he
'd
be
able
to
find
a
way
out
of
there
.
An
old
wooden
street
sign
hanging
over
a
shop
selling
poisonous
candles
told
him
he
was
in
Knockturn
Alley
.
This
did
n't
help
,
as
Harry
had
never
heard
of
such
a
place
.
He
supposed
he
had
n't
spoken
clearly
enough
through
his
mouthful
of
ashes
back
in
the
Weasleys
fire
.
Trying
to
stay
calm
,
he
wondered
what
to
do
.
An
aged
witch
stood
in
front
of
him
,
holding
a
tray
of
what
looked
horribly
like
whole
human
fingernails
.
She
leered
at
him
,
showing
mossy
teeth
.
Harry
backed
away
.
I
'm
just
–
Harry
's
heart
leapt
.
Hagrid
seized
Harry
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
pulled
him
away
from
the
witch
,
knocking
the
tray
right
out
of
her
hands
.
Her
shrieks
followed
them
all
the
way
along
the
twisting
alleyway
out
into
bright
sunlight
.
Harry
saw
a
familiar
,
snow-white
marble
building
in
the
distance
:
Gringotts
Bank
.
Hagrid
had
steered
him
right
into
Diagon
Alley
.
Yer
a
mess
!
said
Hagrid
gruffly
,
brushing
soot
off
Harry
so
forcefully
he
nearly
knocked
him
into
a
barrel
of
dragon
dung
outside
an
apothecary
's
.
They
're
ruinin'
the
school
cabbages
.
They
set
off
together
down
the
street
.
Harry
explained
all
about
Dobby
and
the
Dursleys
.
Ruddy
Muggles
,
growled
Hagrid
.
Harry
looked
up
and
saw
Hermione
Granger
standing
at
the
top
of
the
white
flight
of
steps
to
Gringotts
.
She
ran
down
to
meet
them
,
her
bushy
brown
hair
flying
behind
her
.
Hello
,
Hagrid
Oh
,
it
's
wonderful
to
see
you
two
again
Are
you
coming
into
Gringotts
,
Harry
?
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
around
:
sprinting
up
the
crowded
street
were
Ron
,
Fred
,
George
,
Percy
and
Mr
Weasley
.
He
mopped
his
glistening
bald
patch
.
Molly
's
frantic
–
she
's
coming
now
.
I
should
ruddy
well
think
not
,
growled
Hagrid
.
Mrs
Weasley
now
came
galloping
into
view
,
her
handbag
swinging
wildly
in
one
hand
,
Ginny
just
clinging
onto
the
other
.
Gasping
for
breath
she
pulled
a
large
clothes
brush
out
of
her
bag
and
began
sweeping
off
the
soot
Hagrid
had
n't
managed
to
beat
away
.
Mr
Weasley
took
Harry
's
glasses
,
gave
them
a
tap
of
his
wand
and
returned
them
,
good
as
new
.
And
he
strode
away
,
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
anyone
else
in
the
packed
street
.
Guess
who
I
saw
in
Borgin
and
Burkes
?
Harry
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
as
they
climbed
the
Gringotts
steps
.
Oh
,
I
'd
love
to
get
Lucius
Malfoy
for
something
What
's
that
you
've
got
there
?
Oh
,
you
're
changing
Muggle
money
.
Molly
,
look
!
He
pointed
excitedly
at
the
tenpound
notes
in
Mr
Granger
's
hand
.
The
vaults
were
reached
by
means
of
small
,
goblin-driven
carts
that
sped
along
miniature
train-tracks
through
the
bank
's
underground
tunnels
.
Harry
enjoyed
the
breakneck
journey
down
to
the
Weasleys
vault
,
but
felt
dreadful
,
far
worse
than
he
had
in
Knockturn
Alley
,
when
it
was
opened
.
There
was
a
very
small
pile
of
silver
Sickles
inside
,
and
just
one
gold
Galleon
.
Mrs
Weasley
felt
right
into
the
corners
before
sweeping
the
whole
lot
into
her
bag
.
Harry
felt
even
worse
when
they
reached
his
vault
.
He
tried
to
block
the
contents
from
view
as
he
hastily
shoved
handfuls
of
coins
into
a
leather
bag
.
Back
outside
on
the
marble
steps
,
they
all
separated
.
Percy
muttered
vaguely
about
needing
a
new
quill
.
Fred
and
George
had
spotted
their
friend
from
Hogwarts
,
Lee
Jordan
.
Mrs
Weasley
and
Ginny
were
going
to
a
second-hand
robe
shop
.
Mr
Weasley
was
insisting
on
taking
the
Grangers
off
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
for
a
drink
.
Harry
,
Ron
and
Hermione
strolled
off
along
the
winding
,
cobbled
street
.
The
bag
of
gold
,
silver
and
bronze
jangling
cheerfully
in
Harry
's
pocket
was
clamouring
to
be
spent
,
so
he
bought
three
large
strawberry
and
peanut-butter
ice-creams
which
they
slurped
happily
as
they
wandered
up
the
alley
,
examining
the
fascinating
shop
windows
.
A
study
of
Hogwarts
prefects
and
their
later
careers
,
Ron
read
aloud
off
the
back
cover
.
An
hour
later
,
they
headed
for
Flourish
and
Blotts
.
They
were
by
no
means
the
only
ones
making
their
way
to
the
bookshop
.
As
they
approached
it
,
they
saw
to
their
surprise
a
large
crowd
jostling
outside
the
doors
,
trying
to
get
in
.
The
reason
for
this
was
proclaimed
by
a
large
banner
stretched
across
the
upper
windows
:
GILDEROY
LOCKHART
will
be
signing
copies
of
his
autobiography
MAGICAL
ME
today
12:30
to
4:30
pm
.
I
mean
,
he
's
written
almost
the
whole
booklist
!
Harry
,
Ron
,
and
Hermione
squeezed
inside
.
A
long
line
wound
right
to
the
back
of
the
shop
,
where
Gilderoy
Lockhart
was
signing
his
books
.
They
each
grabbed
a
copy
of
Break
with
a
Banshee
,
and
sneaked
up
the
line
to
where
the
rest
of
the
Weasleys
were
standing
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Granger
.
She
sounded
breathless
and
kept
patting
her
hair
.
Gilderoy
Lockhart
came
slowly
into
view
,
seated
at
a
table
surrounded
by
large
pictures
of
his
own
face
,
all
winking
and
flashing
dazzlingly
white
teeth
at
the
crowd
.
The
real
Lockhart
was
wearing
robes
of
forget-me-not
blue
which
exactly
matched
his
eyes
;
his
pointed
wizard
's
hat
was
set
at
a
jaunty
angle
on
his
wavy
hair
.
A
short
,
irritable-looking
man
was
dancing
around
taking
photographs
with
a
large
black
camera
that
emitted
puffs
of
purple
smoke
with
every
blinding
flash
.
Yes
,
look
at
her
,
bunioned
,
bulbous
,
hair
in
bulrush
rolls
,
butt-headed
,
butter-hearted
and
tenacious
as
a
buckaroo
.
I
had
seen
it
happen
to
others
.
I
did
not
want
it
to
happen
to
me
.
Fate
.
A
spin
on
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
and
out
I
tumbled
at
Jove
's
feet
.
Another
dizzy
round
,
and
there
is
Stella
waiting
to
help
me
off
.
But
who
is
turning
the
wheel
?
Honest
Guv
'
I
had
both
hands
tied
behind
my
back
.
Neither
my
mother
nor
my
father
were
able
to
cope
with
the
1960s
.
Skirts
were
too
short
,
hair
was
too
long
,
and
the
favoured
colour
combination
of
purple
and
orange
made
my
mother
look
like
a
vampire
and
my
father
a
Matisse
.
They
were
peculiarly
ill-placed
for
the
general
assault
on
the
past
that
the
Sixties
represented
because
they
lived
in
Liverpool
.
Liverpool
,
that
should
have
slumbered
its
way
through
the
Sixties
as
it
had
every
other
decade
,
produced
the
Beatles
.
My
parents
were
victims
of
the
Merseybeat
.
I
was
born
in
a
tug-boat
.
My
mother
whelped
me
in
a
mess
of
blankets
while
my
noctivagant
father
towed
in
the
big
ships
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
seriousness
of
our
business
that
pushed
us
both
into
laughter
,
extremes
of
emotion
so
easily
tumbling
into
their
opposites
.
Yet
there
was
relief
for
us
to
find
a
human
face
behind
the
monster
mask
;
the
monster
wife
,
the
monster
mistress
,
and
what
about
the
monster
man
?
Tell
the
story
as
it
happened
.
Why
then
did
I
trouble
the
surface
?
It
was
not
myself
I
fell
in
love
with
it
was
her
.
'
Are
you
waiting
for
someone
?
'
I
said
.
'
I
was
.
'
'
We
're
going
to
live
in
London
,
'
he
said
.
'
Why
Daddy
?
'
'
Because
Daddy
has
a
new
job
.
'
Grandmother
was
here
,
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
woollens
,
her
face
entirely
obscured
by
a
seaman
's
balaclava
.
She
made
us
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
my
mother
swept
off
in
a
taxi
.
I
woke
up
in
the
dazed
apartment
.
Next
to
me
on
the
massacred
bed
,
the
order
and
beauty
of
her
body
.
On
the
table
beside
,
an
amputated
lamp
.
Across
the
room
was
a
Snow
Queen
's
mirror
,
its
pieces
scatters
of
despair
.
I
crept
from
beneath
the
scissored
blankets
to
the
bathroom
.
The
white
and
chrome
was
a
shrine
to
Chanel
.
A
place
for
everything
,
everything
in
its
place
.
Peace
.
One
day
when
my
mother
was
taking
me
to
school
,
the
streets
seemed
very
quiet
.
We
parked
,
although
we
were
the
only
car
on
the
stretch
of
road
,
and
we
got
out
to
walk
slowly
,
hand
in
hand
,
through
some
flimsy
barriers
of
paper
and
string
.
Far
away
we
saw
some
policemen
waving
at
us
and
we
waved
back
.
We
heard
a
lorry
coming
up
behind
and
my
mother
told
me
it
had
a
television
crew
on
board
which
excited
me
who
had
never
seen
a
television
.
Anything
that
had
been
on
the
market
for
as
little
as
ten
years
was
unlikely
to
impress
my
father
.
'
Are
you
happy
,
Alice
?
'
'
Yes
,
Daddy
.
'
It
should
have
been
fun
but
neither
of
them
was
happy
.
When
I
was
five
my
father
was
on
pills
and
my
mother
was
on
gin
.
I
think
I
was
happy
,
in
the
maddening
determined
way
that
children
have
of
being
happy
,
and
it
was
that
happiness
that
worked
as
a
magnet
on
both
of
my
parents
.
They
were
pulled
by
it
,
they
wanted
it
,
and
instead
of
taking
it
for
granted
,
they
started
to
take
it
to
bits
.
At
last
we
arrived
at
a
small
diner
in
a
beaten-up
part
of
town
.
She
swung
inside
and
we
sat
at
a
menacingly
nice
checked-cloth
table
with
red
carnations
and
a
few
rods
of
grissini
.
A
boy
came
out
with
a
carafe
of
red
wine
and
a
bowl
of
olives
.
He
handed
us
the
menus
as
if
this
was
just
an
ordinary
dinner
in
an
ordinary
day
.
I
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Borgias
and
now
they
wanted
me
to
eat
.
When
he
stopped
holding
me
up
to
the
light
he
began
to
hold
me
up
to
the
mirror
.
He
wanted
to
compare
us
,
side
by
side
,
did
I
look
like
him
?
He
had
enough
money
.
It
was
his
wife
they
were
draining
away
.
His
friends
interpreted
the
resentment
as
a
normal
response
to
a
difficult
situation
.
My
mother
took
the
simple
view
that
a
man
must
have
his
work
.
My
father
though
,
was
not
simple
and
he
was
still
aware
enough
to
turn
the
mask
over
and
over
in
his
hands
and
ask
what
it
was
.
Uncharacteristically
,
he
went
to
visit
my
grandmother
.
Months
later
,
proud
complacent
Zeus
had
a
headache
and
yowled
his
way
over
the
earth
,
threatening
to
split
the
firmament
with
pain
.
It
was
Hermes
who
told
him
the
source
of
his
trouble
,
and
Hephaestus
,
the
lame
god
of
the
smithy
who
took
a
hammer
and
wedge
and
split
open
Lord
Zeus
's
skull
.
Out
came
Athene
tall
strong
beautiful
and
her
father
's
own
.
'
You
must
be
bored
there
,
'
said
my
mother
.
But
that
was
in
the
future
,
and
in
1959
my
father
was
in
the
fullness
of
his
present
,
he
could
do
no
wrong
.
As
the
lorry
came
close
to
us
,
four
young
men
dressed
entirely
in
black
ran
past
.
Three
of
them
carried
guitars
,
one
had
a
set
of
drumsticks
.
I
had
seen
people
dressed
in
black
before
.
'
Wo
n't
hurt
,
'
said
Grandmother
.
'
Look
at
me
.
'
Husband
and
wife
.
Man
and
rib
.
What
could
be
more
normal
than
that
?
And
now
they
were
having
a
baby
.
That
is
,
my
mother
was
bearing
my
father
's
child
.
It
was
different
when
my
sisters
were
born
but
I
was
Athene
.
Athene
born
fully
formed
from
the
head
of
Zeus
.
My
father
no
longer
wanted
herring
heads
.
He
wanted
mink
and
pearls
and
he
got
them
.
Like
most
men
he
was
a
transvestite
at
one
remove
;
if
his
wife
was
part
of
him
so
were
her
clothes
.
She
was
his
rib
and
as
such
he
too
wore
a
silk
shift
.
He
loved
her
clothes
,
loved
to
see
her
dressed
up
,
it
satisfied
a
part
of
him
that
was
deeper
than
vanity
.
It
was
a
part
of
himself
.
She
completed
him
.
She
manifested
him
at
another
level
.
He
absorbed
her
while
she
failed
to
absorb
him
.
This
was
so
normal
that
nobody
noticed
it
.
At
least
not
until
later
,
much
later
,
when
things
began
to
change
.
Page
of
cups
Her
kitchen
had
strings
of
onions
and
fat
hams
hanging
in
glorious
torture
from
twisted
hooks
in
the
ceiling
.
She
smoked
her
own
kippers
up
the
chimney
,
skewering
them
in
pairs
with
discarded
knitting
needles
.
For
this
she
kept
a
wood
fire
.
The
other
fireplaces
were
fed
on
coal
.
She
had
a
glass-fronted
cabinet
lined
with
jars
of
homemade
preserve
;
pickles
,
tomatoes
,
pears
,
cabbage
,
and
in
the
middle
,
a
baby
rabbit
.
This
was
not
for
eating
.
It
was
an
ornament
.
When
the
wind
blew
and
the
cupboard
rattled
the
rabbit
bobbed
up
and
down
in
his
transparent
prison
,
his
ears
buckling
slightly
as
they
hit
the
lid
seal
.
Like
my
grandmother
he
kept
secrets
the
way
other
people
keep
fish
.
They
were
a
hobby
,
a
fascination
,
his
underwater
collection
of
the
rare
and
the
strange
.
Occasionally
something
would
float
up
to
the
surface
,
unexpected
,
unexplained
.
'
Tha
wife
's
to
give
birth
.
'
She
was
not
resourceful
;
her
class
did
not
allow
it
,
and
I
know
it
worried
my
grandmother
that
her
son
had
found
a
wife
who
did
not
know
how
to
make
a
soup
out
of
herring
's
heads
.
'
I
christen
this
child
...
'
He
did
n't
come
home
that
night
,
nor
the
night
after
.
The
telephone
rang
each
evening
at
six
o'clock
until
a
week
had
passed
.
My
mother
looked
vaguer
than
usual
and
kept
her
light
on
all
night
.
We
were
supposed
not
to
notice
.
Now
that
it
was
winter
the
house
was
dark
almost
all
day
and
the
frost
whitened
the
lawn
.
My
sisters
and
I
played
quietly
in
the
petrified
air
,
our
breath
briefly
warming
the
frozen
spaces
around
us
.
We
were
waiting
,
waiting
,
watching
the
clock
.
Before
we
left
we
went
to
see
my
headmaster
.
I
had
just
started
secondary
school
and
was
restless
and
inattentive
.
The
headmaster
,
noting
that
I
had
every
advantage
life
could
offer
,
assumed
that
I
was
either
a
bad
child
or
a
dull
one
.
He
was
too
afraid
of
my
rugger-square
father
to
use
either
of
those
words
,
at
least
I
know
that
now
,
but
at
the
time
I
believed
he
meant
what
he
said
.
For
the
next
eight
years
I
lived
shut
away
in
the
misery
of
his
drawer
.
At
that
second
the
car
was
rocked
on
every
side
by
thousands
of
screaming
girls
.
I
saw
their
faces
streaked
with
tears
pressed
in
agony
against
the
windows
and
windscreen
of
the
car
.
It
can
hardly
have
lasted
a
moment
;
they
realised
their
prey
was
elsewhere
and
vanished
as
devilishly
as
they
had
appeared
.
When
my
mother
got
out
to
talk
to
the
policeman
,
the
only
trace
of
what
had
happened
was
a
broken
banner
painted
HELP
!
The
furniture
was
plain
:
a
scrubbed
sycamore
table
,
a
deep
enamel
sink
,
a
few
unmatched
chairs
and
an
evil-smelling
Rayburn
that
left
soot
on
my
grandmother
's
scones
.
As
I
was
ready
to
go
with
my
nightcase
packed
,
my
mother
gave
me
a
bottle
of
disinfectant
.
'
For
the
out-house
,
'
she
said
.
'
Do
n't
tell
Grandmother
.
'
Do
n't
tell
Grandmother
.
My
grandmother
had
been
an
honorary
member
of
the
secret
police
since
she
was
born
.
It
was
impossible
to
hide
anything
from
her
.
As
I
came
through
the
back
door
into
her
kitchen
she
frisked
me
from
head
to
foot
,
removed
the
disinfectant
and
gave
me
a
pair
of
overalls
to
wear
.
'
Help
me
clean
out
the
toilet
,
'
she
said
.
I
was
strictly
forbidden
to
listen
to
the
Beatles
and
Beatles
music
was
strictly
forbidden
at
the
now
monthly
parties
my
parents
held
for
anyone
who
would
come
.
I
began
to
dread
the
parties
;
the
unknown
women
who
would
come
upstairs
to
cry
in
a
spare
bedroom
.
The
drunk
and
drunker
men
who
used
to
talk
about
the
war
and
hold
each
other
's
knees
.
I
persuaded
my
parents
to
let
me
go
and
stay
with
my
grandmother
on
party
nights
.
My
mother
was
reluctant
because
she
thought
my
grandmother
was
unhygienic
.
There
was
no
foundation
to
this
,
only
my
grandmother
's
absolute
refusal
to
fit
an
inside
toilet
or
to
attend
any
of
my
mother
's
Tupperware
evenings
.
'
Where
has
she
gone
?
'
'
Why
?
'
And
he
would
stare
at
me
in
that
way
of
his
,
trying
to
see
happiness
the
way
he
could
see
a
business
opportunity
.
'
Mob
rule
,
'
said
my
father
who
was
thinking
of
moving
to
Southampton
.
Poor
baby
,
passed
from
hand
to
hand
like
a
pouch
of
tobacco
,
a
fresh-faced
narcotic
promising
hope
,
change
,
at
least
for
now
.
My
family
are
addicted
to
sentimentality
.
If
that
sounds
cruel
it
is
only
the
cruelty
of
too
close
observation
for
too
long
.
Unable
to
express
their
feelings
in
the
normal
course
of
days
and
hours
they
need
every
legitimate
excuse
to
do
so
.
They
can
not
say
'
I
love
you
'
so
they
say
'
Is
n't
she
lovely
?
'
'
Well
done
.
'
They
can
seem
like
bon
viveurs
,
always
a
party
in
the
offing
,
my
mother
planning
a
new
recipe
for
canapés
even
in
the
act
of
stuffing
my
relatives
with
the
ones
she
has
just
made
.
When
they
reached
the
docks
my
father
backed
into
a
loading
bay
and
my
grandmother
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
.
June
8
1960
.
Liverpool
,
England
.
Sun
in
Gemini
.
Whilst
I
was
adjusting
to
this
unlikely
apparition
,
my
grandmother
was
doing
the
Twist
or
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
the
Wiggle
,
since
the
two
mobile
parts
were
her
bottom
and
her
head
.
Her
arms
,
bent
at
the
elbow
,
were
rigid
in
front
of
her
,
her
feet
were
planted
apart
.
'
Come
out
,
'
said
Grandmother
.
On
the
kitchen
table
was
a
brand-new
bright
blue
Danette
turntable
.
On
the
turntable
was
a
45r.p.m.
of
the
Beatles
singing
'
Help
!
'
When
we
had
finished
scooping
out
the
dunny
,
and
put
fresh
sawdust
in
the
bottom
to
activate
the
new
midden
,
my
grandmother
said
she
had
a
surprise
for
me
.
She
made
me
stand
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
behind
the
memorial
oilskin
,
while
she
wheezed
and
whirred
something
out
of
the
coal-hole
.
I
could
hear
a
crackling
and
a
scratching
and
what
sounded
like
fluff
on
the
end
of
a
record-player
needle
.
I
looked
at
the
menu
.
FOOD
TASTES

The
difficulty
.
Something
in
her
,
something
in
him
,
something
that
I
inherited
that
my
sisters
did
not
.
The

crieth

Aha
!
Why
wrestle
all
night
with
an
angel
when
the
fight
can
only
leave
you
lame
?
Why
not
walk
away
?
Why
not
sleep
?
He
had
been
taught
to
hold
my
head
and
to
support
my
unfixed
spine
,
and
I
seem
to
remember
sitting
solemnly
on
his
level
palm
,
trying
to
steady
the
out
of
focus
vision
of
him
,
anxious
,
intent
,
gazing
at
me
as
if
I
could
reveal
to
him
what
he
was
.
'
No
,
'
said
Grandmother
.
I
grew
.
At
nine
,
tall
and
silent
,
I
was
unhappy
.
My
father
,
who
had
given
up
his
religion
but
not
the
superstition
that
accompanied
it
,
interpreted
my
misery
as
proof
positive
of
Original
Sin
.
Since
there
could
be
no
reason
for
me
to
be
unhappy
,
unhappiness
must
be
the
human
condition
.
How
could
he
hope
to
escape
what
an
innocent
child
could
not
escape
?
Like
my
grandmother
,
he
had
a
Gothic
disposition
,
but
she
had
kept
her
God
and
therefore
her
mercy
.
My
father
could
find
no
mercy
for
himself
and
offered
none
.
'
Did
he
tell
you
that
?
'
'
This
is
where
I
met
him
,
'
she
said
.
'
In
1947
on
the
day
that
I
was
born
...
'
In
my
nightmares
Time
scooped
up
the
sea
in
his
hood
and
carried
it
away
.
He
stood
at
the
end
of
the
world
and
poured
the
sea
into
space
.
'
There
's
no
sea
there
is
there
?
'
No
one
will
doubt
that
my
father
had
wanted
a
boy
.
He
had
assumed
he
would
have
a
boy
.
Right
up
to
a
week
after
my
birth
he
continued
to
say
,
'
How
is
he
?
'
My
grandmother
told
me
that
he
had
turned
me
upside
down
in
his
huge
hands
and
held
me
V-legged
to
the
light
,
just
to
be
sure
that
my
genitals
were
n't
caught
inside
.
He
did
n't
trust
doctors
.
The
white
coat
and
stethoscope
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
hide-out
from
the
world
.
He
resented
the
superiority
,
the
authority
,
but
of
course
he
had
never
been
ill
.
She
would
be
greying
,
she
would
be
lined
,
she
would
be
overweight
,
she
would
be
clothes-careless
.
She
would
be
poetically
besocked
and
sandalled
,
her
eyes
behind
glass
,
like
museum
exhibits
.
I
could
see
her
,
hair
and
flesh
escaping
,
hope
trapped
inside
.
I
would
drain
her
to
the
sump
.
'
David
you
've
got
everything
you
wanted
.
'
'
What
did
I
want
?
'
'
Did
n't
you
want
to
be
somebody
?
'
'
Did
n't
you

'
My
parents
'
house
was
so
clean
it
made
me
ill
.
Much
has
been
aired
about
the
benefits
of
sanitation
but
less
is
told
about
the
eczema
of
washing
powder
,
the
asthma
of
fitted
carpets
,
allergic
reactions
to
cream
cleaner
,
itchy
fingers
round
the
bleach
bottle
,
drug-out
on
the
fumes
of
metal
polish
.
Worse
,
my
mother
had
discovered
nylon
,
so
easy
to
wash
,
and
ignored
my
athlete
's
foot
and
the
red
weals
between
my
legs
where
the
nylon
lace
of
the
nylon
knickers
warred
against
my
non-nylon
skin
.
Mother
and
daughter
,
secular
,
apart
.
Papa
beckoning
the
child
in
unwatched
moments
,
taking
her
into
his
secret
room
,
showing
her
symbols
and
precious
stones
.
She
had
navigated
her
parents
'
hostile
waters
with
a
child
's
discretion
,
learning
to
keep
from
one
the
confessions
of
the
other
.
Learning
to
hide
love
.
My
grandmother
got
down
a
pair
of
kippers
and
broiled
them
for
us
in
butter
and
water
.
She
asked
me
about
my
father
,
watching
my
body
not
listening
to
what
I
said
,
what
could
I
say
?
I
loved
him
and
he
frightened
me
.
'
My
mistake
,
'
she
said
talking
to
herself
.
'
My
mistake
.
'
They
did
not
speak
of
it
again
.
My
father
took
his
hat
and
scarf
and
walked
down
to
the
docks
.
There
were
men
there
he
knew
,
idle
like
him
,
and
they
envied
him
his
money
and
although
he
was
not
stupid
enough
to
envy
them
their
poverty
,
there
was
part
of
him
that
regretted
all
he
had
done
.
They
drank
together
.
He
drank
alone
.
He
wanted
to
go
with
them
to
the
filthy
Admiral
Arms
but
what
right
had
he
to
sit
in
his
cups
when
they
would
be
going
home
to
cheap
rations
and
unpaid
bills
?
He
desperately
wanted
to
say
,
'
I
am
unhappy
.
'
How
could
he
say
that
to
them
?
'
Is
it
a
funeral
?
'
I
asked
my
mother
.
On
the
sixth
day
of
his
absence
my
mother
appeared
in
the
dining
room
,
in
her
mink
coat
,
carrying
a
small
suitcase
.
The
three
of
us
were
doing
a
jigsaw
while
the
inadequate
fire
tried
to
melt
the
icicles
that
were
hanging
in
long
spears
around
the
room
.
'
I
have
to
go
to
your
father
,
'
she
said
and
kissed
us
with
her
cold
red
mouth
.
'
Grandmother
will
be
here
.
'
Her
stocking
seams
were
straight
,
her
hair
was
curled
,
her
back
was
upright
,
her
waist
was
curved
,
her
legs
were
long
,
her
breasts
round
,
her
stomach
was
flat
,
her
bottom
was
not
.
Black
hair
,
blue
eyes
,
red
mouth
,
pale
skin
,
and
all
this
packed
as
neatly
as
picnic
Tupperware
.
There
was
nothing
of
the
whore
about
her
and
this
my
father
liked
.
For
the
first
time
in
months
I
felt
my
body
slacken
.
I
had
been
carrying
myself
like
a
gun
,
cocked
,
alert
,
ready
for
trouble
,
fearing
it
.
My
parents
were
rowing
and
when
they
were
n't
rowing
they
were
snapping
and
when
they
were
n't
snapping
they
were
planning
a
party
,
holding
a
party
,
cleaning
up
after
a
party
.
Here
,
shovelling
human
compost
out
of
my
grandmother
's
cloaca
,
I
was
happy
again
.
We
stacked
the
rich
mould
around
her
roses
and
she
sang
me
ballads
from
the
docks
,
easing
her
voice
with
regular
swigs
from
an
unmarked
tin-billy
.
'
Grog-blossom
,
'
she
said
tapping
her
nose
the
colour
of
the
roses
.
The
wind
was
warm
,
trade
wind
with
generosity
and
travel
in
it
,
a
wind
to
scatter
the
ships
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
although
my
father
was
too
young
for
ships
with
sails
,
like
other
water-men
,
the
wind
still
excited
him
.
A
fair
find
.
A
new
world
.
The
recklessness
of
the
sailor
that
my
father
loved
.
It
was
inevitable
that
the
air
should
fight
its
war
with
the
sea
.
Cargo
and
passengers
alike
preferred
to
fly
and
as
shipping
costs
increased
air
prices
dropped
.
My
father
's
company
,
man
and
boy
,
was
suffering
unsustainable
losses
.
Trident
Shipping
,
funded
1809
,
was
slowly
going
bankrupt
and
taking
my
father
with
it
.
He
worked
for
a
shipping
company
and
had
done
so
since
he
was
fifteen
.
He
had
started
at
the
end
of
the
war
as
an
office
boy
and
fourteen
years
later
was
to
be
made
a
director
of
the
line
.
To
celebrate
he
made
love
to
my
mother
and
I
was
conceived
.
I
helped
Grandmother
unpack
her
things
;
a
week
's
supply
of
kippers
and
her
Bible
.
I
opened
it
at
the
marker
and
found
that
we
were
back
at
the
Book
of
Job
.
This
meant
my
grandmother
was
in
tribulation
,
though
on
this
occasion
her
tribulation
had
a
kind
of
glittering
intensity
about
it
that
heated
the
indifferent
house
and
made
us
excited
again
.
Very
often
she
said
,
'
The
horse
that
crieth
among
the
trumpets
Aha
!
'
and
I
wondered
what
kind
of
a
horse
it
was
that
would
do
that
.
Undeterred
,
we
imitated
him
and
soon
the
zero
house
was
filled
with
smells
and
smoke
and
voices
crying
Aha
!
I
said
,
'
If
we
were
good
always
would
we
be
happy
always
?
'
It
would
have
been
better
if
I
had
been
made
of
nylon
;
easier
then
to
soak
out
the
miseries
that
were
soaking
in
.
These
were
his
happiest
times
,
the
times
when
his
paperwork
was
done
,
when
he
could
hear
his
secretary
rattling
at
the
upright
Remington
as
though
it
were
a
church
piano
.
He
worked
evenings
and
early
mornings
so
that
he
could
make
a
gap
to
slip
through
,
a
private
space
after
coffee
and
before
lunch
,
when
the
piers
were
busy
with
every
kind
of
activity
,
legitimate
and
not
.
She
did
teach
me
and
we
did
not
tell
my
mother
or
my
father
about
the
privy
or
the
scones
or
the
dancing
lessons
or
the
unnamed
grog
or
the
teenage
turntable
in
its
vinyl
zip
case
or
the
happiness
that
was
unhygienic
or
the
sense
of
peace
that
had
the
smell
of
buttered
kippers
.
He
had
booked
his
old
room
and
even
packed
a
tie
he
used
to
wear
in
those
days
.
Red
silk
with
little
white
polka
dots
,
he
never
would
say
who
had
given
it
to
him
.
'
Never
tell
all
thy
love
.
'
My
father
swung
us
up
in
his
arms
and
laughed
and
said
we
were
going
on
an
adventure
.
'
I
'm
quite
sure
that
it
will
be
at
least
a
week
before
the
birth
,
'
said
my
mother
who
immediately
went
into
labour
.
The
glittering
fish
were
stars
.
My
father
had
heard
that
Cunard
,
the
most
illustrious
and
prestigious
shipping
line
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
was
to
be
bought
up
by
Trafalgar
House
Investments
.
Cunard
had
recently
taken
delivery
of
their
new
flagship
,
the
QE2
,
and
were
making
money
on
her
.
My
father
had
been
to
the
launch
party
in
Southampton
and
met
a
few
men
he
liked
and
who
had
liked
him
.
Two
of
them
had
been
to
one
of
his
foie
gras
parties
.
One
of
them
had
suggested
he
might
consider
a
key
role
in
the
reorganisation
of
the
Cunard
enterprise
,
with
particular
responsibility
for
the
QE2
's
Atlantic
crossings
.
For
my
father
it
seemed
like
the
dream
again
,
youth
again
,
just
married
again
,
a
place
where
the
sea
was
still
alive
and
where
he
too
would
be
alive
.
Cunard
's
headquarters
were
in
London
and
in
a
matter
of
weeks
so
were
we
.
She
did
n't
answer
.
She
was
looking
back
down
the
road
.
Suddenly
she
picked
me
up
and
shot
a
full
pelt
back
to
our
car
.
I
did
n't
know
my
mother
could
run
.
I
had
never
seen
her
run
.
She
threw
me
in
the
back
seat
and
flung
herself
in
after
me
in
a
whirl
of
Dior
and
hairpins
.

The
idea
,
his
idea
,
was
a
three-day
cruise
to
chase
the
comet
Kohoutek
,
named
after
the
Czech
astronomer
who
had
discovered
it
.
It
was
expected
to
be
one
of
the
brightest
comets
of
the
twentieth
century
,
and
in
some
ways
the
cruise
was
the
beginning
of
millennium
fever
.
Religion
may
lose
its
appeal
but
portents
are
popular
.
The
sell-out
cruise
,
itself
something
of
a
foie
gras
,
was
packed
with
atheists
looking
for
mystery
.
Unfortunately
the
weather
was
so
bad
that
most
of
the
adults
found
their
best
visions
in
a
champagne
bottle
.
My
father
was
very
busy
and
I
was
left
alone
.
In
1947
,
certificated
and
handsome
at
eighteen
,
he
was
given
a
lowly
job-with-prospects
at
Trident
Shipping
(
Progress
,
Tradition
,
Integrity
)
.
All
of
his
family
had
worn
clean
clothes
to
work
,
that
was
their
pride
,
but
none
had
ever
worn
clean
clothes
home
.
For
them
it
had
been
mother
with
a
boiling
hip-bath
and
a
packet
of
soap
flakes
.
My
father
went
to
work
clean
and
he
came
home
clean
.
This
was
an
endless
source
of
satisfaction
to
my
grandmother
who
never
lost
her
own
whiff
of
elbow
grease
but
delighted
in
the
sweet
smell
of
success
.
She
had
a
long
stride
though
I
was
taller
.
Soon
we
were
at
the
Battery
.
Legend
has
it
that
the
Ship
,
while
seeking
the
Holy
Grail
,
sailed
off
the
end
of
the
world
and
continued
forever
.
At
particular
conjunctions
of
time
and
timelessness
,
it
appears
again
as
a
bright
light
,
shooting
its
course
through
the
unfathomable
universe
,
chasing
that
which
has
neither
beginning
nor
end
.
Sighing
,
he
threw
down
his
cigarette
and
went
inside
,
straightening
his
tie
.
He
listened
briefly
.
'
Yes
,
yes
.
'
Then
he
threw
down
the
receiver
and
threw
his
secretary
up
into
the
air
.
For
myself
,
in
the
dark
,
watching
the
thin
silver
line
speed
away
,
I
had
joined
that
band
of
pilgrims
uncenturied
,
unquantified
,
who
,
call
it
art
,
call
it
alchemy
,
call
it
science
,
call
it
god
,
are
driven
by
a
light
that
will
not
stay
.
The
Godspeed
.
My
father
at
the
wheel
.
My
mother
on
a
hard
couch
giving
birth
to
me
.
My
mother
lay
with
her
skirts
up
over
her
face
,
her
perfect
stockings
round
her
ankles
,
her
pain
groaning
against
the
heavy
noise
of
the
engine
.
SHE
:
Women
as
well
?
ME
:
No
.
While
she
was
talking
I
wondered
why
Jove
wanted
me
.
I
had
come
out
dressed
to
kill
and
I
was
the
one
being
murdered
.
My
self-esteem
is
a
jigsaw
I
can
not
complete
.
I
get
one
part
of
the
picture
and
the
rest
lies
in
pieces
.
I
suspect
that
there
is
no
picture
,
only
fragments
.
Other
people
seem
to
glue
it
together
somehow
and
not
to
worry
that
they
have
been
using
pieces
from
several
different
boxes
.
So
what
is
the
answer
?
Is
identity
a
deceit
,
a
make-shift
,
and
should
we
hurry
to
make
any
pattern
we
can
?
Or
is
there
a
coherence
,
perhaps
a
beauty
,
if
it
were
possible
to
find
it
?
I
would
like
to
convince
myself
about
myself
but
I
can
not
.
The
best
there
is
are
days
when
the
jigsaw
assumes
its
own
meaning
and
I
no
longer
care
what
picture
is
emerging
.
By
that
I
mean
I
am
unfrightened
by
the
unexpected
.
If
there
is
beauty
it
will
surprise
me
.
Of
all
things
it
can
not
be
calculated
.
I
said
I
suspect
that
there
is
no
picture
.
I
should
have
said
that
whatever
the
picture
is
,
it
will
not
be
the
one
on
the
box
.
He
lit
every
one
of
his
distress
flares
and
burnt
up
the
river
in
a
blaze
of
phosphorous
red
.
Every
tug
and
patrol
boat
on
the
stretch
surrounded
us
,
but
far
from
sinking
we
were
celebrating
.
My
grandmother
called
it
the
Miracle
of
the
Sardines
and
the
Gin
.
She
had
only
fetched
enough
for
herself
but
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
for
everyone
and
so
I
was
born
,
in
dirt
,
in
delight
,
in
water
and
in
spirits
,
with
fish
above
and
below
and
under
an
exacting
star
.
I
met
Stella
at
the
Algonquin
Hotel
.
The
Algonquin
Hotel
;
Dorothy
Parker
,
James
Thurber
,
The
New
Yorker
,
my
father
in
1957
.
He
had
stayed
there
because
it
seemed
so
English
and
when
he
brought
me
to
New
York
for
the
first
time
as
a
child
our
reservations
were
at
the
Algonquin
Hotel
.
My
grandmother
loved
me
because
she
recognised
the
same
stubbornness
that
she
had
gened
in
her
son
.
The
difficulty
and
the
dream
were
not
separate
.
To
pan
the
living
clay
that
you
are
is
to
stand
in
the
freezing
waters
and
break
yourself
on
a
riddle
of
your
own
making
.
No
one
can
force
you
to
it
.
No
one
can
force
you
away
.
Rhinegold
,
pure
gold
and
somewhere
in
the
Rhinegold
,
the
ring
.
Later
,
much
later
when
I
heard
Wagner
's
Ring
cycle
I
thought
of
the
times
when
I
had
been
a
very
little
child
and
my
father
had
taken
me
to
watch
the
sunset
on
the
estuary
.
He
loved
the
gold
light
dabbling
the
water
.
His
mind
played
in
it
.
He
and
his
images
were
still
free
but
then
the
moving
gold
hardened
around
him
and
he
began
to
count
it
.
The
stories
agree
that
in
the
difficulty
and
the
dream
the
hero
should
never
count
the
cost
.
On
my
sixth
birthday
the
parties
started
.
I
had
a
cake
,
presents
,
a
new
frock
.
The
adults
had
what
my
father
called
a
'
foie
gras
'
.
How
much
can
you
eat
and
drink
without
vomiting
over
the
coffee
table
?
Mother
said
:
'
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
?
'
His
was
the
night
vessel
,
the
vessel
on
oily
waters
,
his
was
the
light
shining
in
the
darkness
,
come
home
,
come
home
.
On
the
night
of
my
birth
my
father
got
the
madness
on
him
and
told
my
mother
he
had
to
go
tugging
.
'
I
'll
come
with
you
,
'
she
said
.
'
I
feel
well
.
'
At
the
same
time
I
realised
the
absurdity
of
pinning
anything
onto
a
kiss
.
Deeper
now
where
the
water
is
not
clear
.
What
patterns
do
the
numbers
make
?
One
plus
one
is
not
necessarily
two
.
I
do
the
sum
and
the
answer
is
an
incipient
third
.
Three
pairs
of
two
:
Jove
and
Stella
,
Jove
and
Alice
,
Alice
and
Stella
and
under
the
surface
of
each
the
head
of
the
other
.
I
sniffed
the
bottles
.
Here
were
the
secrets
of
irresistible
skin
and
salt
smells
of
pearl
and
oyster
.
Not
here
the
floral
notes
of
the
high-octave
female
.
I
admire
the
soprano
singer
but
not
the
soprano
speaker
.
High
voices
like
high
heels
are
a
put-on
.
Unfortunately
only
the
shoes
get
kicked
off
at
night
.
I
had
dressed
as
a
warrior
:
black
from
cleavage
to
insoles
,
hair
down
,
fat
hoops
of
gold
in
my
ears
,
war-paint
make-up
.
I
had
a
twenty-year
advantage
over
my
opponent
and
I
intended
to
use
every
month
of
it
.
'
What
have
I
made
of
my
life
?
'
'
He
was
a
flirt
even
then
,
'
said
Stella
.
'
He
flirted
with
Mama
who
had
a
weakness
for
dark
hair
and
dark
eyes
,
even
in
a
sevenyear-old
boy
.
'
Of
course
she
had
not
come
.
Of
course
she
would
not
come
.
It
had
been
a
nerve
war
and
I
had
won
.
I
noticed
I
had
a
terrible
pain
in
my
neck
.
I
ordered
a
drink
and
collapsed
under
a
potted
palm
.
'
May
I
sit
here
?
'
'
Please
do
.
You
must
be
English
.
'
'
Why
?
'
There
was
a
terrific
rattling
and
thundering
at
the
door
and
my
mother
and
father
burst
into
the
hall
;
she
in
a
silver
fox
,
he
in
a
new
overcoat
and
trilby
.
Behind
them
,
a
taxi-driver
struggled
up
the
steps
with
a
pile
of
boxes
.
The
little
boy
had
been
asleep
and
through
his
dreams
came
a
sleigh
piled
with
furs
and
followed
on
foot
by
a
band
of
wild
dark
men
,
huddled
hurrying
,
talking
in
a
language
he
did
not
understand
.
He
heard
barking
and
crying
and
from
below
the
protesting
water
being
drawn
along
the
frozen
pipes
and
into
the
geyser
.
He
woke
up
and
ran
downstairs
.
The
chairs
and
tables
had
been
pushed
back
against
the
walls
and
the
double
doors
onto
the
street
were
open
.
Through
the
blue
curtain
of
cold
,
into
the
orange
lights
,
six
wolves
drew
a
sledge
.
The
leading
pair
pulled
up
two
inches
from
his
chest
and
level
with
it
.
One
of
the
wolves
licked
his
face
with
its
brown-pink
parma
ham
tongue
.
Now
he
would
be
eaten
.
They
had
begun
with
Genesis
and
were
now
at
the
Book
of
Job
,
with
whose
trials
my
grandmother
sympathised
,
especially
since
she
had
recently
developed
a
boil
.
'
Are
n't
Americans
polite
?
'
'
Only
if
you
pay
them
enough
.
'
'
The
British
are
n't
polite
no
matter
how
much
you
pay
them
.
'
'
Then
you
and
I
must
be
refugees
.
'
As
she
read
'
Who
will
avail
me
in
my
tribulation
?
'
the
door
flew
open
and
my
father
reached
down
into
the
bath
and
scooped
out
my
mother
whole
and
carried
her
off
into
the
bedroom
.
Gut
symmetries
My
father
had
told
me
about
the
remoras
and
how
the
Greek
fishermen
in
the
little
boats
still
fear
him
.
My
father
feared
no
remoras
.
We
were
quiet
.
She
was
looking
towards
the
door
.
I
looked
at
her
.
She
was
slim
,
wired
,
a
greyhound
body
,
half
bent
forward
now
,
shape
of
her
back
muscles
contouring
her
shirt
,
white
,
starched
,
expensive
.
Her
left
arm
looked
like
the
front
window
of
Tiffany
's
.
I
was
not
sure
how
a
woman
could
wear
so
much
silver
and
sit
without
a
lean
.
Her
hair
was
dark
red
,
dogwood
red
,
leather
red
with
a
suppleness
to
it
that
is
part
gift
,
part
effort
.
I
guessed
that
the
look
of
hers
was
as
artful
as
it
was
artless
.
'
David
sha
n't
like
it
,
'
she
said
.
She
gathered
her
things
and
together
we
left
the
destroyed
room
.
I
had
to
follow
her
as
she
twisted
the
pavements
under
her
feet
.
I
lost
sense
of
where
we
were
.
The
grid
had
buckled
.
The
city
was
a
bent
alley
and
she
was
the
better
rat
.
'
Then
I
shall
be
bad
.
'
In
1957
he
married
my
mother
.
She
was
Irish
,
nearly
well-to-do
,
the
daughter
of
a
partner
in
the
firm
who
was
based
in
Cork
.
My
father
had
seen
her
at
the
Annual
Dinner
and
Dance
and
vowed
that
he
would
marry
her
.
For
two
years
they
exchanged
letters
and
gifts
until
romance
,
persistence
and
a
promotion
won
the
day
.
On
their
wedding
night
,
at
the
Hotel
Ra-Ra
(
décor
:
Merseyside-Egypt
)
,
my
father
took
off
his
pyjamas
so
that
his
wife
could
see
him
man
qua
man
,
then
told
her
that
he
would
not
make
love
to
her
until
he
had
been
made
a
director
of
the
line
.
He
put
on
his
pyjamas
again
and
after
a
moment
or
two
of
violent
shuddering
,
fell
asleep
.
She
took
me
home
,
did
n't
put
on
any
lights
,
took
off
her
clothes
and
had
me
lie
down
beside
her
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
narrow
bed
.
I
wanted
to
touch
her
.
The
reflecting
image
of
a
woman
with
a
woman
is
seductive
.
I
enjoyed
looking
at
her
in
a
way
that
was
forbidden
to
me
,
this
self
on
self
,
self
as
desirer
and
desired
,
had
a
frankness
to
it
I
had
not
been
invited
to
discover
.
Desiring
her
I
felt
my
own
desirability
.
It
was
an
act
of
power
but
not
power
over
her
.
I
was
my
own
conquest
.
There
was
a
wind
in
the
room
that
tore
the
drink
out
of
the
drinkers
,
that
scattered
the
bar
bottles
like
bottle
tops
,
that
levitated
the
furniture
and
smashed
it
into
the
tranced
wall
.
Waiters
and
waited
on
blew
in
rags
out
of
the
door
.
There
was
nothing
left
in
the
room
but
she
and
me
,
she
and
me
hypnotised
by
each
other
,
unable
to
speak
because
of
the
wind
.
She
looked
at
her
watch
.
'
Are
you
staying
here
?
'
'
No
.
I
live
in
New
York
.
I
work
at
the
Institute
for
Advanced
Studies
.
I
came
here
to
meet
...
'
The
legend
says
that
Zeus
lusted
after
a
Titan
called
Metis
and
eventually
got
her
with
a
child
.
An
oracle
told
Zeus
that
the
baby
would
be
a
girl
but
that
if
Metis
ever
conceived
again
,
she
would
wear
a
boy
who
would
overthrough
Zeus
,
just
as
Zeus
had
deposed
his
own
father
,
Kronos
.
In
fear
,
Zeus
stroked
and
flattered
Metis
until
she
came
close
enough
to
kiss
him
of
her
own
free
will
.
He
swallowed
her
.
'
I
'll
teach
you
,
'
she
said
.
When
the
hours
were
golden
and
green
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
house
levitated
.
My
father
pleased
with
his
work
,
my
mother
pleased
with
her
home
and
her
children
.
I
do
n't
remember
the
exact
moment
of
the
eclipse
,
only
a
gradual
chilliness
and
the
golden
light
paling
yellow-pale-yellow-yellow
to
fade
.
I
do
remember
that
my
father
felt
cheated
.
His
salary
was
insufficient
,
his
bonus
was
insufficient
,
his
challenges
were
puny
,
his
achievements
were
not
fully
recognised
.
He
said
those
things
to
my
mother
,
I
heard
them
,
but
to
me
he
said
,
by
the
sun-dial
,
'
I
'm
forty-one
and
the
sea
is
dying
.
'
He
ran
his
finger
back
and
forth
over
the
hooded
Time
.
When
he
arrived
home
my
mother
was
not
expecting
him
.
His
secretary
had
not
made
the
instructed
call
.
Mother
was
in
the
bath
,
with
bubbles
up
to
her
neck
,
and
my
grandmother
,
on
the
bath-stool
,
was
reading
out
loud
from
the
Bible
.
This
was
their
regular
Sunday
visiting
hour
,
and
having
little
in
common
and
less
to
say
,
they
had
hit
on
the
happy
idea
of
spiritual
elevation
.
My
mother
never
listened
to
what
my
grandmother
read
,
but
she
felt
she
was
doing
her
duty
by
her
family
and
by
God
,
and
it
saved
her
the
trouble
of
going
to
church
.
My
grandmother
,
who
was
firmly
convinced
by
the
Word
of
the
Lord
,
took
more
pleasure
in
that
hour
than
in
any
other
of
the
week
,
including
2
p.m.
Thursday
when
she
drew
her
pension
.
As
she
told
the
story
she
forgot
about
me
.
I
had
begun
as
an
adversary
,
become
an
audience
,
and
now
seemed
only
a
footlight
.
The
stage
was
hers
and
if
she
was
performing
for
anyone
it
was
herself
.
A
very
good
performer
she
was
;
breaking
into
Yiddish
,
into
Italian
,
into
German
,
accenting
and
gesturing
,
turning
now
into
a
claque
of
elderly
Jews
,
now
into
a
frightened
small
boy
.
I
had
to
let
go
of
my
detachment
,
my
resentment
.
When
she
imitated
the
horse
that
crieth
among
the
trumpets
'
Aha
!
'
,
I
was
back
with
Grandmother
again
,
back
with
the
weekly
visits
and
the
preposterous
slippers
,
the
huge
full-length
apron
,
its
pocket
stuffed
with
Polo
mints
and
a
battered
Bible
.
'
Yet
,
'
said
the
Oilskin
.
No
sign
of
her
.
The
bar
was
a
chessboard
of
couples
manoeuvring
Martinis
and
waiters
high-carrying
chrome
trays
.
I
moved
in
black
knight
right
angles
across
and
cross
the
lines
but
apart
from
a
few
appreciative
businessmen
there
was
no
one
who
seemed
interested
in
me
.
He
would
not
sodomise
his
own
wife
.
Instead
he
went
to
New
York
.
As
his
world
darkened
,
the
shadows
in
our
house
increased
.

Resumption
of
the
session
.
I
declare
resumed
the
session
of
the
European
Parliament
adjourned
on
Friday
17
December
1999
,
and
I
would
like
once
again
to
wish
you
a
happy
new
year
in
the
hope
that
you
enjoyed
a
pleasant
festive
period
.
In
the
meantime
,
I
should
like
to
observe
a
minute
's
silence
,
as
a
number
of
Members
have
requested
,
on
behalf
of
all
the
victims
concerned
,
particularly
those
of
the
terrible
storms
,
in
the
various
countries
of
the
European
Union
.
Please
rise
,
then
,
for
this
minute
's
silence
.
(
The
House
rose
and
observed
a
minute
's
silence
)
.
Madam
President
,
on
a
point
of
order
.
You
will
be
aware
from
the
press
and
television
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
bomb
explosions
and
killings
in
Sri
Lanka
.
One
of
the
people
assassinated
very
recently
in
Sri
Lanka
was
Mr
Kumar
Ponnambalam
,
who
had
visited
the
European
Parliament
just
a
few
months
ago
.
Would
it
be
appropriate
for
you
,
Madam
President
,
to
write
a
letter
to
the
Sri
Lankan
President
expressing
Parliament
's
regret
at
his
and
the
other
violent
deaths
in
Sri
Lanka
and
urging
her
to
do
everything
she
possibly
can
to
seek
a
peaceful
reconciliation
to
a
very
difficult
situation
?
If
the
House
agrees
,
I
shall
do
as
Mr
Evans
has
suggested
.
Madam
President
,
on
a
point
of
order
.
I
would
like
your
advice
about
Rule
143
concerning
inadmissibility
.
My
question
relates
to
something
that
will
come
up
on
Thursday
and
which
I
will
then
raise
again
.
I
believe
that
the
principle
of
relative
stability
is
a
fundamental
legal
principle
of
the
common
fisheries
policy
and
a
proposal
to
subvert
it
would
be
legally
inadmissible
.
I
want
to
know
whether
one
can
raise
an
objection
of
that
kind
to
what
is
merely
a
report
,
not
a
legislative
proposal
,
and
whether
that
is
something
I
can
competently
do
on
Thursday
.
that
is
precisely
the
time
when
you
may
,
if
you
wish
,
raise
this
question
,
i.e.
on
Thursday
prior
to
the
start
of
the
presentation
of
the
report
.
Madam
President
,
coinciding
with
this
year
's
first
part
-
session
of
the
European
Parliament
,
a
date
has
been
set
,
unfortunately
for
next
Thursday
,
in
Texas
in
America
,
for
the
execution
of
a
young
34
year
-
old
man
who
has
been
sentenced
to
death
.
However
,
I
would
ask
you
,
in
accordance
with
the
line
which
is
now
constantly
followed
by
the
European
Parliament
and
by
the
whole
of
the
European
Community
,
to
make
representations
,
using
the
weight
of
your
prestigious
office
and
the
institution
you
represent
,
to
the
President
and
to
the
Governor
of
Texas
,
Mr
Bush
,
who
has
the
power
to
order
a
stay
of
execution
and
to
reprieve
the
condemned
person
.
This
is
all
in
accordance
with
the
principles
that
we
have
always
upheld
.
Thank
you
,
Mr
Segni
,
I
shall
do
so
gladly
.
Indeed
,
it
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
positions
this
House
has
always
adopted
.
Madam
President
,
I
should
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
a
case
in
which
this
Parliament
has
consistently
shown
an
interest
.
All
of
us
here
are
pleased
that
the
courts
have
acquitted
him
and
made
it
clear
that
in
Russia
,
too
,
access
to
environmental
information
is
a
constitutional
right
.
Now
,
however
,
he
is
to
go
before
the
courts
once
more
because
the
public
prosecutor
is
appealing
.
We
know
,
and
we
have
stated
as
much
in
very
many
resolutions
indeed
,
including
specifically
during
the
last
plenary
part
-
session
of
last
year
,
that
this
is
not
solely
a
legal
case
and
that
it
is
wrong
for
Alexander
Nikitin
to
be
accused
of
criminal
activity
and
treason
because
of
our
involvement
as
the
beneficiaries
of
his
findings
.
These
findings
form
the
basis
of
the
European
programmes
to
protect
the
Barents
Sea
,
and
that
is
why
I
would
ask
you
to
examine
a
draft
letter
setting
out
the
most
important
facts
and
to
make
Parliament
's
position
,
as
expressed
in
the
resolutions
which
it
has
adopted
,
clear
as
far
as
Russia
is
concerned
.
Yes
,
Mrs
Schroedter
,
I
shall
be
pleased
to
look
into
the
facts
of
this
case
when
I
have
received
your
letter
.
Madam
President
,
I
would
firstly
like
to
compliment
you
on
the
fact
that
you
have
kept
your
word
and
that
,
during
this
first
part
-
session
of
the
new
year
,
the
number
of
television
channels
in
our
offices
has
indeed
increased
considerably
.
But
,
Madam
President
,
my
personal
request
has
not
been
met
.
I
would
therefore
once
more
ask
you
to
ensure
that
we
get
a
Dutch
channel
as
well
.
Mrs
Plooij
-
Van
Gorsel
,
I
can
tell
you
that
this
matter
is
on
the
agenda
for
the
Quaestors
'
meeting
on
Wednesday
.
It
will
,
I
hope
,
be
examined
in
a
positive
light
.
Madam
President
,
can
you
tell
me
why
this
Parliament
does
not
adhere
to
the
health
and
safety
legislation
that
it
actually
passes
?
Why
has
no
air
quality
test
been
done
on
this
particular
building
since
we
were
elected
?
Why
has
there
been
no
Health
and
Safety
Committee
meeting
since
1998
?
Why
has
there
been
no
fire
drill
,
either
in
the
Brussels
Parliament
buildings
or
the
Strasbourg
Parliament
buildings
?
Why
are
there
no
fire
instructions
?
Why
have
the
staircases
not
been
improved
since
my
accident
?
Why
are
no
-
smoking
areas
not
enforced
?
Mrs
Lynne
,
you
are
quite
right
and
I
shall
check
whether
this
has
actually
not
been
done
.
I
shall
also
refer
the
matter
to
the
College
of
Quaestors
,
and
I
am
certain
that
they
will
be
keen
to
ensure
that
we
comply
with
the
regulations
we
ourselves
vote
on
.
Madam
President
,
Mrs
Díez
González
and
I
had
tabled
questions
on
certain
opinions
of
the
Vice
-
President
,
Mrs
De
Palacio
,
which
appeared
in
a
Spanish
newspaper
.
The
competent
services
have
not
included
them
in
the
agenda
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
been
answered
in
a
previous
part
-
session
.
The
questions
answered
previously
referred
to
Mrs
De
Palacio
's
intervention
,
on
another
occasion
,
and
not
to
these
comments
which
appeared
in
the
Abc
newspaper
on
18
November
.
I
admit
that
,
at
present
,
the
matter
seems
to
be
somewhat
confused
.
We
shall
therefore
look
into
it
properly
to
ensure
that
everything
is
as
it
should
be
.
Madam
President
,
I
should
like
to
know
if
there
will
be
a
clear
message
going
out
from
Parliament
this
week
about
our
discontent
over
today
's
decision
refusing
to
renew
the
arms
embargo
on
Indonesia
,
considering
that
the
vast
majority
in
this
Parliament
have
endorsed
the
arms
embargo
in
Indonesia
in
the
past
?
Today
's
decision
not
to
renew
the
embargo
is
extremely
dangerous
considering
the
situation
there
.
So
Parliament
should
send
a
message
,
since
that
is
the
wish
of
the
vast
majority
.
It
is
irresponsible
of
EU
Member
States
to
refuse
to
renew
the
embargo
.
As
people
have
said
,
the
situation
there
is
extremely
volatile
.
We
do
not
know
what
is
happening
.
In
any
event
,
this
question
is
not
presently
included
among
the
requests
for
topical
and
urgent
debate
on
Thursday
.
Madam
President
,
the
presentation
of
the
Prodi
Commission
's
political
programme
for
the
whole
legislature
was
initially
a
proposal
by
the
Group
of
the
Party
of
European
Socialists
which
was
unanimously
approved
by
the
Conference
of
Presidents
in
September
and
which
was
also
explicitly
accepted
by
President
Prodi
,
who
reiterated
his
commitment
in
his
inaugural
speech
.
This
commitment
is
important
because
the
Commission
is
a
body
with
a
monopoly
of
initiative
in
accordance
with
the
Treaties
and
,
therefore
,
basically
dictates
this
Parliament
's
political
and
legislative
activity
for
the
next
five
years
.
I
would
also
like
to
point
out
,
Madam
President
,
that
this
Parliament
voted
to
express
its
confidence
in
President
Prodi
during
the
previous
legislature
.
It
did
so
again
during
this
legislature
,
in
July
,
and
then
,
in
September
,
it
voted
once
more
to
approve
the
whole
Commission
.
There
has
therefore
been
enough
time
for
the
Commission
to
prepare
its
programme
and
for
us
to
become
familiar
with
it
and
explain
it
to
our
citizens
.
To
this
end
,
I
would
like
to
remind
you
of
the
resolution
of
15
September
,
which
recommended
that
the
proposal
be
presented
as
soon
as
possible
.
The
events
of
last
week
-
which
originated
outside
the
Conference
of
Presidents
,
that
Conference
being
used
simply
to
corroborate
and
ratify
decisions
taken
elsewhere
-
present
us
with
a
dilemma
.
According
to
its
President
,
it
is
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
My
Group
believes
that
since
a
Parliament
is
meant
to
listen
,
debate
and
reflect
,
there
can
be
no
justification
whatsoever
for
this
delay
and
we
believe
that
,
if
the
Commission
is
ready
to
do
so
,
we
still
have
time
to
re-establish
the
original
agreement
between
Parliament
and
the
Commission
and
proceed
in
a
manner
which
fulfils
our
duty
to
our
fellow
citizens
.
on
the
pretext
that
there
is
no
text
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
President
of
the
Commission
would
be
denied
his
right
to
speak
in
this
Parliament
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
would
be
a
debate
on
a
reform
when
Parliament
had
no
prior
knowledge
of
the
texts
on
which
it
is
based
.
Therefore
,
Madam
President
,
I
would
ask
you
to
request
that
the
Commission
express
its
opinion
on
this
issue
and
that
we
then
proceed
to
the
vote
.
(
Applause
from
the
PSE
Group
)
.
I
was
told
that
large
sections
of
the
Socialist
Group
were
also
keen
to
have
this
item
taken
off
the
agenda
,
because
at
the
vote
in
the
Conference
of
Presidents
no
vote
was
received
from
the
working
group
of
Members
of
the
Socialist
Group
responsible
for
this
matter
.
I
do
not
know
whether
this
information
is
correct
,
but
the
PPE
-
DE
Group
would
,
in
any
case
,
be
grateful
if
this
item
were
removed
because
Parliament
has
addressed
this
issue
several
times
already
.
Decisions
have
also
been
adopted
against
a
tax
of
this
kind
.
That
is
why
my
Group
moves
that
this
item
be
taken
off
the
agenda
.
Thank
you
,
Mr
Poettering
.
We
shall
now
hear
Mr
Wurtz
speaking
against
this
request
.
Madam
President
,
I
would
firstly
like
to
point
out
Mr
Poettering
's
lack
of
logic
.
It
is
not
a
lot
to
ask
.
We
shall
proceed
to
vote
on
the
PPE
-
DE
Group
's
request
that
the
oral
question
regarding
the
capital
tax
be
withdrawn
from
the
agenda
.
(
Parliament
rejected
the
request
,
with
164
votes
for
,
166
votes
against
and
7
abstentions
)
.
Madam
President
,
I
would
like
to
thank
Mr
Poettering
for
advertising
this
debate
.
Thank
you
very
much
.
My
vote
was
"
in
favour
"
.
Madam
President
,
the
Presidency
has
already
declared
the
result
of
the
vote
.
There
is
no
room
for
amendments
.
Madam
President
,
in
the
earlier
vote
-
and
I
will
abide
by
your
ruling
on
this
matter
-
on
the
question
of
the
strategic
plan
of
the
Commission
I
indicated
that
I
would
like
to
speak
in
advance
of
the
vote
on
behalf
of
my
Group
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
,
on
the
close
of
this
item
of
business
,
I
might
be
allowed
to
give
an
explanation
of
vote
on
behalf
of
my
Group
.
This
is
an
important
matter
.
Madam
President
,
I
do
not
wish
to
reopen
the
debate
,
but
I
had
also
asked
for
the
floor
,
to
comment
on
Mr
Barón
Crespo
's
motion
.
You
did
not
call
me
either
.
I
regret
this
,
but
the
vote
has
already
been
taken
and
the
decision
is
made
so
let
us
leave
the
matter
there
.
Even
so
,
I
think
the
positions
are
quite
clear
and
they
shall
be
entered
in
the
Minutes
.
When
we
adopt
the
Minutes
for
today
's
sitting
tomorrow
,
then
any
Members
who
think
the
positions
have
not
been
explained
clearly
enough
may
ask
for
amendments
.
This
seems
to
me
to
be
a
workable
solution
.
Of
course
,
the
Minutes
for
tomorrow
's
sitting
will
take
into
account
any
additional
explanations
.
I
think
this
is
a
better
solution
than
proceeding
now
to
extremely
time-consuming
explanations
of
votes
.
Mr
Cox
,
Mr
Hänsch
,
would
this
be
acceptable
to
you
?
Madam
President
,
if
the
vote
records
correctly
how
my
Group
voted
I
shall
not
,
and
cannot
,
object
to
that
.
If
your
ruling
is
that
I
cannot
give
an
explanation
of
vote
,
I
accept
that
but
accept
with
reservations
.
If
they
do
not
properly
reflect
the
positions
adopted
,
then
we
may
correct
them
,
if
necessary
.
(
The
order
of
business
was
adopted
thus
amended
)
.
Madam
President
,
we
cannot
and
must
not
accept
the
fact
that
we
hear
ever
more
frequently
of
accidents
causing
major
damage
on
our
roads
,
but
also
on
our
railways
and
waterways
,
not
solely
but
at
least
partly
because
those
involved
do
not
take
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
seriously
enough
or
because
-
as
a
result
of
ignorance
or
a
lack
of
training
on
the
part
of
the
drivers
or
others
responsible
for
the
various
vehicles
-
a
minor
accident
has
all
too
often
become
a
major
disaster
.
As
an
Austrian
,
I
still
have
a
vivid
memory
,
as
,
I
believe
,
we
all
do
,
of
the
catastrophe
which
cost
so
many
human
lives
last
year
in
the
Tauern
Tunnel
,
where
subsequent
work
to
rebuild
the
parts
of
the
tunnel
which
had
been
destroyed
in
this
fire
continued
for
many
months
at
huge
expense
.
The
renovation
project
,
which
lasted
for
months
,
cut
off
this
important
route
between
the
north
and
south
of
Europe
.
The
traffic
which
had
to
be
diverted
because
of
this
stretched
the
patience
of
many
thousands
of
people
in
the
EU
to
the
limit
.
In
fact
,
all
hell
broke
loose
in
some
municipalities
in
my
province
.
Prevention
has
to
be
our
answer
to
disasters
of
this
kind
and
this
draft
Directive
is
an
important
step
towards
well
-
trained
safety
advisers
being
available
,
so
that
the
right
action
is
taken
in
good
time
.
All
the
same
,
we
must
not
content
ourselves
with
enacting
European
law
to
ensure
greater
safety
.
We
also
need
to
follow
this
up
and
make
sure
that
our
rules
are
transposed
by
the
Member
States
in
good
time
and
-
even
more
importantly
-
we
need
to
ensure
that
they
are
also
applied
afterwards
.
We
must
not
content
ourselves
with
sealing
another
hole
in
the
safety
net
and
shutting
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
,
where
transport
safety
in
Europe
is
concerned
,
there
is
still
much
more
to
be
done
.
In
this
context
,
I
should
like
to
make
a
request
and
ask
the
Commissioner
responsible
,
who
is
with
us
here
today
,
to
table
an
appropriate
text
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
view
to
continuing
to
make
it
safer
for
traffic
to
transit
tunnels
in
the
future
,
so
that
we
in
Europe
do
not
have
to
experience
any
more
such
disasters
on
this
scale
.
Madam
President
,
first
of
all
I
should
like
to
thank
Mr
Koch
for
his
report
which
has
,
at
its
heart
,
the
issue
of
transport
safety
.
I
congratulate
him
on
his
excellent
report
.
the
Paddington
rail
crash
in
London
,
the
terrible
rail
crash
in
Norway
,
the
two
aviation
crashes
involving
EU
citizens
and
the
natural
disaster
involving
the
Erika
off
Brittany
-
all
within
the
last
four
months
-
remind
us
that
transport
safety
can
never
be
taken
for
granted
and
that
those
charged
with
protecting
the
public
must
be
highly
motivated
and
highly
qualified
.
The
rapporteur
has
pointed
out
to
the
House
that
in
its
common
position
the
Council
has
accepted
six
of
Parliament
's
ten
amendments
put
forward
at
first
reading
and
that
the
substance
of
Parliament
's
other
amendments
has
been
retained
.
My
Group
will
therefore
support
the
common
position
and
looks
forward
to
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
which
will
provide
us
with
yet
another
tool
in
our
fight
to
make
transport
in
the
European
Union
as
safe
as
possible
.
When
it
comes
to
safety
my
Group
will
always
support
any
initiatives
to
improve
transport
safety
.
We
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
in
this
area
as
recent
events
have
proved
.
Madam
President
,
I
would
like
to
make
a
few
comments
.
I
would
like
,
first
of
all
,
to
thank
the
rapporteur
for
his
exceptionally
accurate
and
technical
work
on
the
report
and
,
secondly
,
the
Commission
for
the
proposal
it
has
submitted
.
We
are
concerned
here
with
the
harmonisation
of
examination
requirements
but
also
,
in
fact
,
with
minimum
requirements
.
This
is
important
,
but
so
is
enforcement
and
there
are
,
of
course
,
a
number
of
reasons
why
we
need
to
pay
particular
attention
to
this
.
Or
ships
from
Eastern
Europe
which
moor
adjacent
to
ships
over
here
,
with
all
the
obvious
risks
that
this
entails
.
Furthermore
,
it
has
transpired
that
research
in
the
ports
in
Belgium
,
Finland
,
but
also
in
Japan
has
shown
that
50
%
of
containers
with
partially
dangerous
cargo
are
not
delivered
correctly
for
shipment
.
In
short
,
the
issue
is
an
important
one
.
If
we
look
at
the
situation
where
safety
advisers
are
concerned
,
in
a
number
of
countries
it
is
compulsory
to
employ
such
safety
advisers
in
companies
as
from
1
January
of
this
year
.
There
will
be
major
problems
with
enforcing
this
rule
at
present
,
especially
with
smaller
companies
,
as
these
cannot
afford
safety
advisors
.
These
smaller
companies
either
dispose
of
their
cargo
or
mix
it
with
other
cargo
,
which
causes
problems
.
It
is
therefore
also
being
requested
that
ISO
9002
certificates
possibly
include
the
finer
details
of
these
activities
in
the
form
of
annual
reports
and
company
analyses
.
The
work
is
done
.
I
would
like
to
mention
one
final
point
.
With
regard
to
enforcement
,
proper
agreements
must
also
be
concluded
with
the
Eastern
European
countries
because
they
will
not
enter
into
treaties
which
deal
with
this
matter
until
1
July
2001
,
that
is
to
say
in
eighteen
months
'
time
.
This
gives
them
a
competitive
edge
for
the
interim
period
.
This
is
not
in
itself
anything
dreadful
,
but
we
should
prioritise
particularly
the
safety
aspects
for
goods
transported
by
road
,
rail
and
inland
waterways
and
incorporate
these
,
as
part
of
the
acquis
communautaire
,
as
soon
as
possible
and
present
them
to
the
acceding
states
.
Madam
President
,
the
importance
of
transport
safety
is
highlighted
on
a
regular
basis
in
this
Parliament
and
rightly
so
.
The
ever
increasing
volume
of
goods
passing
through
Europe
entails
all
kinds
of
risks
,
known
and
unknown
,
for
employees
and
the
social
environment
.
Those
having
to
deal
with
these
risks
should
therefore
meet
stringent
requirements
.
The
relevant
standards
which
have
been
laid
down
in
another
Directive
,
95
/
35
/
EC
,
seem
sufficiently
adequate
to
advise
people
in
a
responsible
manner
on
the
organisation
of
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
.
I
am
very
pleased
that
agreement
has
also
been
reached
with
the
Council
on
minimum
standards
regarding
examinations
,
although
I
would
have
preferred
it
if
uniform
,
set
standards
and
modules
had
been
established
,
so
that
certificates
would
be
of
equal
value
internationally
.
This
,
however
,
does
not
seem
feasible
.
Finally
,
the
amendment
tabled
by
the
rapporteur
is
perfectly
logical
and
I
can
,
therefore
,
give
it
my
wholehearted
support
.
Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
I
should
first
like
to
congratulate
Mr
Koch
on
his
reports
which
,
though
technical
,
are
nonetheless
of
very
great
significance
for
safety
.
I
should
like
to
make
just
a
few
comments
.
Firstly
,
I
should
like
to
ask
the
Commissioner
-
and
I
am
convinced
that
my
request
will
fall
on
fertile
ground
-
to
ensure
that
more
attention
is
paid
to
the
issue
of
safety
,
be
it
on
the
roads
,
on
the
waterways
or
at
sea
.
Considering
that
it
is
only
today
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
Commission
proposal
first
made
on
19
March
1998
,
even
though
Parliament
responded
relatively
quickly
,
this
time
lag
is
a
little
too
long
.
My
second
point
has
already
been
mentioned
:
In
principle
,
I
believe
that
in
many
cases
where
transport
is
concerned
we
should
be
working
towards
increased
flexibility
and
country
-
specific
rules
.
However
,
when
it
comes
to
safety
,
I
am
rather
sceptical
because
safety
in
Sweden
,
for
example
,
is
in
principle
no
different
from
safety
in
Germany
,
Italy
or
Austria
.
Should
flexibility
of
this
kind
result
in
there
being
inadequate
rules
in
some
countries
then
we
should
work
towards
greater
harmonisation
.
My
third
point
has
also
been
mentioned
already
.
As
you
know
,
like
Mr
Rack
,
I
come
from
a
transit
country
,
where
this
issue
plays
a
particularly
important
role
.
We
do
not
want
to
make
the
conditions
of
competition
worse
for
some
countries
unilaterally
and
improve
them
for
countries
such
as
Austria
or
other
transit
countries
.
Mr
President
,
I
would
firstly
like
to
congratulate
the
rapporteur
,
Mr
Koch
,
on
his
magnificent
work
and
his
positive
cooperation
with
the
Commission
with
regard
to
improving
the
texts
and
presenting
this
report
and
this
proposal
;
in
the
end
there
is
only
one
amendment
on
the
requirements
for
the
aptitude
examination
for
safety
advisers
in
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
by
road
,
rail
or
inland
waterway
.
We
understand
that
it
is
important
that
the
two
institutions
-
Parliament
and
Commission
-
cooperate
and
work
together
and
that
the
current
cooperation
with
the
Committee
on
Regional
Policy
,
and
in
particular
the
transport
group
,
is
magnificent
.
The
common
position
includes
practically
all
of
the
amendments
accepted
by
the
Commission
and
harmonises
the
minimum
examination
requirements
for
safety
advisers
and
,
at
second
reading
,
we
can
accept
the
amendment
on
the
proposed
date
,
which
is
much
more
realistic
than
the
one
originally
suggested
by
the
Commission
,
bearing
in
mind
that
we
have
now
spent
several
years
debating
this
question
.
Very
briefly
,
I
would
like
to
thank
the
various
Members
for
their
interventions
and
to
tell
you
that
safety
is
one
of
the
Commission
's
priorities
in
the
field
of
transport
.
As
Mr
Simpson
has
said
very
correctly
,
this
is
a
process
which
we
can
never
take
for
granted
or
regard
as
having
come
to
an
end
.
The
process
of
increasing
safety
margins
and
safety
guarantees
in
transport
is
a
process
which
must
be
improved
day
by
day
.
In
this
regard
,
I
would
also
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
problems
of
the
tunnels
,
which
Messrs
Rack
and
Swoboda
have
referred
to
,
which
,
in
the
case
of
Austria
,
is
doubtless
a
very
sensitive
issue
,
and
great
effort
should
be
made
to
improve
their
safety
.
In
one
of
the
worst
accidents
to
have
occurred
recently
,
the
goods
being
transported
were
not
dangerous
in
themselves
.
Margarine
and
a
few
kilos
of
paint
which
,
in
principle
,
do
not
present
risks
,
led
to
a
genuine
disaster
.
Therefore
,
we
will
have
to
see
how
the
requirements
guaranteeing
the
maximum
degree
of
safety
can
be
further
improved
.
Finally
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
we
have
to
consider
safety
in
all
types
of
transport
.
This
week
we
will
be
holding
a
debate
here
on
the
safety
of
sea
transport
,
in
light
of
the
Erika
disaster
,
and
in
the
course
of
this
year
we
will
have
to
discuss
our
objectives
in
terms
of
the
safety
of
air
transport
.
But
I
would
like
to
say
that
safety
is
a
priority
objective
for
the
Commission
.
As
I
will
say
in
the
debate
on
the
Erika
disaster
,
we
do
not
wait
until
there
is
a
disaster
to
deal
with
the
question
of
safety
,
but
we
work
on
it
even
when
there
are
no
such
circumstances
,
which
simply
serve
to
demonstrate
the
urgency
for
an
effective
response
to
this
type
of
problem
.
I
would
like
to
repeat
my
appreciation
to
all
the
speakers
and
especially
to
the
rapporteur
,
Mr
Koch
.
The
debate
is
closed
.
The
vote
will
take
place
tomorrow
at
12
p.m.
.
Transport
of
dangerous
goods
by
road
.
The
next
item
is
the
report
(
A5-0104
/
1999
)
by
Mr
Koch
,
on
behalf
of
the
Committee
on
Regional
Policy
,

Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
the
Directive
on
the
approximation
of
the
laws
of
the
member
states
with
regard
to
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
by
road
,
which
entered
into
force
on
1
January
1997
,
contains
a
number
of
transitional
provisions
which
are
only
valid
for
a
limited
period
of
time
,
the
term
of
validity
being
linked
to
the
completion
of
specific
standardisation
work
by
the
CEN
,
that
is
the
European
committee
for
standardisation
.
Delays
in
the
CEN
's
work
are
now
making
it
difficult
to
apply
this
very
Directive
.
In
particular
,
annexes
cannot
be
adapted
to
take
account
of
technical
and
industrial
developments
.
I
regret
this
since
we
are
having
to
take
action
because
others
have
not
done
their
job
.
In
this
respect
,
I
accept
this
proposal
to
amend
Directive
94
/
55
/
EC
which
has
been
tabled
for
discussion
today
.
Should
the
European
Union
fail
to
take
action
,
then
Member
States
would
be
obliged
to
amend
their
national
legislation
for
a
very
brief
period
,
until
the
CEN
completes
its
work
,
which
would
cause
unnecessary
cost
and
uncertainty
.
The
amendment
to
the
Directive
on
today
's
agenda
does
not
therefore
affect
the
existing
harmonisation
of
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
in
the
community
.
It
merely
prolongs
transitional
rules
by
postponing
deadlines
,
deletes
provisions
which
are
no
longer
applicable
,
and
lays
down
the
procedures
for
a
)
carrying
out
the
ad
hoc
transportation
of
dangerous
goods
and
b
)
enacting
less
stringent
national
regulations
,
in
particular
for
the
transport
of
very
small
amounts
of
dangerous
goods
within
strictly
defined
local
areas
.
The
amendment
to
the
Directive
is
consequently
in
full
accordance
with
the
principle
of
subsidiarity
;
the
Member
States
obtain
more
powers
.
In
so
doing
,
it
is
supported
by
a
committee
of
experts
on
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
under
the
regulatory
procedure
.
The
procedures
for
the
exercise
of
these
implementing
powers
conferred
on
the
Commission
were
laid
down
afresh
in
the
Council
Decision
of
June
1999
.
Two
of
the
amendments
tabled
and
adopted
unanimously
by
the
committee
relate
precisely
to
this
amended
comitology
procedure
.
We
would
like
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
reference
to
this
as
early
as
the
recitals
and
that
the
period
within
which
the
Council
has
to
make
a
decision
-
which
is
not
clearly
worded
-
is
set
at
a
maximum
of
three
months
.
In
addition
,
the
need
for
greater
transparency
has
been
pointed
out
.
A
final
amendment
is
intended
to
ensure
that
tanks
and
tankers
put
into
service
between
1
January
1997
and
the
entry
into
force
of
this
Directive
may
continue
to
be
used
provided
that
they
have
been
constructed
and
maintained
in
accordance
with
it
.
Mr
President
,
colleagues
,
a
happy
new
year
and
millennium
to
you
all
.
I
would
like
to
briefly
comment
on
the
Commission
's
proposal
to
amend
the
Directive
on
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
by
road
.
It
is
good
that
this
Directive
should
be
established
now
,
as
,
otherwise
,
member
states
would
have
to
amend
their
national
acts
for
a
very
short
time
,
a
period
of
transition
,
which
would
again
mean
unnecessary
costs
and
which
would
once
more
increase
concern
with
regard
to
EU
bureaucracy
.
My
amendments
concern
the
frost
-
resistance
ratings
for
tankers
carrying
these
dangerous
goods
.
According
to
the
Commission
's
proposal
-20º
C
would
have
been
sufficient
.
On
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
in
Lapland
temperatures
can
fall
considerably
lower
than
that
.
There
is
support
for
the
EU
in
Lapland
also
,
so
let
us
remember
them
.
I
have
thus
proposed
that
the
frost
rating
be
lowered
to
-40°
C
.
This
would
be
necessary
to
keep
safety
standards
at
the
level
they
were
in
northern
regions
previously
.
Mr
President
,
with
your
permission
I
should
like
to
begin
by
expressing
my
admiration
for
the
way
in
which
you
executed
the
quick
changeover
of
the
chairmanship
just
now
during
the
debate
.
I
thought
that
it
was
quite
superb
.
On
the
subject
at
hand
,
I
think
that
the
people
of
Europe
must
be
able
to
be
confident
that
the
goods
-
however
dangerous
they
are
-
which
are
transported
on
Europe
's
roads
,
railways
,
and
so
on
are
as
safe
as
possible
.
This
Directive
is
a
contribution
to
this
.
What
we
are
doing
today
is
essentially
a
nuisance
.
The
rapporteur
,
Mr
Koch
,
to
whom
we
express
our
thanks
for
the
work
which
he
has
done
on
this
,
has
already
pointed
out
that
basically
everything
could
have
been
somewhat
more
advanced
had
it
not
been
for
the
inactivity
on
the
part
of
the
CEN
,
which
has
been
very
dilatory
in
drawing
up
and
adapting
the
Directive
.
This
is
also
important
where
the
prerequisites
for
the
internal
market
are
concerned
.
If
we
are
to
get
a
common
transport
market
genuinely
up
and
running
,
it
is
important
that
we
should
not
only
have
regulations
but
that
these
regulations
should
also
,
as
far
as
possible
,
apply
to
every
country
.
I
should
like
to
conclude
by
commenting
on
a
third
matter
which
is
also
of
significance
,
namely
an
amendment
tabled
by
Member
of
Parliament
,
Mr
Ari
Vatanen
.
By
approving
this
amendment
,
we
take
account
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
very
cold
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
European
Union
.
This
makes
it
necessary
to
also
take
account
of
the
ways
in
which
materials
and
packaging
are
affected
by
cold
of
this
kind
.
It
is
good
that
,
in
establishing
the
present
regulations
,
we
can
also
be
flexible
.
I
hope
that
the
Commission
is
able
to
accept
the
present
amendment
.
Mr
President
,
I
would
like
to
thank
not
only
Mr
Koch
,
but
also
the
Vice
-
President
of
the
Commission
for
the
clear
and
unambiguous
way
in
which
they
have
declared
their
support
for
safety
in
the
transport
sector
and
acknowledged
it
as
a
priority
.
For
one
thing
is
clear
:
We
all
regret
that
the
European
Committee
for
Standardisation
(
CEN
)
has
not
been
able
,
in
the
required
time
,
to
carry
out
the
amendment
of
the
provisions
necessary
for
the
required
harmonisation
within
the
European
Union
.
This
debate
and
the
amendment
of
the
Directive
currently
in
force
allow
us
to
incorporate
differentiating
elements
which
demonstrate
the
diversity
of
this
Europe
of
ours
.
A
moment
ago
,
Mr
Vatanen
spoke
to
us
of
lower
temperatures
,
not
of
20
degrees
below
zero
,
but
of
40
degrees
below
zero
.
Of
course
,
we
accept
that
amendment
-
it
is
absolutely
right
-
and
I
believe
that
we
should
incorporate
specific
circumstances
which
demonstrate
the
climatic
diversity
of
the
European
Union
,
which
sometimes
take
the
form
of
specifics
and
of
concrete
requirements
for
the
establishment
of
standards
and
characterisations
of
a
technical
nature
.
I
would
like
to
say
,
with
regard
to
Mr
Swoboda
's
comments
on
the
activity
of
the
CEN
,
that
we
are
urging
them
to
speed
up
their
work
as
much
as
possible
because
it
would
be
terrible
if
,
despite
the
new
deadline
,
we
were
to
find
ourselves
after
a
year
and
a
bit
with
the
same
difficulties
because
their
work
has
not
been
concluded
.
The
Commission
accepts
all
of
the
contributions
of
the
parliamentary
committee
and
the
rapporteur
,
Mr
Koch
,
which
are
contained
in
the
various
amendments
,
specifically
four
.
We
therefore
accept
the
four
amendments
which
have
been
proposed
.
Structural
Funds
-
Cohesion
Fund
coordination
.
The
next
item
is
the
report
(
A5-0108
/
1999
)
by
Mrs
Schroedter
,
on
behalf
of
the
Committee
on
Regional
Policy
,
Transport
and
Tourism
,
on
the
communication
from
the
Commission
in
the
field
of
the
Structural
Funds
and
their
coordination
with
the
Cohesion
Fund
:
Mr
President
,
it
is
particularly
pleasing
for
me
to
make
my
first
speech
in
the
European
Parliament
on
what
is
regarded
as
the
most
important
issue
within
that
part
of
the
United
Kingdom
that
I
represent
in
this
Parliament
,
namely
Wales
.
A
major
part
of
Wales
,
as
you
know
,
has
been
granted
Objective
1
status
under
the
Structural
Funds
programme
.
It
is
quite
clear
that
many
people
within
Wales
are
looking
to
the
European
Structural
Funds
programme
to
alleviate
some
of
the
great
difficulties
that
we
undoubtedly
face
.
We
have
seen
the
gap
between
rich
and
poor
widen
.
We
are
looking
,
therefore
,
within
the
Structural
Funds
programme
not
just
to
see
industrial
restructuring
but
also
to
see
a
wider
improvement
in
the
whole
of
the
economic
base
within
the
Principality
.
That
is
why
I
want
to
highlight
some
of
the
issues
that
I
believe
the
Commission
must
have
at
the
forefront
.
We
look
to
the
Commission
to
deal
with
points
in
relation
to
additionality
.
We
are
dissatisfied
with
the
fact
that
those
figures
seem
to
have
been
in
some
way
hidden
within
UK
figures
.
We
look
to
the
Commission
also
to
ensure
that
there
is
matched
funding
for
projects
.
We
look
to
it
to
challenge
the
UK
Government
,
to
ensure
that
the
private
sector
,
which
surely
must
be
providing
the
major
impetus
for
Structural
Funds
expenditure
,
is
involved
in
the
planning
stage
.
Finally
,
we
ask
that
the
Commission
ensures
that
Structural
Fund
monies
are
spent
in
a
way
which
is
transparent
.
Too
much
of
what
takes
place
within
this
Parliament
is
not
transparent
.
This
is
one
area
in
which
I
believe
the
Commission
can
be
a
very
great
friend
to
Wales
.
Mr
President
,
our
committee
views
these
issues
very
differently
and
,
to
start
,
I
will
speak
from
the
point
of
view
of
research
.
We
see
it
as
a
very
positive
sign
that
,
in
her
own
conclusions
,
the
rapporteur
has
taken
account
of
our
committee
's
proposal
that
the
Cohesion
Fund
countries
should
broaden
the
research
infrastructure
by
locating
universities
and
colleges
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
serve
those
who
live
in
undeveloped
regions
better
than
now
and
make
it
easier
for
educated
people
to
remain
in
their
home
districts
.
Another
matter
we
would
like
to
address
,
specifically
from
the
point
of
view
of
industrial
policy
,
is
that
we
would
have
liked
the
Commission
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
effects
of
services
,
electronic
commerce
and
the
growing
use
of
the
Internet
,
when
they
were
planning
the
coordination
of
Structural
Funds
and
Cohesion
Funds
.
Poverty
and
wealth
used
to
depend
more
on
means
of
livelihood
.
In
my
opinion
the
committee
drafting
the
report
has
not
taken
sufficient
account
of
this
,
so
on
behalf
of
the
Committee
on
Industry
,
External
Trade
,
Research
and
Energy
,
I
would
draw
the
Commission
's
attention
to
this
issue
.
Finally
,
as
the
committee
representing
energy
,
we
would
have
liked
the
issue
of
support
for
renewable
energy
resources
from
Cohesion
and
Regional
Development
funds
to
have
been
emphasised
still
more
,
thus
,
through
a
process
of
coordination
,
increasing
the
use
of
renewables
so
that
the
scant
funding
resources
in
the
energy
programme
might
have
been
compensated
by
means
of
these
more
substantial
sums
.
I
would
like
to
draw
people
's
attention
to
Amendments
Nos
1
and
2
which
were
agreed
by
the
Committee
on
Employment
and
Social
Affairs
but
not
accepted
by
the
Committee
on
Regional
Policy
,
Transport
and
Tourism
.
These
amendments
deal
with
the
social
economy
and
the
need
to
provide
social
risk
capital
and
support
financially
local
schemes
to
develop
employment
opportunities
and
strengthen
social
cohesion
.
In
the
past
,
this
Parliament
has
viewed
the
social
economy
as
an
important
potential
provider
of
employment
.
These
amendments
also
fit
in
with
this
Parliament
's
view
that
social
exclusion
is
a
serious
issue
needing
constructive
action
.
We
hope
that
those
considering
rejection
of
these
amendments
have
very
powerful
reasons
to
offer
to
both
Parliament
and
their
citizens
who
are
seeking
employment
.
In
her
report
,
Mrs
Flautre
also
drew
attention
to
an
area
where
coordination
is
sorely
lacking
,
yet
desperately
needed
.
The
Commission
proposals
refer
to
the
four
pillars
of
employment
strategy
and
the
five
fields
of
action
of
the
European
Social
Fund
.
It
could
be
said
that
the
omission
gives
the
impression
that
the
Commission
too
has
no
idea
how
to
provide
maximum
coordination
between
European
Social
Fund
assistance
,
which
is
subject
to
review
after
three
and
a
half
years
,
and
the
Member
States
'
annual
national
plans
for
employment
.
We
hope
that
the
Commission
can
reassure
us
that
this
was
an
oversight
which
is
now
being
dealt
with
constructively
.
Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
the
proposal
presented
by
the
Commission
,
in
accordance
with
its
mandate
,
is
a
reasonable
starting
point
for
the
Committee
on
Agriculture
and
Rural
Development
.
I
would
like
to
point
out
,
however
,
that
this
starting
point
indicates
to
us
the
challenges
which
face
us
:
maintaining
a
population
in
rural
areas
,
given
the
changes
taking
place
in
all
types
of
economic
activity
owing
to
agriculture
's
increasing
lack
of
importance
amongst
the
various
sources
of
income
for
rural
society
.
This
,
as
well
as
the
deficiencies
in
the
networks
of
infrastructures
and
services
and
a
generally
very
low
level
of
employment
,
which
furthermore
is
seasonal
and
lacks
diversity
,
exacerbates
the
exodus
from
rural
areas
.
The
consequences
do
not
inspire
hope
.
It
is
the
young
people
who
are
disappearing
,
who
are
getting
an
education
and
finding
work
outside
of
the
rural
areas
,
all
of
which
has
an
unfavourable
effect
on
those
areas
.
This
lack
of
infrastructure
is
also
an
obstacle
to
the
establishment
of
companies
and
the
creation
of
jobs
.
Agriculture
only
provides
5.5
%
of
employment
in
the
Union
.
Furthermore
,
three
quarters
of
our
farm
workers
are
part-time
and
require
supplements
to
their
incomes
.
For
this
reason
,
one
of
the
most
important
and
essential
objectives
which
we
should
set
in
the
European
Union
is
to
make
efforts
to
create
new
jobs
in
rural
areas
,
outside
of
the
agricultural
sector
,
in
sectors
such
as
rural
tourism
,
sport
,
culture
,
heritage
conservation
,
the
conversion
of
businesses
,
new
technologies
,
services
,
etc.
.
However
,
even
though
the
role
of
agriculture
is
not
exclusive
,
it
is
still
essential
,
not
only
to
prevent
economic
and
social
disintegration
and
the
creation
of
ghost
towns
,
but
also
because
farmers
play
a
fundamental
role
in
managing
the
land
,
in
preserving
biodiversity
and
in
protecting
the
environment
.
It
is
important
to
prioritise
general
criteria
for
land
planning
and
demographic
equilibrium
,
and
to
bear
in
mind
the
conclusions
of
the
Committee
on
Agriculture
and
Rural
Development
on
the
five
fundamental
issues
,
which
have
been
only
partly
taken
up
by
the
Committee
on
Transport
,
Regional
Policy
and
Tourism
in
its
points
16
and
17
.
In
conclusion
,
I
would
ask
the
Commission
to
take
these
five
points
into
account
when
establishing
the
conclusions
on
the
four
pillars
because
I
believe
that
,
for
the
European
Union
,
maintaining
the
population
in
rural
areas
must
be
one
of
the
priority
objectives
.
Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
I
would
like
to
begin
by
thanking
Mrs
Schroedter
,
the
rapporteur
,
for
her
work
.
I
would
also
like
to
thank
her
for
her
willingness
to
enter
into
dialogue
with
the
other
political
groups
when
compromise
formulas
have
needed
to
be
reached
in
the
face
of
this
avalanche
of
amendments
-
and
perhaps
there
are
more
of
them
than
we
expected
-
but
which
genuinely
reflect
the
importance
of
the
report
we
are
now
discussing
.
We
feel
that
it
is
important
that
the
Commission
takes
account
of
the
conclusions
adopted
by
this
Parliament
,
at
least
in
spirit
,
because
at
this
stage
,
it
might
seem
as
though
what
we
are
doing
here
is
a
useless
exercise
,
and
nothing
but
hot
air
.
In
our
amendments
,
we
have
stated
the
importance
of
the
necessary
synergies
being
produced
between
the
Structural
Funds
,
the
Cohesion
Fund
and
Community
initiatives
,
so
that
their
application
should
be
reflected
,
in
the
best
and
most
profitable
way
,
by
the
gradual
elimination
of
disparities
between
regions
and
by
the
creation
of
jobs
which
are
,
when
all
is
said
and
done
,
the
two
central
purposes
of
the
funds
we
are
discussing
.
In
order
to
achieve
a
more
rapid
and
efficient
boost
for
attaining
these
objectives
,
we
think
that
those
who
generate
employment
,
the
real
entrepreneurs
and
those
who
really
guarantee
new
sources
of
employment
,
that
is
,
businesspeople
,
must
participate
in
this
initiative
.
Small
and
medium-sized
businesses
,
above
all
,
need
to
take
part
in
the
distribution
of
these
funds
.
If
they
do
not
,
if
businesspeople
feel
marginalised
,
if
entrepreneurs
cannot
take
part
,
not
only
in
managing
but
also
in
receiving
these
funds
,
we
will
have
missed
an
opportunity
to
attain
our
objectives
more
rapidly
.
Also
,
in
order
to
attain
our
objectives
,
to
overcome
the
disparities
between
regions
and
to
seek
out
sources
of
employment
,
it
is
crucial
to
give
our
complete
support
to
new
technologies
,
to
transport
and
communications
networks
and
to
renewable
energies
.
All
of
this
must
be
done
-
I
repeat
-
with
the
participation
of
private
business
,
which
,
by
uniting
its
efforts
with
those
of
public
administrations
,
but
complementing
them
,
never
obstructing
or
excluding
them
,
will
lead
to
the
creation
of
wealth
in
society
and
of
jobs
.
Mr
President
,
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
remind
my
colleague
,
Mr
Evans
,
of
why
Wales
actually
achieved
Objective
1
status
.
It
was
because
of
the
discredited
policies
of
his
own
Conservative
Party
.
Let
me
also
remind
him
that
when
his
party
leader
,
Mr
Hague
,
was
Secretary
of
State
for
Wales
,
he
broke
every
rule
in
the
book
on
additionality
which
led
to
a
stern
letter
from
Commissioner
Wulf
-
Mathies
regarding
regulatory
requirements
.
I
can
tell
you
that
the
British
Government
is
aware
of
its
regulatory
requirements
on
Objective
1
additionality
.
I
suggest
Mr
Evans
goes
back
and
reads
the
Regulation
.
My
Group
has
made
extensive
amendments
to
both
reports
up
for
debate
today
.
I
want
to
focus
our
minds
on
the
essential
role
of
the
guidelines
.
It
is
important
to
identify
the
skills
and
potential
of
our
regions
in
the
hi-tech
sector
.
It
is
particularly
important
in
the
light
of
reports
in
the
media
that
Europe
is
rapidly
losing
ground
to
the
US
in
the
hi-tech
growth
industries
of
the
future
.
They
should
not
be
about
creating
additional
layers
of
bureaucracy
and
red
tape
.
The
implementation
and
operation
of
the
guidelines
cannot
be
left
to
the
personal
interpretation
of
one
or
other
desk
officer
,
either
in
the
Commission
or
in
the
civil
service
.
There
must
be
an
internal
coherence
in
the
Commission
directorate
,
while
respecting
the
specific
local
and
regional
aspects
of
Commission
programmes
.
The
conclusion
is
that
we
must
make
the
case
for
guidelines
to
be
broad
,
indicative
and
flexible
to
assist
our
programme
managers
and
fund
-
users
and
to
get
the
maximum
potential
out
of
our
new
fields
of
regeneration
.
The
rapporteur
has
also
quite
rightly
stated
that
Parliament
was
not
heard
in
time
regarding
the
guidelines
.
Hopefully
,
the
stands
Parliament
has
taken
will
help
,
however
,
in
the
mid
-
term
appraisal
of
the
programmes
and
in
their
practical
implementation
.
For
the
time
,
the
report
grew
too
large
when
it
was
being
debated
.
At
this
stage
it
is
more
important
to
concentrate
on
assessing
how
we
can
use
this
process
to
steer
Union
regional
policy
,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
aim
is
to
reduce
regional
inequality
.
Our
Group
emphasises
the
importance
of
the
principle
of
subsidiarity
,
the
responsibility
of
Member
States
and
the
role
of
local
players
in
drafting
and
implementing
programmes
.
It
is
especially
important
to
get
SMEs
involved
in
the
planning
and
implementation
of
programmes
.
Our
Group
also
considers
it
important
to
take
greater
account
of
remote
and
peripheral
areas
and
wishes
to
increase
interaction
between
towns
and
rural
areas
.
Projects
implemented
with
support
from
the
Union
have
had
their
effect
watered
down
all
too
often
by
slow
decision
making
and
complicated
administrative
processes
.
Funds
have
often
been
granted
for
projects
which
have
had
no
lasting
benefit
for
the
area
concerned
.
Projects
have
to
be
carried
out
more
efficiently
,
more
flexibly
and
they
have
to
be
made
more
productive
.
While
the
report
was
being
prepared
,
it
was
interesting
to
discuss
the
Union
's
regional
policy
in
general
.
For
us
new
members
,
it
was
the
first
time
,
and
this
was
a
very
interesting
process
.
This
report
is
very
good
and
our
Group
supports
it
.
Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
as
proof
that
this
Parliament
has
not
yet
overcome
its
role
as
a
consultative
and
subordinate
institution
,
the
excellent
report
by
a
fellow
member
of
my
Group
,
Elisabeth
Schroedter
,
has
not
been
able
to
reach
plenary
sitting
because
the
plans
for
regional
development
for
the
period
2000
-
2006
for
Objective
1
regions
have
been
sitting
in
the
Commission
's
offices
for
several
months
.
Bearing
this
in
mind
,
this
House
should
,
in
any
event
,
demand
that
,
before
the
Community
support
frameworks
for
the
period
in
question
are
approved
,
they
be
studied
and
submitted
for
debate
in
this
Parliament
,
specifically
in
light
of
the
guidelines
that
we
have
presented
today
.
Mr
President
,
we
should
not
forget
that
the
main
,
strategic
objective
of
the
Structural
and
Cohesion
Funds
and
of
their
coordination
is
to
achieve
economic
and
social
cohesion
.
We
are
obliged
to
participate
in
drafting
Directives
and
also
in
assessing
their
results
.
We
are
obliged
to
do
so
because
we
are
the
representatives
of
the
citizens
in
a
Europe
of
Citizens
and
not
just
in
a
Europe
of
States
and
of
Regions
.
We
feel
that
the
Funds
are
a
necessary
but
insufficient
condition
for
achieving
economic
and
social
cohesion
.
We
might
be
mistaken
in
using
the
gross
domestic
product
per
inhabitant
as
the
sole
indicator
.
Some
speakers
have
already
mentioned
unemployment
and
the
fall
in
population
.
We
will
have
to
study
several
indicators
,
which
will
enable
us
to
see
the
current
state
of
regional
societies
that
are
in
a
worse
situation
than
others
,
and
how
they
are
evolving
.
It
is
clear
from
some
of
the
reports
that
have
been
presented
to
Parliament
's
plenary
sitting
today
that
Europe
's
25
most
prosperous
regions
enjoy
a
level
of
unemployment
which
is
five
times
lower
than
in
the
25
least
prosperous
regions
.
This
fact
means
that
the
European
Parliament
,
the
Commissioner
and
the
Commission
must
act
decisively
and
strategically
.
I
agree
that
the
European
Parliament
did
not
have
the
opportunity
-
or
that
it
was
not
given
the
opportunity
,
as
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
parliamentary
term
-
to
discuss
the
Directives
.
I
do
not
think
,
however
,
that
this
report
has
come
too
late
.
We
all
agree
that
we
should
ask
that
,
halfway
through
these
programmes
,
when
the
assessment
of
the
Directives
is
made
,
Parliament
should
be
given
an
equally
influential
role
on
the
grounds
that
we
are
the
citizens
'
representatives
.
Our
citizens
cannot
accept
that
the
European
Union
takes
decisions
in
a
way
that
is
,
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
,
bureaucratic
.
They
need
to
see
the
political
dimension
working
,
to
see
that
officials
accept
their
responsibilities
and
that
there
is
communication
with
the
citizens
.
This
is
what
we
are
today
asking
the
Commissioner
for
.
I
would
like
to
think
that
,
given
his
previous
experience
as
a
regional
President
,
he
will
agree
to
propose
indicators
,
and
a
strategy
,
which
will
favour
economic
and
social
cohesion
and
not
just
productivity
.
Mr
President
,
I
support
the
main
proposals
of
the
report
concerning
the
administration
of
the
Structural
Funds
and
the
Cohesion
Fund
for
the
period
2000
-
2006
and
the
main
recommendations
of
the
report
which
include
the
following
:
Member
States
are
urged
to
attach
greater
importance
to
integrated
strategies
for
revitalising
relations
between
towns
and
rural
areas
.
This
process
will
continue
in
accordance
with
the
financial
spending
guidelines
laid
down
by
the
EU
leaders
at
their
Berlin
Summit
last
year
,
which
were
supported
by
Parliament
at
its
last
May
plenary
part
-
session
.
Key
EU
programmes
between
1989
,
1993
,
1994
and
1999
have
certainly
helped
to
improve
the
economic
competitiveness
of
peripheral
countries
and
Objective
1
regions
within
Europe
.
In
conclusion
,
while
key
infrastructure
projects
have
been
supported
by
the
European
Regional
Development
Fund
and
the
Cohesion
Fund
,
we
should
remember
that
the
European
Social
Fund
has
played
a
very
important
role
in
helping
the
less
well-off
in
our
society
.
The
Social
Fund
has
certainly
improved
our
third
-
level
institutions
,
financed
our
post
-
leaving
certificate
programmes
and
put
in
place
comprehensive
schemes
to
help
combat
youth
and
long-term
unemployment
,
assist
early
school
leavers
and
promote
higher
standards
of
adult
literacy
.
Mr
President
,
on
numerous
occasions
in
the
past
I
have
disagreed
with
the
rapporteur
on
her
approach
to
regional
policy
issues
.
The
second
point
I
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
would
have
preferred
it
if
the
guidelines
had
been
added
to
the
Regulation
in
the
form
of
an
annex
,
as
we
and
Mrs
Mccarthy
,
as
rapporteurs
for
the
general
Regulation
,
had
asked
.
I
am
raising
the
issue
just
to
reiterate
Parliament
's
position
.
They
are
particularly
beneficial
to
the
Member
States
,
and
I
would
particularly
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
emphasis
the
Commission
has
placed
on
the
issues
of
sustainable
development
,
job
creation
and
,
more
particularly
,
on
equal
opportunities
and
transport
issues
.
Personally
,
I
at
least
am
totally
in
favour
of
the
guidelines
.
As
an
islander
,
however
,
I
would
like
to
express
my
dissatisfaction
at
the
lack
of
recognition
of
island
development
.
This
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
issue
has
not
been
given
the
consideration
it
deserves
.
Commissioner
,
we
shall
continue
to
raise
the
issue
,
as
Article
158
,
paragraph
1
,
of
the
Treaty
of
Amsterdam
provides
for
an
integrated
policy
for
islands
.
Therefore
,
the
Commission
should
address
the
issue
once
and
for
all
.
As
for
us
in
Parliament
,
I
would
like
to
remind
you
of
the
code
of
conduct
between
the
Commission
and
Parliament
which
was
signed
in
May
.
I
am
absolutely
certain
that
this
code
will
be
observed
and
that
Parliament
will
keep
abreast
of
all
the
developments
and
details
concerning
the
implementation
of
the
programmes
.
Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
in
this
minute
and
a
half
I
should
like
,
first
of
all
,
to
congratulate
Mrs
Schroedter
.
I
know
many
have
already
done
so
,
but
she
has
indeed
earned
our
praise
for
being
particularly
open
and
attentive
to
proposals
from
all
sides
,
and
I
think
it
is
this
openness
which
has
given
her
report
the
quality
we
see
today
.
I
share
the
regrets
she
expressed
,
namely
that
Parliament
has
become
involved
rather
late
in
the
day
as
regards
these
guidelines
,
since
by
now
the
procedure
for
negotiations
with
the
states
is
so
far
advanced
that
I
cannot
see
this
report
having
any
sort
of
immediate
effect
,
which
in
my
view
is
a
pity
.
In
brief
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
we
are
entering
the
period
when
we
are
called
upon
to
manage
the
programming
for
2000
-
2006
,
which
must
be
no
routine
period
for
the
good
reason
that
we
have
two
major
challenges
to
face
.
The
first
is
the
harmonisation
of
national
development
policies
and
regional
development
policies
.
Subsidies
are
not
enough
to
ensure
development
when
infrastructure
and
public
services
are
lacking
.
We
must
ask
ourselves
a
fundamental
question
:
The
second
challenge
is
that
of
enlargement
which
will
,
of
course
,
have
a
considerable
impact
,
both
in
budgetary
and
geographical
terms
.
These
are
two
areas
of
action
which
I
invite
the
Commissioner
to
set
up
and
in
which
I
would
ask
him
to
involve
us
.
Finally
,
in
this
time
of
natural
disasters
,
I
would
just
like
to
mention
the
issue
of
the
use
of
Structural
Funds
.
As
you
know
,
it
is
up
to
each
State
to
redistribute
part
of
the
total
appropriation
.
Europe
should
not
be
completely
absent
,
as
the
states
tend
to
want
.
Public
opinion
and
the
press
nowadays
accuse
us
of
being
unavailable
to
give
a
response
,
even
though
we
are
going
to
be
funding
a
large
proportion
of
the
national
operations
.
I
think
we
should
be
capable
of
saying
this
loud
and
clear
.
I
also
think
we
should
ensure
,
or
ask
Member
States
to
ensure
,
that
there
is
some
publicity
given
to
European
aid
whenever
it
is
used
to
repair
damage
caused
by
natural
disasters
or
accidents
.
Mr
President
,
the
priority
given
to
financial
and
monetary
criteria
reinforces
the
increase
in
inequalities
of
every
shape
and
form
.
Well
,
the
Structural
Funds
have
helped
to
apply
a
brake
to
this
process
.
Our
project
of
a
Europe
that
aims
to
satisfy
social
needs
envisages
the
convergence
of
living
conditions
towards
the
highest
common
denominator
.
What
we
are
proposing
specifically
is
a
unified
capital
tax
,
which
would
make
it
possible
to
boost
the
funds
used
to
support
the
harmonisation
of
social
protection
systems
and
the
reduction
of
working
hours
at
European
level
.
The
Commission
,
however
,
though
bound
to
issue
guidelines
,
does
so
only
reluctantly
and
in
a
vague
manner
.
The
report
put
forward
today
re-establishes
its
place
in
the
political
sphere
.
This
is
what
persuades
us
to
vote
in
favour
of
it
.
Over
the
coming
years
,
faced
with
the
challenges
of
globalisation
and
eastward
enlargement
,
Europe
will
,
more
than
ever
before
,
require
appropriate
detailed
guidance
on
how
to
plan
and
revitalise
its
economy
.
To
this
end
,
Europe
as
a
whole
,
and
each
Member
State
individually
,
will
have
to
make
optimum
use
of
all
available
resources
and
capacities
,
including
the
Structural
Funds
.
For
this
to
be
possible
,
what
we
need
from
the
European
Commission
are
not
just
good
intentions
,
but
clearer
guidelines
and
a
firm
commitment
to
monitoring
the
way
these
resources
are
used
by
the
Member
States
.
For
example
,
in
recent
years
Italy
has
had
problems
in
utilising
the
Structural
Funds
,
mainly
because
of
excessive
bureaucracy
,
insufficient
information
and
a
lack
of
involvement
of
economic
and
social
operators
at
local
level
.
There
are
,
therefore
,
two
points
to
which
I
would
like
to
draw
the
Commission
's
attention
.
Firstly
,
we
need
to
make
the
best
possible
use
of
consultation
as
a
means
of
ensuring
proper
coordination
and
participation
by
all
local
and
regional
operators
in
decision
-
making
,
precisely
so
that
imbalances
and
inequalities
can
be
avoided
.
Before
you
sign
up
.
Does
it
cost
money
to
use
Facebook
?
Is
it
true
that
Facebook
is
going
to
charge
to
use
the
site
?
Facebook
is
a
free
site
and
will
never
require
that
you
pay
to
continue
using
the
site
.
You
do
,
however
,
have
the
option
of
purchasing
Facebook
credits
,
which
can
be
used
to
send
gifts
or
to
purchase
items
on
applications
or
games
.
What
is
the
minimum
age
required
to
sign
up
for
Facebook
?
In
order
to
be
eligible
to
sign
up
for
Facebook
,
people
must
be
13
years
of
age
or
older
.
Can
I
create
a
joint
Facebook
account
or
share
a
Facebook
account
with
someone
else
?
Facebook
accounts
are
for
individual
use
.
This
means
that
we
don't
allow
joint
accounts
.
Additionally
,
you
can
only
sign
up
for
one
Facebook
account
per
email
address
.
Since
each
account
belongs
to
one
person
,
we
require
everyone
to
use
their
real
name
on
their
account
.
This
way
,
you
always
know
who
you
're
connecting
with
.

After
you
create
an
account
,
you
can
use
Friendship
Pages
to
see
your
interactions
with
any
friend
,
all
in
one
place
.
Why
am
I
getting
a
Facebook
invitation
email
from
a
friend
?
You
received
this
email
because
a
Facebook
member
is
inviting
you
to
join
Facebook
.
Facebook
allows
members
to
send
invites
to
their
contacts
by
entering
an
email
address
or
by
uploading
their
contacts
.
If
you
'd
like
to
,
you
can
add
this
email
address
to
your
existing
Facebook
account
to
ensure
that
you
won't
get
Facebook
invites
sent
to
you
in
the
future
.
If
you
are
not
already
a
Facebook
member
and
would
like
to
join
,
you
can
use
this
email
to
start
the
registration
process
.
If
you
wish
to
no
longer
receive
invites
from
your
friends
,
you
can
use
the
unsubscribe
link
in
the
footer
of
the
email
.

What
's
the
difference
between
logging
in
and
signing
up
?
If
you
don't
have
a
Facebook
account
,
you
can
sign
up
for
one
in
a
few
easy
steps
.
If
you
already
have
a
Facebook
account
,
you
can
log
in
to
your
account
from
the
same
page
.
Just
enter
your
email
address
and
password
into
the
section
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
click
"
Log
In
"
.
What
is
the
minimum
password
strength
?
How
can
I
make
my
password
strong
?
When
creating
a
new
password
,
be
sure
that
it
is
at
least
6
characters
in
length
and
that
you
use
a
complex
string
of
numbers
,
letters
,
and
punctuation
marks
.
If
the
password
you
entered
is
not
strong
enough
,
you
may
want
to
try
mixing
uppercase
and
lowercase
letters
or
making
your
password
longer
.
Ideally
,
the
password
you
select
should
be
easy
for
you
to
remember
but
hard
for
someone
else
to
figure
out
.
For
added
security
,
your
Facebook
password
should
also
be
different
than
other
passwords
that
you
use
on
the
internet
.
How
do
I
add
a
security
question
to
my
account
?
Having
a
security
question
is
a
useful
way
to
verify
you
own
your
account
if
you
ever
lose
access
to
it
.
You
can
add
a
security
question
to
your
account
from
your
Security
Settings
page
:
Click
the
account
menu
at
the
top
right
of
any
Facebook
page
and
choose
Account
Settings
.
From
the
left
column
menu
,
click
Security
.
Click
on
the
Security
Question
section
and
follow
the
onsite
steps
.
You
won't
see
this
section
if
you
've
already
added
a
security
question
to
your
account
.
Tips
for
picking
a
good
security
question
:
Pick
a
question
and
answer
you
know
you
'll
remember
.
Keep
your
security
question
a
secret
.
Make
sure
your
answer
is
specific
enough
that
it
can't
be
guessed
easily
.
You
can
improve
the
overall
security
of
your
account
by
updating
your
security
information

When
you
have
a
broader
presence
on
Facebook
with
Facebook
pages
or
Facebook
events
plus
adverts
for
instance
,
you
can
turn
your
advertising
message
into
a
trusted
referral
by
including
content
from
a
user
’s
friends
who
are
already
affiliated
with
your
products
.
ANA
took
this
approach
by
creating
a
Facebook
page
to
acquire
interested
users
for
ongoing
messaging
opportunities
and
developing
a
compelling
advertising
campaign
.
Average
campaigns
for
ANA
result
in
CTR
of
8
–
12
%
.
Facebook
Adverts
resulted
in
a
25
%
CTR
.
Conversions
resulted
in
positive
ROI
which
is
unique
for
ANA
considering
their
product
is
not
an
impulse
purchase
for
most
people
and
Japan
is
not
traditionally
seen
as
a
leisure
destination

Directive
2005
/
32
/
EC
of
the
European
Parliament
and
of
the
Council
of
6
July
2005
establishing
a
framework
for
the
setting
of
ecodesign
requirements
for
energy
-
using
products
and
amending
Council
Directive
92
/
42
/
EEC
and
Directives
96
/
57
/
EC
and
2000
/
55
/
EC
of
the
European
Parliament
and
of
the
Council
.
The
harmonisation
of
national
laws
is
the
only
means
to
prevent
such
barriers
to
trade
and
unfair
competition
.
(
2
)
Energy
-
using
products
(
EUPs
)
account
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
consumption
of
natural
resources
and
energy
in
the
Community
.
They
also
have
a
number
of
other
important
environmental
impacts
.
For
the
vast
majority
of
product
categories
available
on
the
Community
market
,
very
different
degrees
of
environmental
impact
can
be
noted
though
they
provide
similar
functional
performances
.
In
the
interest
of
sustainable
development
,
continuous
improvement
in
the
overall
environmental
impact
of
those
products
should
be
encouraged
,
notably
by
identifying
the
major
sources
of
negative
environmental
impacts
and
avoiding
transfer
of
pollution
,
when
this
improvement
does
not
entail
excessive
costs
.
(
3
)
The
ecodesign
of
products
is
a
crucial
factor
in
the
Community
strategy
on
Integrated
Product
Policy
.
As
a
preventive
approach
,
designed
to
optimise
the
environmental
performance
of
products
,
while
maintaining
their
functional
qualities
,
it
provides
genuine
new
opportunities
for
manufacturers
,
for
consumers
and
for
society
as
a
whole
.
(

)
Energy
efficiency
improvement
-
with
one
of
the
available
options
being
more
efficient
end
use
of
electricity
-
is
regarded
as
contributing
substantially
to
the
achievement
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
targets
in
the
Community
.
A
significant
reduction
in
energy
consumption
as
suggested
by
the
Commission
in
its
European
Climate
Change
Programme
(
ECCP
)
is
possible
.
Climate
change
is
one
of
the
priorities
of
the
Sixth
Community
Environment
Action
Programme
,
laid
down
by
Decision
No
1600
/
2002
/
EC
of
the
European
Parliament
and
of
the
Council
[
3
]
.
Energy
saving
is
the
most
cost-effective
way
to
increase
security
of
supply
and
reduce
import
dependency
.
Therefore
,
substantial
demand
side
measures
and
targets
should
be
adopted
.
(
5
)
Action
should
be
taken
during
the
design
phase
of
EUPs
,
since
it
appears
that
the
pollution
caused
during
a
product
's
life
cycle
is
determined
at
that
stage
,
and
most
of
the
costs
involved
are
committed
then
.
(
6
)
A
coherent
framework
for
the
application
of
Community
Ecodesign
requirements
for
EUPs
should
be
established
with
the
aim
of
ensuring
the
free
movement
of
those
products
which
comply
and
of
improving
their
overall
environmental
impact
.
Such
Community
requirements
should
respect
the
principles
of
fair
competition
and
international
trade
.
(
7
)
Ecodesign
requirements
should
be
set
bearing
in
mind
the
goals
and
priorities
of
the
Sixth
Community
Environment
Action
Programme
,
including
as
appropriate
applicable
goals
of
the
relevant
thematic
strategies
of
that
Programme
.
(
8
)
This
Directive
seeks
to
achieve
a
high
level
of
protection
for
the
environment
by
reducing
the
potential
environmental
impact
of
EUPs
,
which
will
ultimately
be
beneficial
to
consumers
and
other
end
-
users
.
Sustainable
development
also
requires
proper
consideration
of
the
health
,
social
and
economic
impact
of
the
measures
envisaged
.
Improving
the
energy
efficiency
of
products
contributes
to
the
security
of
the
energy
supply
,
which
is
a
precondition
of
sound
economic
activity
and
therefore
of
sustainable
development
.

A
Member
State
deeming
it
necessary
to
maintain
national
provisions
on
grounds
of
major
needs
relating
to
the
protection
of
the
environment
,
or
to
introduce
new
ones
based
on
new
scientific
evidence
relating
to
the
protection
of
the
environment
on
grounds
of
a
problem
specific
to
that
member
state
arising
after
the
adoption
of
the
applicable
implementing
measure
,
may
do
so
following
the
conditions
laid
down
in
article
95
(
4
)
,
(
5
)
and
(
6
)
of
the
treaty
,
that
provides
for
a
prior
notification
to
and
approval
from
the
Commission
.
(
10
)
In
order
to
maximise
the
environmental
benefits
from
improved
design
it
may
be
necessary
to
inform
consumers
about
the
environmental
characteristics
and
performance
of
EUPs
and
to
advise
them
about
how
to
use
products
in
a
manner
which
is
environmentally
friendly
.
(
11
)
The
approach
set
out
in
the
Green
Paper
on
Integrated
Product
Policy
,
which
is
a
major
innovative
element
of
the
Sixth
Community
Environment
Action
Programme
,
aims
to
reduce
the
environmental
impacts
of
products
across
the
whole
of
their
life
cycle
.
Considering
at
the
design
stage
a
product
's
environmental
impact
throughout
its
whole
life
cycle
has
a
high
potential
to
facilitate
environmental
improvement
in
a
cost-effective
way
.
There
should
be
sufficient
flexibility
to
enable
this
factor
to
be
integrated
in
product
design
whilst
taking
account
of
technical
,
functional
and
economic
considerations
.
(
12
)
Although
a
comprehensive
approach
to
environmental
performance
is
desirable
,
greenhouse
gas
mitigation
through
increased
energy
efficiency
should
be
considered
a
priority
environmental
goal
pending
the
adoption
of
a
working
plan
.
(
13
)
It
may
be
necessary
and
justified
to
establish
specific
quantified
ecodesign
requirements
for
some
products
or
environmental
aspects
thereof
in
order
to
ensure
that
their
environmental
impact
is
minimised
.
Given
the
urgent
need
to
contribute
to
the
achievement
of
the
commitments
in
the
framework
of
the
Kyoto
Protocol
to
the
United
Nations
Framework
Convention
on
Climate
Change
(
UNFCCC
)
,
and
without
prejudice
to
the
integrated
approach
promoted
in
this
Directive
,
some
priority
should
be
given
to
those
measures
with
a
high
potential
for
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
at
low
cost
.
Such
measures
can
also
contribute
to
a
sustainable
use
of
resources
and
constitute
a
major
contribution
to
the
10
-
year
framework
of
programmes
on
sustainable
production
and
consumption
agreed
at
the
World
Summit
on
Sustainable
Development
in
Johannesburg
in
September
2002
.
(

)
While
the
best
-
performing
products
or
technologies
available
on
the
market
,
including
on
international
markets
,
should
be
taken
as
reference
,
the
level
of
ecodesign
requirements
should
be
established
on
the
basis
of
technical
,
economic
and
environmental
analysis
.
Flexibility
in
the
method
for
establishing
the
level
of
requirements
can
make
swift
improvement
of
environmental
performance
easier
.
Interested
parties
involved
should
be
consulted
and
cooperate
actively
in
this
analysis
.
The
setting
of
mandatory
measures
requires
proper
consultation
of
the
parties
involved
.
Such
consultation
may
highlight
the
need
for
a
phased
introduction
or
transitional
measures
.
The
introduction
of
interim
targets
increases
the
predictability
of
the
policy
,
allows
for
accommodating
product
development
cycles
and
facilitates
long
term
planning
for
interested
parties
.
(
16
)
Priority
should
be
given
to
alternative
courses
of
action
such
as
self-regulation
by
the
industry
where
such
action
is
likely
to
deliver
the
policy
objectives
faster
or
in
a
less
costly
manner
than
mandatory
requirements
.
Legislative
measures
may
be
needed
where
market
forces
fail
to
evolve
in
the
right
direction
or
at
an
acceptable
speed
.
(
18
)
For
the
assessment
of
voluntary
agreements
or
other
self-regulation
measures
presented
as
alternatives
to
implementing
measures
,
information
on
at
least
the
following
issues
should
be
available
:
openness
of
participation
,
added
value
,
representativeness
,
quantified
and
staged
objectives
,
involvement
of
civil
society
,
monitoring
and
reporting
,
cost-effectiveness
of
administering
a
self-regulatory
initiative
,
sustainability
.

Chapter
6
of
the
Commission
's
"
Communication
on
Environmental
Agreements
at
Community
level
within
the
Framework
of
the
Action
Plan
on
the
Simplification
and
Improvement
of
the
Regulatory
Environment
"
could
provide
useful
guidance
when
assessing
self-regulation
by
industry
in
the
context
of
this
Directive
.
(
20
)
This
Directive
should
also
encourage
the
integration
of
Ecodesign
in
small
and
medium-sized
enterprises
(
SMEs
)
and
very
small
firms
.
Such
integration
could
be
facilitated
by
wide
availability
of
and
easy
access
to
information
relating
to
the
sustainability
of
their
products
.
The
rigorous
enforcement
of
implementing
measures
is
necessary
to
reduce
the
environmental
impact
of
regulated
EUPs
and
to
ensure
fair
competition
.
(
22
)
When
preparing
implementing
measures
and
its
working
plan
the
Commission
should
consult
Member
States
'
representatives
as
well
as
interested
parties
concerned
with
the
product
group
,
such
as
industry
,
including
SMEs
and
craft
industry
,
trade
unions
,
traders
,
retailers
,
importers
,
environmental
protection
groups
and
consumer
organisations
.
(
23
)
When
preparing
implementing
measures
,
the
Commission
should
also
take
due
account
of
existing
national
environmental
legislation
,
in
particular
concerning
toxic
substances
,
which
Member
States
have
indicated
that
they
consider
should
be
preserved
,
without
reducing
the
existing
and
justified
levels
of
protection
in
the
Member
States
.

Regard
should
be
given
to
the
modules
and
rules
intended
for
use
in
technical
harmonisation
Directives
set
out
in
Council
Decision
93
/
465
/
EEC
of
22
July
1993
concerning
the
modules
for
the
various
phases
of
the
conformity
assessment
procedures
and
the
rules
for
the
affixing
and
use
of
the
CE
conformity
marking
,
which
are
intended
to
be
used
in
the
technical
harmonisation
Directives
.
(
25
)
Surveillance
authorities
should
exchange
information
on
the
measures
envisaged
within
the
scope
of
this
Directive
with
a
view
to
improving
surveillance
of
the
market
.
Such
cooperation
should
make
the
utmost
use
of
electronic
means
of
communication
and
relevant
Community
programmes
.
ll
The
exchange
of
information
on
environmental
life
cycle
performance
and
on
the
achievements
of
design
solutions
should
be
facilitated
.
The
accumulation
and
dissemination
of
the
body
of
knowledge
generated
by
the
ecodesign
efforts
of
manufacturers
is
one
of
the
crucial
benefits
of
this
Directive
.
(
26
)
A
competent
body
is
usually
a
public
or
private
body
,
designated
by
the
public
authorities
,
and
presenting
the
necessary
guarantees
for
impartiality
and
availability
of
technical
expertise
for
carrying
out
verification
of
the
product
with
regard
to
its
compliance
with
the
applicable
implementing
measures
.
(
27
)
Noting
the
importance
of
avoiding
non
-
compliance
,
Member
States
should
ensure
that
the
necessary
means
are
available
for
effective
market
surveillance
.
(
28
)
In
respect
of
training
and
information
on
ecodesign
for
SMEs
,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
consider
accompanying
activities
.
(
29
)
It
is
in
the
interest
of
the
functioning
of
the
internal
market
to
have
standards
which
have
been
harmonised
at
Community
level
.
Once
the
reference
to
such
a
standard
has
been
published
in
the
Official
Journal
of
the
European
Union
,
compliance
with
it
should
raise
a
presumption
of
conformity
with
the
corresponding
requirements
set
out
in
the
implementing
measure
adopted
on
the
basis
of
this
Directive
,
although
other
means
of
demonstrating
such
conformity
should
be
permitted
.
(
30
)
One
of
the
main
roles
of
harmonised
standards
should
be
to
help
manufacturers
in
applying
the
implementing
measures
adopted
under
this
Directive
.
Such
standards
could
be
essential
in
establishing
measuring
and
testing
methods
.
In
the
case
of
generic
ecodesign
requirements
harmonised
standards
could
contribute
considerably
to
guiding
manufacturers
in
establishing
the
ecological
profile
of
their
products
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
applicable
implementing
measure
.
These
standards
should
clearly
indicate
the
relationship
between
their
clauses
and
the
requirements
dealt
with
.
The
purpose
of
harmonised
standards
should
not
be
to
fix
limits
for
environmental
aspects
.
(
31
)
For
the
purpose
of
definitions
used
in
this
Directive
it
is
useful
to
refer
to
relevant
international
standards
such
as
ISO
14040
(
32
)
.
This
Directive
is
in
accordance
with
certain
principles
for
the
implementation
of
the
new
approach
as
set
out
in
the
Council
Resolution
of
7
May
1985
on
a
new
approach
to
technical
harmonisation
and
standards
and
of
making
reference
to
harmonised
European
standards
.
The
Council
Resolution
of
28
October
1999
on
the
role
of
standardisation
in
Europe
recommended
that
the
Commission
should
examine
whether
the
New
Approach
principle
could
be
extended
to
sectors
not
yet
covered
as
a
means
of
improving
and
simplifying
legislation
wherever
possible
.
(

)
This
Directive
is
complementary
to
existing
Community
instruments
such
as
Council
Directive
92
/
75
/
EEC
of
22
September
1992

provisions
of
the
Member
States
relating
to

use
of
certain
dangerous
substances
and

.
Synergies
between
this
Directive
and
the
existing
Community
instruments
should
contribute
to
increasing
their
respective
impacts
and
building
coherent
requirements
for
manufacturers
to
apply

has
proved
not
to

the
expected
result
,

the
application
of
Council
Decision
amending
and
extending

,
assistance
and
training
programme
for

(
the
"
Pericles
"
programme
)
.
Pericles
,
the
Community
programme
for
exchange
,
assistance
and
training
in
the
protection
of
the
euro
against
counterfeiting
,
was
established
by
Council
Decision
of
17
December
2001
(
2001
/
923
/
EC
)
and
is
designed
to
support
and
supplement
the
measures
undertaken
by
the
Member
States
and
in
existing
programmes
to
protect
the
euro
against
counterfeiting
.
Such
measures
include
information
exchange
(
seminars
,
workshops
,
meetings
and
conferences
)
,
placements
and
exchanges
of
staff
,
as
well
as
technical
,
scientific
and
operational
back-up
.
Article
1
of
the
Pericles
Decision
provides
that
the
programme
shall
run
from
1
January
2002
to
31
December
2005
.
Article
6
of
the
Decision
set
a
reference
amount
of
4
million
euro
for
the
programme
.
Article
13
(
3
)
of
the
Pericles
Decision
provides
that
the
Commission
shall
send
to
the
European
Parliament
and
the
Council
,
by
30
June
2005
:
-
a
report
,
independent
from
the
programme
manager
,
evaluating
the
relevance
,
the
efficiency
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
programme
;
-
a
communication
on
whether
this
programme
should
be
continued
and
adapted
,
accompanied
by
an
appropriate
proposal
.
The
evaluation
report
of
the
Pericles
Programme
was
submitted
on
30
November
2004
.
Since
early
Summer
2003
,
the
number
of
counterfeit
euro
banknotes
detected
in
circulation
has
stabilised
at
about
50000
a
month
,
a
level
below
the
pre
-
euro
levels
,
lower
than
the
US
dollar
and
extremely
low
compared
to
the
nine
billion
genuine
euro
banknotes
in
circulation
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
number
of
counterfeit
euro
coins
is
continuing
to
increase
but
also
remains
low
by
historical
standards
.
In
addition
,
the
police
forces
have
successfully
conducted
a
number
of
operations
to
dismantle
workshops
and
seize
large
numbers
of
counterfeit
banknotes
and
coins
before
they
enter
into
circulation
.
This
overall
favourable
situation
is
the
result
of
a
long
preparation
at
both
legislative
and
institutional
level
and
demonstrates
the
high
level
of
cooperation
achieved
in
EU
and
at
international
level
.
The
Commission
set
out
the
basic
ideas
for
the
protection
of
the
euro
in
a
Communication
it
published
as
early
as
1998
[
1
]
.
And
,
in
1999
Europol
’s
mandate
was
extended
to
include
money
counterfeiting
[
4
]
.
With
regard
to
criminal
sanctions
,
the
Commission
has
published
two
reports
[
5
]
on
the
implementation
of
the
above-mentioned
Framework
Decision
,
which
show
a
satisfactory
level
of
implementation
.
With
a
view
to
ensuring
the
clear
structure
in
the
fight
against
currency
counterfeiting
as
well
as
close
cooperation
and
efficient
flow
of
information
National
Central
Offices
(
NCO
)
were
established
in
all
Member
States
.
Databases
and
communication
systems
are
operating
in
the
ECB
and
Europol
.
Dedicated
bodies
were
created
for
the
technical
analysis
of
counterfeits
in
the
Member
States
,
the
ECB
-
for
banknotes
,
and
the
Commission
-
for
coins
.
The
Pericles
programme
is
playing
a
significant
role
in
achieving
the
present
results
in
the
protection
of
the
euro
and
the
fight
against
the
crime
of
counterfeiting
,
through
the
exchange
of
information
and
the
development
of
cooperation
.
Continuing
vigilance
is
needed
in
order
to
maintain
and
build
on
the
results
currently
achieved
in
the
fight
against
euro
counterfeiting
.
Training
and
technical
assistance
plays
an
important
role
in
this
respect
,
hence
the
need
to
continue
the
Pericles
programme
.
In
line
with
Article
13
of
the
Pericles
Decision
,
the
evaluation
of
the
Pericles
programme
was
assigned
to
the
independent
auditor
of
the
European
Anti
-
Fraud
Office
(
OLAF
)
who
submitted
the
evaluation
report
on
30
November
2004
.
The
evaluator
examined
the
files
of
21
of
the
Pericles
actions
carried
out
until
March
2004
,
on
Member
State
or
Commission
initiative
.
Based
on
questionnaires
to
organisers
and
participants
,
as
well
as
discussions
with
stake
holders
,
he
reached
the
following
main
conclusions
[
6
]
:
-
The
programme
has
improved
awareness
of
the
Community
dimension
of
the
euro
and
has
also
developed
a
greater
understanding
amongst
the
participants
of
the
related
laws
and
instruments
and
in
particular
of
the
relevant
Community
and
broader
European
law
.
-
With
regard
to
the
range
of
information
exchanges
and
methodologies
/
measures
,
most
have
been
presented
in
the
various
workshops
,
meetings
and
seminars
.
-
The
target
groups
for
the
programme
have
been
reached
in
part
with
a
very
high
participation
by
law
enforcement
officials
;
attendance
by
commercial
banking
sector
,
specialist
lawyers
or
chambers
of
commerce
was
not
sufficient
.
-
The
activities
examined
were
considered
relevant
to
and
among
the
main
objectives
of
the
programme
.
-
In
terms
of
costs
,
the
evaluator
found
that
some
of
the
projects
were
particularly
costly
and
highlighted
specific
cost
items
.
The
evaluator
made
the
following
main
recommendations
:
A
second
evaluation
should
take
place
after
four
years
.
-
The
programme
should
continue
to
be
available
to
all
Member
States
but
a
priority
should
be
given
(
in
the
first
instance
)
to
those
with
low
participation
or
who
did
not
organise
actions
in
the
first
programme
,
as
well
as
the
new
Member
States
.
-
Emphasis
should
be
put
on
practical
training
.
There
should
be
a
prioritisation
in
favour
of
staff
exchanges
and
specific
training
,
including
case
studies
.
These
activities
are
also
more
cost
efficient
.
-
Co-operation
between
the
European
institutions
/
bodies
(
Commission
/
OLAF
,
ECB
and
Europol
)
should
be
further
developed
so
as
to
eliminate
any
overlapping
between
different
programmes
and
to
further
improve
the
co-ordination
of
the
main
actors
(
law
enforcement
,
banks
,
prosecutors
)
in
the
fight
against
euro
counterfeiting
.
-
With
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
programme
on
the
convergence
of
high
level
training
for
trainers
,
it
was
not
possible
to
make
an
assessment
as
there
was
not
sufficient
information
on
the
link
between
national
strategies
and
the
activities
under
Pericles
.
-
With
a
view
to
enabling
the
assessment
of
the
effect
of
the
programme
,
among
others
on
the
convergence
of
high
level
training
for
trainers
,
the
evaluator
recommends
the
preparation
of
a
strategy
document
,
to
be
finalised
before
the
new
Pericles
enters
into
effect
.
The
implementation
of
the
Programme
made
a
slow
start
,
mainly
due
to
its
adoption
in
December
2001
.
Thus
,
the
first
project
under
Pericles
was
only
carried
out
in
October
2002
and
the
amount
committed
in
2002
was
just
under
40
%
of
the
initial
budget
allocation
(
the
allocation
was
reviewed
downwards
in
the
course
of
the
year
)
.
Subsequently
,
the
programme
took
off
and
the
budget
allocation
was
completely
committed
in
2003
and
2004
.
Intentions
for
2005
show
that
the
remaining
amount
will
also
be
completely
consumed
.
Based
on
these
statistics
/
forecasts
,
the
overall
level
of
commitments
during
the
period
2002
-
2005
will
reach
80
%
of
the
initial
reference
amount
.
The
main
aggregates
in
the
implementation
of
Pericles
are
shown
on
Table
2
.
In
the
course
of
the
first
three
years
of
the
programme
38
projects
were
initiated
;
for
2005
another
18
actions
are
intended
by
the
Member
States
and
the
Commission
.
Of
the
total
56
projects
,
41
originate
at
the
competent
authorities
of
Member
States
,
while
15
are
an
initiative
of
the
Commission
/
OLAF
.
Most
of
the
actions
carried
out
are
conferences
,
seminars
and
workshops
,
as
well
as
specialised
training
courses
.
Staff
exchange
has
,
nonetheless
,
gained
ground
and
has
now
become
a
standard
feature
of
Pericles
.
Following
enlargement
,
this
type
of
activity
is
likely
to
develop
further
,
which
is
also
in
line
with
the
recommendation
of
the
Pericles
evaluator
.
Only
one
technical
study
was
undertaken
under
the
current
Pericles
,
which
is
planned
to
continue
at
a
broader
level
in
2005
.
The
analysis
of
Pericles
by
type
of
project
is
shown
in
Table
3
.
Almost
2600
persons
participated
in
these
events
.
In
earlier
periods
the
large
majority
of
participants
were
law
enforcement
agents
,
reflecting
the
priority
to
establish
closer
professional
ties
for
a
more
efficient
fight
against
euro
counterfeiting
.
In
that
respect
,
the
evaluation
report
(
p.
10
and
11
)
shows
that
,
until
March
2004
,
65
%
of
participants
were
mainly
from
law
enforcement
agencies
.
As
of
2003
,
a
greater
involvement
of
judiciary
authorities
is
observed
,
while
as
of
2004
and
2005
,
there
is
a
more
pronounced
participation
of
the
financial
sector
(
public
sector
financial
intermediaries
,
National
Central
Banks
,
commercial
banking
and
other
financial
institutions
)
.
This
development
is
in
line
with
the
recommendation
of
the
evaluator
,
while
the
organisation
of
more
technical
seminars
is
also
being
promoted
.
In
terms
of
origin
of
the
participants
,
the
evaluation
report
notes
that
these
came
from
76
countries
,
with
a
majority
from
Member
States
.
It
was
noted
that
some
countries
showed
a
low
level
of
participation
,
among
them
some
of
the
euro
area
countries
.
This
situation
may
reflect
organisational
rather
than
structural
situations
and
an
effort
to
balance
it
is
currently
under
way
.
Some
countries
are
more
active
in
organising
events
,
with
Italy
representing
over
21
%
of
the
total
number
of
activities
.
As
of
2005
,
the
new
Member
States
became
active
in
organising
Pericles
actions
.
As
the
evaluation
report
also
mentions
(
p.
14
)
that
the
organisation
of
Pericles
actions
covered
all
the
areas
relevant
to
the
protection
of
the
euro
:
law
enforcement
,
judicial
,
financial
and
technical
and
promoted
particularly
the
creation
of
networks
useful
for
achieving
greater
efficiency
in
the
fight
against
the
crime
of
counterfeiting
.
Contributions
at
the
Pericles
actions
are
ensured
by
the
ECB
,
the
Commission
,
Europol
and
,
in
some
cases
,
Eurojust
,
Interpol
and
the
US
Secret
Service
.
With
regard
to
the
aspects
of
euro
protection
,
where
the
responsibility
belongs
to
the
Member
States
,
expertise
was
systematically
sought
in
their
specialised
services
.
The
Pericles
actions
take
place
mostly
inside
the
EU
.
However
,
a
number
of
actions
have
been
organised
in
third
or
candidate
countries
,
reflecting
the
specific
needs
to
protect
the
euro
.
Such
is
the
case
with
actions
undertaken
in
Colombia
,
for
all
South
American
countries
and
Bulgaria
,
also
including
other
South
-
Eastern
European
countries
.
As
a
result
,
the
transnationality
and
multidisciplinarity
required
under
Article
3
of
the
Pericles
Decision
have
been
respected
,
with
the
latter
pursued
both
at
the
level
of
professional
background
of
the
participants
and
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
actions
.
In
line
with
Article
5
of
the
Pericles
Decision
,
the
programme
is
implemented
and
coordinated
by
the
Commission
and
the
Member
States
working
closely
together
.
The
coordination
of
the
Pericles
and
other
training
actions
is
carried
out
at
the
Commission
’s
Euro
counterfeiting
experts
group
,
which
brings
together
experts
from
all
member
states
and
candidate
countries
,
with
participation
of
Europol
,
the
ECB
and
Interpol
.
This
is
in
also
line
with
Recital
(
7
)
of
the
Pericles
Decision
.
Pericles
has
now
practically
centralised
Community
level
carried
out
by
the
Commission
and
Member
States
action
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
the
euro
and
has
also
largely
replaced
the
Commission
’s
specific
‘
Protection
of
the
euro
’
budget
line
.
A
small
number
of
actions
geared
on
the
protection
against
currency
counterfeiting
are
carried
out
under
other
Community
programmes
,
such
as
TAIEX
and
Twinning
.
Such
actions
are
mainly
single
-
country
or
single
-
subject
actions
(
i.e.
not
eligible
under
Pericles
)
and
are
systematically
coordinated
with
Pericles
by
the
competent
service
in
the
Commission
in
coordination
with
Member
States
.
In
addition
to
their
awareness
and
training
content
,
the
Pericles
actions
have
led
to
a
number
of
structural
and
other
improvements
in
Member
Sates
and
in
third
countries
.
Among
others
,
National
Central
Offices
for
the
fight
against
counterfeiting
were
created
in
several
countries
;
two
Pericles
seminars
assisted
the
(
then
)
acceding
countries
in
their
efforts
to
apply
the
acquis
in
the
specific
area
;
a
code
of
conduct
was
drawn
with
respect
to
press
and
communication
issues
;
In
line
with
the
above
analysis
and
in
the
light
of
the
conclusions
of
the
evaluator
of
Pericles
,
this
Communication
is
accompanied
by
a
proposal
for
the
adaptation
and
continuation
of
Pericles
.
In
line
with
Article
13
of
Council
Decision
of
17
December
2001
establishing
an
exchange
,
assistance
and
training
programme
for
the
protection
of
the
euro
against
counterfeiting
(
the
‘
Pericles
’
programme
)
and
based
on
the
Pericles
evaluation
report
of
30
November
2004
,
it
is
proposed
that
the
Council
decision
be
extended
and
amended
.
The
proposed
period
for
extension
is
six
years
and
the
reference
amount
unchanged
at
one
million
euro
per
year
.
The
adaptations
proposed
concern
the
increase
of
the
proportion
of
co-financing
by
the
Community
budget
;
the
introduction
of
flexibility
in
the
number
of
applications
by
each
Member
State
and
consequent
coordination
;
and
the
extension
of
the
content
of
the
technical
and
operational
back
-
up
to
administrative
support
for
active
investigations
,
with
intermediation
by
Europol
.
In
line
also
with
the
recommendation
of
the
evaluator
of
Pericles
,
it
is
appropriate
to
extend
the
Pericles
programme
,
based
on
the
need
to
:
-
continue
vigilance
in
order
to
maintain
or
reduce
the
current
level
of
euro
banknote
counterfeiting
and
avoid
any
increase
in
euro
coin
counterfeiting
that
would
undermine
the
confidence
of
the
public
;
-
train
/
inform
new
staff
and
extend
the
training
to
sectors
that
have
less
benefited
from
the
Pericles
programme
,
namely
financial
agents
,
prosecutors
and
technical
staff
;
-
train
relevant
staff
in
the
features
of
the
new
generation
of
the
euro
banknotes
,
to
be
issued
at
the
end
of
this
decade
;
-
particularly
insist
on
training
and
technical
assistance
in
the
new
Member
States
,
with
priority
to
those
who
will
first
introduce
the
euro
as
their
single
currency
.
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
.
Adopted
and
proclaimed
by
General
Assembly
resolution
217
A
(
III
)
of
10
December
1948
.
PREAMBLE
.
Whereas
disregard
and
contempt
for
human
rights
have
resulted
in
barbarous
acts
which
have
outraged
the
conscience
of
mankind
,
and
the
advent
of
a
world
in
which
human
beings
shall
enjoy
freedom
of
speech
and
belief
and
freedom
from
fear
and
want
has
been
proclaimed
as
the
highest
aspiration
of
the
common
people
;
Whereas
it
is
essential
,
if
man
is
not
to
be
compelled
to
have
recourse
,
as
a
last
resort
,
to
rebellion
against
tyranny
and
oppression
,
that
human
rights
should
be
protected
by
the
rule
of
law
;
Whereas
it
is
essential
to
promote
the
development
of
friendly
relations
between
nations
;
Whereas
the
peoples
of
the
United
Nations
have
in
the
Charter
reaffirmed
their
faith
in
fundamental
human
rights
,
in
the
dignity
and
worth
of
the
human
person
and
in
the
equal
rights
of
men
and
women
and
have
determined
to
promote
social
progress
and
better
standards
of
life
in
larger
freedom
;
Whereas
Member
States
have
pledged
themselves
to
achieve
,
in
co
-
operation
with
the
United
Nations
,
the
promotion
of
universal
respect
for
and
observance
of
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
;
Whereas
a
common
understanding
of
these
rights
and
freedoms
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
the
full
realization
of
this
pledge
;
Now
,
therefore
,
The
General
Assembly
Proclaims
this
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
as
a
common
standard
of
achievement
for
all
peoples
and
all
nations
,
to
the
end
that
every
individual
and
every
organ
of
society
,
keeping
this
Declaration
constantly
in
mind
,
shall
strive
by
teaching
and
education
to
promote
respect
for
these
rights
and
freedoms
and
by
progressive
measures
,
national
and
international
,
to
secure
their
universal
and
effective
recognition
and
observance
,
both
among
the
peoples
of
Member
States
themselves
and
among
the
peoples
of
territories
under
their
jurisdiction
.

It
can
be
a
very
complicated
thing
,
the
ocean
.
And
it
can
be
a
very
complicated
thing
,
what
human
health
is
.
And
those
simple
themes
aren't
really
themes
about
the
complex
science
of
what
's
going
on
,
but
things
that
we
all
pretty
well
know
.
And
I
'm
going
to
start
with
this
one
:
We
know
that
,
right
?
We
've
experienced
that
.
That
's
the
theme
of
my
talk
.
And
we
're
making
the
ocean
pretty
unhappy
in
a
lot
of
different
ways
.
This
is
a
shot
of
Cannery
Row
in
1932
.
Cannery
Row
,
at
the
time
,
had
the
biggest
industrial
canning
operation
on
the
west
coast
.
We
piled
enormous
amounts
of
pollution
into
the
air
and
into
the
water
.
Rolf
Bolin
,
who
was
a
professor
at
the
Hopkin
's
Marine
Station
where
I
work
,
wrote
in
the
1940s
that
"
The
fumes
from
the
scum
floating
on
the
inlets
of
the
bay
were
so
bad
they
turned
lead
-
based
paints
black
"
.
They
say
,
"
You
know
what
you
smell
?
"
.
That
pollution
was
money
to
that
community
,
and
those
people
dealt
with
the
pollution
and
absorbed
it
into
their
skin
and
into
their
bodies
because
they
needed
the
money
.
We
made
the
ocean
unhappy
;
we
made
people
very
unhappy
,
and
we
made
them
unhealthy
.
The
pyramid
of
ocean
life
.
We
see
the
base
of
the
food
chain
,
the
plankton
,
the
small
things
,
and
we
see
how
those
animals
are
food
to
animals
in
the
middle
of
the
pyramid
,
and
on
so
up
this
diagram
.
And
that
flow
,
that
flow
of
life
,
from
the
very
base
up
to
the
very
top
,
is
the
flow
that
ecologists
see
.
Now
why
does
that
matter
for
human
health
?
Because
when
we
jam
things
in
the
bottom
of
that
pyramid
that
shouldn't
be
there
,
some
very
frightening
things
happen
.
Now
,
to
bring
that
home
,
I
thought
I
'd
invent
a
little
game
.
We
don't
really
have
to
play
it
;
It
's
the
Styrofoam
and
chocolate
game
.
Imagine
that
when
we
got
on
this
boat
,
we
were
all
given
two
Styrofoam
peanuts
.
What
'll
happen
is
that
the
Styrofoam
peanuts
will
start
moving
through
our
society
here
,
and
they
will
accumulate
in
the
drunkest
,
stingiest
people
.
There
's
no
mechanism
in
this
game
for
them
to
go
anywhere
but
into
a
bigger
and
bigger
pile
of
indigestible
Styrofoam
peanuts
.
And
that
's
exactly
what
happens
with
PCBs
in
this
food
pyramid
:
They
accumulate
into
the
top
of
it
.
Now
suppose
,
instead
of
Styrofoam
peanuts
,
we
take
these
lovely
little
chocolates
that
we
get
and
we
had
those
instead
.
PCBs
accumulate
.
PCBs
accumulate
in
dolphins
in
Sarasota
Bay
,
in
Texas
,
in
North
Carolina
.
They
get
into
the
food
chain
.
The
dolphins
eat
the
fish
that
have
PCBs
from
the
plankton
,
and
those
PCBs
,
being
fat-soluble
,
accumulate
in
these
dolphins
.
Now
,
a
dolphin
,
mother
dolphin
,
any
dolphin
-
there
's
only
one
way
that
a
PCB
can
get
out
of
a
dolphin
.
In
mother
's
milk
.
Here
's
a
diagram
of
the
PCB
load
of
dolphins
in
Sarasota
Bay
.
Females
after
their
first
calf
is
already
weaned
:
Those
females
,
they
're
not
trying
to
.
The
death
rate
in
these
dolphins
,
for
the
first
calf
born
of
every
female
dolphin
,
is
60
to
80
percent
.
Now
,
the
mother
then
can
go
and
reproduce
,
but
what
a
terrible
price
to
pay
for
the
accumulation
of
this
pollutant
in
these
animals
-
the
death
of
the
first
-
born
calf
.
There
's
another
top
predator
in
the
ocean
,
it
turns
out
.
And
we
also
are
eating
meat
that
comes
from
some
of
these
same
places
.
This
is
whale
meat
that
I
photographed
in
a
grocery
store
in
Tokyo
-
or
is
it
?
In
fact
,
what
we
did
a
few
years
ago
was
learn
how
to
smuggle
a
molecular
biology
lab
into
Tokyo
and
use
it
to
genetically
test
the
DNA
out
of
whale
meat
samples
and
identify
what
they
really
were
.
And
some
of
those
whale
meat
samples
were
whale
meat
.
Some
of
them
were
illegal
whale
meat
,
by
the
way
.
That
's
another
story
.
But
some
of
them
were
not
whale
meat
at
all
.
Even
though
they
were
labeled
whale
meat
,
they
were
dolphin
meat
.
Some
of
them
were
dolphin
liver
.
And
those
dolphin
parts
had
a
huge
load
of
PCBs
,
dioxins
and
heavy
metals
.
And
that
huge
load
was
passing
into
the
people
that
ate
this
meat
.
It
turns
out
that
a
lot
of
dolphins
are
being
sold
as
meat
in
the
whale
meat
market
around
the
world
.
That
's
a
tragedy
for
those
populations
,
but
it
's
also
a
tragedy
for
the
people
eating
them
because
they
don't
know
that
that
's
toxic
meat
.
We
had
these
data
a
few
years
ago
.
It
had
two
-
three
-
to
-
400
times
the
toxic
loads
ever
allowed
by
the
EPA
.
And
I
remember
there
sitting
at
my
desk
thinking
,
"
Well
,
I
know
this
"
.
This
is
a
great
scientific
discovery
,
but
it
was
so
awful
.

PRINCETON
–
How
quickly
emerging
markets
'
fortunes
have
turned
.
Not
long
ago
,
they
were
touted
as
the
salvation
of
the
world
economy
–
the
dynamic
engines
of
growth
that
would
take
over
as
the
economies
of
the
United
States
and
Europe
sputtered
.
But
now
the
emerging
-
market
blues
are
back
.
The
beating
that
these
countries
'
currencies
have
taken
as
the
US
Federal
Reserve
begins
to
tighten
monetary
policy
is
just
the
start
;
everywhere
one
looks
,
it
seems
,
there
are
deep-seated
problems
.
Argentina
and
Venezuela
have
run
out
of
heterodox
policy
tricks
.
Brazil
and
India
need
new
growth
models
.
Turkey
and
Thailand
are
mired
in
political
crises
that
reflect
long
-
simmering
domestic
conflicts
.
This
is
not
the
first
time
that
developing
countries
have
been
hit
hard
by
abrupt
mood
swings
in
global
financial
markets
.
The
surprise
is
that
we
are
surprised
.
Economists
,
in
particular
,
should
have
learned
a
few
fundamental
lessons
long
ago
.
First
,
emerging
-
market
hype
is
just
that
.
Instead
,
emerging
markets
'
growth
over
the
last
two
decades
was
based
on
a
fortuitous
(
and
temporary
)
set
of
external
circumstances
:
high
commodity
prices
,
low
interest
rates
,
and
seemingly
endless
buckets
of
foreign
finance
.
Governments
that
enjoyed
the
rollercoaster
ride
on
the
way
up
should
not
have
been
surprised
by
the
plunge
that
inevitably
follows
.
In
theory
,
market
-
determined
currency
values
are
supposed
to
isolate
the
domestic
economy
from
the
vagaries
of
international
finance
,
rising
when
money
floods
in
and
falling
when
the
flows
are
reversed
.
In
reality
,
few
economies
can
bear
the
requisite
currency
alignments
without
pain
.
Floating
exchange
rates
may
moderate
the
adjustment
difficulties
,
but
they
do
not
eliminate
them
.
Fourth
,
faith
in
global
economic
-
policy
coordination
is
misplaced
.
America
's
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
,
for
example
,
will
always
be
driven
by
domestic
considerations
first
(
if
not
second
and
third
as
well
)
.
And
European
countries
can
barely
look
after
their
own
common
interests
,
let
alone
the
world
's
.
For
the
most
part
,
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
.
The
Fed
's
huge
monthly
purchases
of
long-term
assets
–
so-called
quantitative
easing
–
have
benefited
the
world
as
a
whole
by
propping
up
demand
and
economic
activity
in
the
US
.
Without
QE
,
which
the
Fed
is
now
gradually
tapering
,
world
trade
would
have
taken
a
much
bigger
hit
.
Similarly
,
the
rest
of
the
world
will
benefit
when
Europeans
are
able
to
get
their
policies
right
and
boost
their
economies
.
In
the
midst
of
a
foreign
-
capital
bonanza
,
stagnant
levels
of
private
investment
in
tradable
goods
are
a
particularly
powerful
danger
signal
that
no
amount
of
government
mythmaking
should
be
allowed
to
override
.
Officials
face
a
simple
choice
:
maintain
strong
prudential
controls
on
capital
flows
,
or
be
prepared
to
invest
a
large
share
of
resources
in
self
-
insurance
by
accumulating
large
foreign
reserves
.
The
deeper
problem
lies
with
the
excessive
financialization
of
the
global
economy
that
has
occurred
since
the
1990
'
s
.
The
policy
dilemmas
that
have
resulted
–
rising
inequality
,
greater
volatility
,
reduced
room
to
manage
the
real
economy
–
will
continue
to
preoccupy
policymakers
in
the
decades
ahead
.
It
is
true
,
but
unhelpful
,
to
say
that
governments
have
only
themselves
to
blame
for
having
recklessly
rushed
into
this
wild
ride
.
Intellectual
Property
and
Economic
Development
.
WASHINGTON
,
DC
–
In
his
recent
State
of
the
Union
address
,
US
President
Barack
Obama
reiterated
his
ambition
to
complete
the
Trans
-
Pacific
Partnership
,
a
proposed
trade
agreement
among
the
US
and
11
Pacific
countries
.
Meanwhile
,
the
European
Union
and
China
are
pressing
to
close
their
own
deals
in
Asia
and
elsewhere
.
Some
activists
and
government
officials
get
the
relationship
between
strong
IP
protection
and
economic
growth
backwards
,
claiming
that
IP
rights
are
an
obstacle
to
development
,
and
thus
should
not
be
enforced
until
after
countries
achieve
high
-
income
status
.
This
attitude
is
particularly
prevalent
in
India
,
which
recently
put
trade
negotiations
with
the
EU
on
hold
,
and
it
was
central
to
the
failure
of
the
Doha
Round
of
global
trade
talks
.
As
Indian
Commerce
Minister
Anand
Sharma
put
it
,
"
inherent
flexibilities
must
be
provided
to
developing
countries
.
Instead
of
diluting
IP
rights
,
developing
countries
like
India
should
recognize
that
strengthening
IP
protection
is
a
prerequisite
for
attracting
the
foreign
investment
that
they
need
to
help
their
economies
grow
,
create
jobs
,
and
improve
their
citizens
'
capacity
to
consume
.
Today
,
IP
accounts
for
much
of
the
value
at
large
companies
.
One
study
found
that
in
2009
,
across
a
variety
of
industries
in
the
US
,
intellectual
capital
–
patents
,
copyrights
,
databases
,
brands
,
and
organizational
knowledge
–
held
a
44
%
share
of
firms
'
overall
market
value
.
Developing
countries
have
a
lot
to
gain
from
attracting
multinational
firms
.
They
also
spawn
new
local
companies
that
serve
as
suppliers
,
thereby
boosting
employment
,
augmenting
workers
'
skills
,
improving
productivity
,
and
increasing
government
revenue
.
According
to
a
new
study
by
the
economists
Robert
Shapiro
and
Aparna
Mathur
,
if
India
achieved
Chinese
levels
of
IP
protection
,
its
annual
FDI
inflows
would
increase
by
33
%
annually
.
In
the
pharmaceutical
sector
–
which
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
IP
infringement
–
a
stronger
IP
regime
could
increase
FDI
inflows
from
$
1.5
billion
this
year
to
$
8.3
billion
in
2020
,
with
pharmaceutical
R&D
doubling
to
$
1.3
billion
over
the
same
period
.
The
increased
FDI
would
create
18,000
new
jobs
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
.
If
India
could
transform
its
IP
regime
to
resemble
the
US
system
,
which
is
more
robust
than
China
's
,
the
benefits
would
be
even
greater
.
Inward
FDI
could
increase
by
as
much
as
83
%
annually
by
2020
;
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
alone
,
FDI
could
reach
as
much
as
$
77
billion
,
with
R&D
rising
to
$
4.2
billion
and
44,000
new
jobs
being
created
.
The
Indian
government
's
ongoing
assault
on
pharmaceutical
IP
makes
these
findings
even
more
significant
.
Over
the
last
two
years
,
India
has
invalidated
or
otherwise
attacked
patents
on
15
drugs
produced
by
international
firms
in
order
to
make
way
for
local
champions
,
claiming
that
exclusivity
enables
companies
to
charge
high
prices
that
harm
consumers
.
But
drug
patents
and
prices
are
not
the
main
–
or
even
a
major
–
obstacle
to
patients
'
access
to
medical
care
in
India
.
The
bigger
issue
,
as
the
IMS
consultancy
found
last
year
,
is
the
shortage
of
doctors
,
clinics
,
and
hospitals
,
especially
in
rural
areas
.
Even
the
public
clinics
and
hospitals
that
do
exist
are
often
rendered
useless
by
high
rates
of
absenteeism
by
doctors
.
Furthermore
,
Indians
lack
access
to
insurance
programs
,
particularly
for
outpatient
care
.
This
,
coupled
with
the
lack
of
a
public
safety
net
,
makes
health
problems
a
leading
source
of
economic
hardship
,
even
for
middle-class
families
.
Far
from
improving
citizens
'
access
to
health
care
,
weak
IP
protections
are
exacerbating
India
's
formidable
health
-
care
challenges
.
It
is
equally
important
for
trade
negotiators
worldwide
to
reject
the
notion
that
IP
protection
is
a
luxury
that
only
rich
countries
can
afford
.
The
reality
is
that
IP
protection
is
an
economic
engine
that
developing
-
country
citizens
should
not
have
to
forego
.
The
Banks
that
Ate
the
Economy
.
LONDON
–
Bank
of
England
Governor
Mark
Carney
surprised
his
audience
at
a
conference
late
last
year
by
speculating
that
banking
assets
in
London
could
grow
to
more
than
nine
times
Britain
's
GDP
by
2050
.
His
forecast
represented
a
simple
extrapolation
of
two
trends
:
continued
financial
deepening
worldwide
(
that
is
,
faster
growth
of
financial
assets
than
of
the
real
economy
)
,
and
London
's
maintenance
of
its
share
of
the
global
financial
business
.
These
may
be
reasonable
assumptions
,
but
the
estimate
was
deeply
unsettling
to
many
.
Hosting
a
huge
financial
center
,
with
outsize
domestic
banks
,
can
be
costly
to
taxpayers
.
In
Iceland
and
Ireland
,
banks
outgrew
their
governments
'
ability
to
support
them
when
needed
.
The
result
was
disastrous
.
Quite
apart
from
the
potential
bailout
costs
,
some
argue
that
financial
hypertrophy
harms
the
real
economy
by
syphoning
off
talent
and
resources
that
could
better
be
deployed
elsewhere
.
But
Carney
argues
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
rest
of
the
British
economy
benefits
from
having
a
global
financial
center
in
its
midst
.
Being
at
the
heart
of
the
global
financial
system
,
he
said
,
"
broadens
the
investment
opportunities
for
the
institutions
that
look
after
British
savings
,
and
reinforces
the
ability
of
UK
manufacturing
and
creative
industries
to
compete
globally
.
But
it
is
coming
under
fire
.
He
argues
(
in
a
speech
revealingly
entitled
The
Contribution
of
the
Financial
Sector
:
Miracle
or
Mirage
?
"
)
that
the
financial
sector
's
reported
contribution
to
GDP
has
been
significantly
overrated
.
Two
recent
papers
raise
further
doubts
.
In
"
The
Growth
of
Modern
Finance
"
,
Robin
Greenwood
and
David
Scharfstein
of
Harvard
Business
School
show
that
the
share
of
finance
in
US
GDP
almost
doubled
between
1980
and
2006
,
just
before
the
onset
of
the
financial
crisis
,
from
4.9
%
to
8.3
%
.
The
two
main
factors
driving
that
increase
were
the
expansion
of
credit
and
the
rapid
rise
in
resources
devoted
to
asset
management
(
associated
,
not
coincidentally
,
with
the
exponential
growth
in
financial
-
sector
incomes
)
.
Greenwood
and
Scharfstein
argue
that
increased
financialization
was
a
mixed
blessing
.
There
may
have
been
more
savings
opportunities
for
households
and
more
diverse
funding
sources
for
firms
,
but
the
added
value
of
asset
-
management
activity
was
illusory
.
Much
of
it
involved
costly
churning
of
portfolios
,
while
increased
leverage
implied
fragility
for
the
financial
system
as
a
whole
and
imposed
severe
social
costs
as
over
-
exposed
households
subsequently
went
bankrupt
.
Stephen
G.
Cecchetti
and
Enisse
Kharroubi
of
the
Bank
for
International
Settlements
–
the
central
banks
'
central
bank
–
go
further
.
They
argue
that
rapid
financial
-
sector
growth
reduces
productivity
growth
in
other
sectors
.
Using
a
sample
of
20
developed
countries
,
they
find
a
negative
correlation
between
the
financial
sector
's
share
of
GDP
and
the
health
of
the
real
economy
.
But
it
is
clear
that
financial
firms
compete
with
others
for
resources
,
and
especially
for
skilled
labor
.
Physicists
or
engineers
with
doctorates
can
choose
to
develop
complex
mathematical
models
of
market
movements
for
investment
banks
or
hedge
funds
,
where
they
are
known
colloquially
as
"
rocket
scientists
.
Cecchetti
and
Kharroubi
find
evidence
that
it
is
indeed
research
-
intensive
firms
that
suffer
most
when
finance
is
booming
.
And
we
are
not
just
talking
about
the
so-called
"
quants
.
(
Some
might
cynically
say
that
keeping
MBAs
and
economists
out
of
real
businesses
is
a
blessing
,
but
I
doubt
that
that
is
really
true
.
)
The
authors
find
another
intriguing
effect
,
too
.
Periods
of
rapid
growth
in
lending
are
often
associated
with
construction
booms
,
partly
because
real
-
estate
assets
are
relatively
easy
to
post
as
collateral
for
loans
.
But
the
rate
of
productivity
growth
in
construction
is
low
,
and
the
value
of
many
credit
-
fueled
projects
subsequently
turns
out
to
be
low
or
negative
.
So
,
should
Britons
look
forward
with
enthusiasm
to
the
future
sketched
by
Carney
?
Aspiring
derivatives
traders
certainly
will
be
more
confident
of
their
career
prospects
.
And
other
parts
of
the
economy
that
provide
services
to
the
financial
sector
–
Porsche
dealers
and
strip
clubs
,
for
example
–
will
be
similarly
encouraged
.
Sustaining
Ukraine
's
Breakthrough
.
NEW
YORK
–
Following
a
crescendo
of
terrifying
violence
,
the
Ukrainian
uprising
has
had
a
surprisingly
positive
outcome
.
Contrary
to
all
rational
expectations
,
a
group
of
citizens
armed
with
not
much
more
than
sticks
and
shields
made
of
cardboard
boxes
and
metal
garbage
-
can
lids
overwhelmed
a
police
force
firing
live
ammunition
.
There
were
many
casualties
,
but
the
citizens
prevailed
.
This
was
one
of
those
historic
moments
that
leave
a
lasting
imprint
on
a
society
's
collective
memory
.
How
could
such
a
thing
happen
?
Quantum
mechanics
offers
a
fitting
metaphor
.
similarly
,
human
beings
may
behave
both
as
individual
particles
and
as
components
of
a
larger
wave
.
In
other
words
,
the
unpredictability
of
historical
events
like
those
in
Ukraine
has
to
do
with
an
element
of
uncertainty
in
human
identity
.
People
's
identity
is
made
up
of
individual
elements
and
elements
of
larger
units
to
which
they
belong
,
and
peoples
'
impact
on
reality
depends
on
which
elements
dominate
their
behavior
.
When
civilians
launched
a
suicidal
attack
on
an
armed
force
in
Kyiv
on
February
20
,
their
sense
of
representing
"
the
nation
"
far
outweighed
their
concern
with
their
individual
mortality
.
The
result
was
to
swing
a
deeply
divided
society
from
the
verge
of
civil
war
to
an
unprecedented
sense
of
unity
.
Whether
that
unity
endures
will
depend
on
how
Europe
responds
.
Ukrainians
have
demonstrated
their
allegiance
to
a
European
Union
that
is
itself
hopelessly
divided
,
with
the
euro
crisis
pitting
creditor
and
debtor
countries
against
one
another
.
That
is
why
the
EU
was
hopelessly
outmaneuvered
by
Russia
in
the
negotiations
with
Ukraine
over
an
Association
Agreement
.
True
to
form
,
the
EU
under
German
leadership
offered
far
too
little
and
demanded
far
too
much
from
Ukraine
.
Now
,
after
the
Ukrainian
people
's
commitment
to
closer
ties
with
Europe
fueled
a
successful
popular
insurrection
,
the
EU
,
along
with
the
International
Monetary
Fund
,
is
putting
together
a
multibillion
-
dollar
rescue
package
to
save
the
country
from
financial
collapse
.
But
that
will
not
be
sufficient
to
sustain
the
national
unity
that
Ukraine
will
need
in
the
coming
years
.
I
established
the
Renaissance
Foundation
in
Ukraine
in
1990
–
before
the
country
achieved
independence
.
The
foundation
did
not
participate
in
the
recent
uprising
,
but
it
did
serve
as
a
defender
of
those
targeted
by
official
repression
.
The
foundation
is
now
ready
to
support
Ukrainians
'
strongly
felt
desire
to
establish
resilient
democratic
institutions
(
above
all
,
an
independent
and
professional
judiciary
)
.
But
Ukraine
will
need
outside
assistance
that
only
the
EU
can
provide
:
management
expertise
and
access
to
markets
.
In
the
remarkable
transformation
of
Central
Europe
's
economies
in
the
1990
'
s
,
management
expertise
and
market
access
resulted
from
massive
investments
by
German
and
other
EU
-
based
companies
,
which
integrated
local
producers
into
their
global
value
chains
.
Ukraine
,
with
its
high
-
quality
human
capital
and
diversified
economy
,
is
a
potentially
attractive
investment
destination
.
But
realizing
this
potential
requires
improving
the
business
climate
across
the
economy
as
a
whole
and
within
individual
sectors
–
particularly
by
addressing
the
endemic
corruption
and
weak
rule
of
law
that
are
deterring
foreign
and
domestic
investors
alike
.
In
addition
to
encouraging
foreign
direct
investment
,
the
EU
could
provide
support
to
train
local
companies
'
managers
and
help
them
develop
their
business
strategies
,
with
service
providers
remunerated
by
equity
stakes
or
profit
-
sharing
.
An
effective
way
to
roll
out
such
support
to
a
large
number
of
companies
would
be
to
combine
it
with
credit
lines
provided
by
commercial
banks
.
To
encourage
participation
,
the
European
Bank
for
Reconstruction
and
Development
(
EBRD
)
could
invest
in
companies
alongside
foreign
and
local
investors
,
as
it
did
in
Central
Europe
.
Ukraine
would
thus
open
its
domestic
market
to
goods
manufactured
or
assembled
by
European
companies
'
wholly
-
or
partly
-
owned
subsidiaries
,
while
the
EU
would
increase
market
access
for
Ukrainian
companies
and
help
them
integrate
into
global
markets
.
I
hope
and
trust
that
Europe
under
German
leadership
will
rise
to
the
occasion
.
I
have
been
arguing
for
several
years
that
Germany
should
accept
the
responsibilities
and
liabilities
of
its
dominant
position
in
Europe
.
Today
,
Ukraine
needs
a
modern-day
equivalent
of
the
Marshall
Plan
,
by
which
the
United
States
helped
to
reconstruct
Europe
after
World
War
II
.
Germany
ought
to
play
the
same
role
today
as
the
US
did
then
.
I
must
,
however
,
end
with
a
word
of
caution
.
The
Marshall
Plan
did
not
include
the
Soviet
bloc
,
thereby
reinforcing
the
Cold
War
division
of
Europe
.
A
replay
of
the
Cold
War
would
cause
immense
damage
to
both
Russia
and
Europe
,
and
most
of
all
to
Ukraine
,
which
is
situated
between
them
.
Ukraine
depends
on
Russian
gas
,
and
it
needs
access
to
European
markets
for
its
products
;
it
must
have
good
relations
with
both
sides
.
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
must
reach
out
to
President
Vladimir
Putin
to
ensure
that
Russia
is
a
partner
,
not
an
opponent
,
in
the
Ukrainian
renaissance
.

2014
.
China
's
Growth
Puzzle
.
Perceptions
of
resilience
have
given
way
to
fears
of
vulnerability
.
The
US
Federal
Reserve
's
tapering
of
its
unprecedented
liquidity
injections
has
been
an
obvious
and
important
trigger
.
Emerging
economies
that
are
overly
dependent
on
global
capital
flows
–
particularly
India
,
Indonesia
,
Brazil
,
South
Africa
,
and
Turkey
–
are
finding
it
tougher
to
finance
economic
growth
.
In
the
throes
of
crisis
,
generalization
is
the
norm
;
in
the
end
,
however
,
it
pays
to
differentiate
.
Unlike
the
deficit
-
prone
emerging
economies
that
are
now
in
trouble
–
whose
imbalances
are
strikingly
reminiscent
of
those
in
the
Asian
economies
that
were
hit
by
the
late-1990
'
s
financial
crisis
–
China
runs
a
current
-
account
surplus
.
As
a
result
,
there
is
no
risk
of
portfolio
outflows
resulting
from
the
Fed
's
tapering
of
its
monthly
asset
purchases
.
And
,
of
course
,
China
's
outsize
backstop
of
$
3.8
trillion
in
foreign
-
exchange
reserves
provides
ample
insurance
in
the
event
of
intensified
financial
contagion
.
It
is
neither
desirable
nor
feasible
for
China
to
return
to
the
trajectory
of
10
%
annual
growth
that
it
achieved
in
the
three
decades
after
1980
.
Yet
a
superficial
fixation
on
China
's
headline
GDP
growth
persists
,
so
that
a
25
%
deceleration
,
to
a
7
-
8
%
annual
rate
,
is
perceived
as
somehow
heralding
the
end
of
the
modern
world
's
greatest
development
story
.
This
knee
-
jerk
reaction
presumes
that
China
's
current
slowdown
is
but
a
prelude
to
more
growth
disappointments
to
come
–
a
presumption
that
reflects
widespread
and
longstanding
fears
of
a
broad
array
of
disaster
scenarios
,
ranging
from
social
unrest
and
environmental
catastrophes
to
housing
bubbles
and
shadow
-
banking
blow-ups
.
While
these
concerns
should
not
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
,
none
of
them
is
the
source
of
the
current
slowdown
.
Instead
,
lower
growth
rates
are
the
natural
result
of
the
long
-
awaited
rebalancing
of
the
Chinese
economy
.
In
other
words
,
what
we
are
witnessing
is
the
effect
of
a
major
shift
from
hyper
-
growth
led
by
exports
and
investment
(
thanks
to
a
vibrant
manufacturing
sector
)
to
a
model
that
is
much
more
reliant
on
the
slower
but
steadier
growth
dynamic
of
consumer
spending
and
services
.
Indeed
,
in
2013
,
the
Chinese
services
sector
became
the
economy
's
largest
,
surpassing
the
combined
share
of
the
manufacturing
and
construction
sectors
.
The
codependency
construct
is
rooted
in
the
psychopathology
of
human
relationships
whereby
two
partners
,
whether
out
of
need
or
convenience
,
draw
unhealthy
support
from
each
other
.
Ultimately
,
codependency
leads
to
a
loss
of
identity
,
serious
frictions
,
and
often
a
nasty
breakup
–
unless
one
or
both
of
the
partners
becomes
more
self-reliant
and
strikes
out
on
his
or
her
own
.
The
economic
analogue
of
codependency
applies
especially
well
to
the
US
and
China
.
China
's
export
-
led
growth
miracle
would
not
have
started
in
the
1980
'
s
without
the
American
consumer
.
The
US
,
for
its
part
,
relied
on
cheap
goods
made
in
China
to
stretch
hard-pressed
consumers
'
purchasing
power
.
It
also
became
dependent
on
China
's
savings
surplus
to
finance
its
own
savings
shortfall
(
the
world
's
largest
)
,
and
took
advantage
of
China
's
voracious
demand
for
US
Treasury
securities
to
help
fund
massive
budget
deficits
and
subsidize
low
domestic
interest
rates
.
Frictions
between
the
two
partners
have
developed
over
a
wide
range
of
issues
,
including
trade
,
the
renminbi
's
exchange
rate
,
regional
security
,
intellectual
property
,
and
cyber
attacks
,
among
others
.
And
,
just
as
a
psychologist
would
predict
,
one
of
the
partners
,
China
,
has
decided
to
go
its
own
way
.
China
's
rebalancing
will
enable
it
to
absorb
its
surplus
savings
,
which
will
be
put
to
work
building
a
social
safety
net
and
boosting
Chinese
households
'
wherewithal
.
As
a
result
,
China
will
no
longer
be
inclined
to
lend
its
capital
to
the
US
.
For
a
growth
-
starved
US
economy
,
the
transformation
of
its
codependent
partner
could
well
be
a
fork
in
the
road
.
One
path
is
quite
risky
:
The
other
path
holds
great
opportunity
:
In
doing
so
,
the
US
could
draw
support
from
exports
,
especially
to
a
rebalanced
China
–
currently
its
third
-
largest
and
fastest
-
growing
major
export
market
.
Compared
with
other
emerging
economies
,
China
is
cut
from
a
different
cloth
.
China
emerged
from
the
late-1990
'
s
Asian
financial
crisis
as
the
region
's
most
resilient
economy
,
and
I
suspect
the
same
will
be
true
this
time
.

CAMBRIDGE
–
The
promise
that
each
generation
will
be
better
off
than
the
last
is
a
fundamental
tenet
of
modern
society
.
By
and
large
,
most
advanced
economies
have
fulfilled
this
promise
,
with
living
standards
rising
over
recent
generations
,
despite
setbacks
from
wars
and
financial
crises
.
In
the
developing
world
,
too
,
the
vast
majority
of
people
have
started
to
experience
sustained
improvement
in
living
standards
and
are
rapidly
developing
similar
growth
expectations
.
But
will
future
generations
,
particularly
in
advanced
economies
,
realize
such
expectations
?
So
far
,
every
prediction
in
the
modern
era
that
mankind
's
lot
will
worsen
,
from
Thomas
Malthus
to
Karl
Marx
,
has
turned
out
to
be
spectacularly
wrong
.
Technological
progress
has
trumped
obstacles
to
economic
growth
.
Periodic
political
rebalancing
,
sometimes
peaceful
,
sometimes
not
,
has
ensured
that
the
vast
majority
of
people
have
benefited
,
albeit
some
far
more
than
others
.
As
a
result
,
Malthus
's
concerns
about
mass
starvation
have
failed
to
materialize
in
any
peaceful
capitalist
economy
.
And
,
despite
a
disconcerting
fall
in
labor
's
share
of
income
in
recent
decades
,
the
long-run
picture
still
defies
Marx
's
prediction
that
capitalism
would
prove
immiserating
for
workers
.
Living
standards
around
the
world
continue
to
rise
.
But
past
growth
performance
is
no
guarantee
that
a
broadly
similar
trajectory
can
be
maintained
throughout
this
century
.
Leaving
aside
potential
geopolitical
disruptions
,
there
are
some
formidable
challenges
to
overcome
,
mostly
stemming
from
political
underperformance
and
dysfunction
.
The
first
set
of
issues
includes
slow
-
burn
problems
involving
externalities
,
the
leading
example
being
environmental
degradation
.
When
property
rights
are
ill-defined
,
as
in
the
case
of
air
and
water
,
government
must
step
in
to
provide
appropriate
Regulation
.
I
do
not
envy
future
generations
for
having
to
address
the
possible
ramifications
of
global
warming
and
fresh
-
water
depletion
.
A
second
set
of
problems
concerns
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
economic
system
is
perceived
as
fundamentally
fair
,
which
is
the
key
to
its
political
sustainability
.
Inequality
can
corrupt
and
paralyze
a
country
's
political
system
–
and
economic
growth
along
with
it
.
The
third
problem
is
that
of
aging
populations
,
an
issue
that
would
pose
tough
challenges
even
for
the
best
-
designed
political
system
.
Soaring
public
debts
surely
exacerbate
the
problem
,
because
future
generations
are
being
asked
both
to
service
our
debt
and
to
pay
for
our
retirements
.
The
final
challenge
concerns
a
wide
array
of
issues
that
require
Regulation
of
rapidly
evolving
technologies
by
governments
that
do
not
necessarily
have
the
competence
or
resources
to
do
so
effectively
.
We
have
already
seen
where
poor
Regulation
of
rapidly
evolving
financial
markets
can
lead
.
There
are
parallel
shortcomings
in
many
other
markets
.
A
leading
example
is
food
supply
–
an
area
where
technology
has
continually
produced
ever
-
more
highly
processed
and
genetically
refined
food
that
scientists
are
only
beginning
to
assess
.
What
is
known
so
far
is
that
childhood
obesity
has
become
an
epidemic
in
many
countries
,
with
an
alarming
rise
in
rates
of
type
2
diabetes
and
coronary
disease
implying
a
significant
negative
impact
on
life
expectancy
in
future
generations
.
Many
leading
health
researchers
,
including
Kelly
Brownell
,
David
Ludwig
,
and
Walter
Willett
,
have
documented
these
problems
.
Government
interventions
to
date
,
mainly
in
the
form
of
enhanced
education
,
have
proved
largely
ineffective
.
Self-destructive
addiction
to
processed
foods
,
which
economists
would
describe
as
an
"
internality
"
,
can
lower
quality
of
life
for
those
afflicted
,
and
can
eventually
lead
to
externalities
for
society
,
such
as
higher
health
-
care
costs
.
Again
,
despite
a
rising
chorus
of
concern
from
researchers
,
political
markets
have
seemed
frozen
.
Addressing
inequality
requires
greater
redistribution
through
national
tax
systems
,
together
with
enhanced
programs
for
adult
education
,
presumably
making
heavy
use
of
new
technologies
.
The
negative
effects
of
falling
population
growth
can
be
mitigated
by
easing
restrictions
on
international
migration
,
and
by
encouraging
more
women
and
retirees
to
enter
or
stay
in
the
workforce
.
But
how
long
it
will
take
for
governments
to
act
is
a
wide-open
question
.
Capitalist
economies
have
been
spectacularly
efficient
at
enabling
growing
consumption
of
private
goods
,
at
least
over
the
long
run
.
When
it
comes
to
public
goods
–
such
as
education
,
the
environment
,
health
care
,
and
equal
opportunity
–
the
record
is
not
quite
as
impressive
,
and
the
political
obstacles
to
improvement
have
seemed
to
grow
as
capitalist
economies
have
matured
.
Will
each
future
generation
continue
to
enjoy
a
better
quality
of
life
than
its
immediate
predecessor
?
In
developing
countries
that
have
not
yet
reached
the
technological
frontier
,
the
answer
is
almost
certainly
yes
.
The
Innovation
Enigma
.
NEW
YORK
–
Around
the
world
,
there
is
enormous
enthusiasm
for
the
type
of
technological
innovation
symbolized
by
Silicon
Valley
.
In
this
view
,
America
's
ingenuity
represents
its
true
comparative
advantage
,
which
others
strive
to
imitate
.
But
there
is
a
puzzle
:
it
is
difficult
to
detect
the
benefits
of
this
innovation
in
GDP
statistics
.
What
is
happening
today
is
analogous
to
developments
a
few
decades
ago
,
early
in
the
era
of
personal
computers
.
In
1987
,
economist
Robert
Solow
–
awarded
the
Nobel
Prize
for
his
pioneering
work
on
growth
–
lamented
that
"
You
can
see
the
computer
age
everywhere
but
in
the
productivity
statistics
.
Perhaps
GDP
does
not
really
capture
the
improvements
in
living
standards
that
computer
-
age
innovation
is
engendering
.
As
it
turns
out
,
there
is
some
truth
in
both
perspectives
.
Recall
how
a
few
years
ago
,
just
before
the
collapse
of
Lehman
Brothers
,
the
financial
sector
prided
itself
on
its
innovativeness
.
Given
that
financial
institutions
had
been
attracting
the
best
and
brightest
from
around
the
world
,
one
would
have
expected
nothing
less
.
But
,
upon
closer
inspection
,
it
became
clear
that
most
of
this
innovation
involved
devising
better
ways
of
scamming
others
,
manipulating
markets
without
getting
caught
(
at
least
for
a
long
time
)
,
and
exploiting
market
power
.
In
this
period
,
when
resources
flowed
to
this
"
innovative
"
sector
,
GDP
growth
was
markedly
lower
than
it
was
before
.
Even
in
the
best
of
times
,
it
did
not
lead
to
an
increase
in
living
standards
(
except
for
the
bankers
)
,
and
it
eventually
led
to
the
crisis
from
which
we
are
only
now
recovering
.
The
net
social
contribution
of
all
of
this
"
innovation
"
was
negative
.
Similarly
,
the
dot-com
bubble
that
preceded
this
period
was
marked
by
innovation
–
Web
sites
through
which
one
could
order
dog
food
and
soft
drinks
online
.
At
least
this
era
left
a
legacy
of
efficient
search
engines
and
a
fiber-optic
infrastructure
.
But
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
assess
how
the
time
savings
implied
by
online
shopping
,
or
the
cost
savings
that
might
result
from
increased
competition
(
owing
to
greater
ease
of
price
comparison
online
)
,
affects
our
standard
of
living
.
Two
things
should
be
clear
.
First
,
the
profitability
of
an
innovation
may
not
be
a
good
measure
of
its
net
contribution
to
our
standard
of
living
.
In
our
winner
-
takes
-
all
economy
,
an
innovator
who
develops
a
better
Web
site
for
online
dog
-
food
purchases
and
deliveries
may
attract
everyone
around
the
world
who
uses
the
Internet
to
order
dog
food
,
making
enormous
profits
in
the
process
.
But
without
the
delivery
service
,
much
of
those
profits
simply
would
have
gone
to
others
.
The
Web
site
's
net
contribution
to
economic
growth
may
in
fact
be
relatively
small
.
Moreover
,
if
an
innovation
,
such
as
ATMs
in
banking
,
leads
to
increased
unemployment
,
none
of
the
social
cost
–
neither
the
suffering
of
those
who
are
laid
off
nor
the
increased
fiscal
cost
of
paying
them
unemployment
benefits
–
is
reflected
in
firms
'
profitability
.
Likewise
,
our
GDP
metric
does
not
reflect
the
cost
of
the
increased
insecurity
individuals
may
feel
with
the
increased
risk
of
a
loss
of
a
job
.
Equally
important
,
it
often
does
not
accurately
reflect
the
improvement
in
societal
wellbeing
resulting
from
innovation
.
In
a
simpler
world
,
where
innovation
simply
meant
lowering
the
cost
of
production
of
,
say
,
an
automobile
,
it
was
easy
to
assess
an
innovation
's
value
.
And
this
is
even
more
apparent
in
other
arenas
:
How
do
we
accurately
assess
the
fact
that
,
owing
to
medical
progress
,
heart
surgery
is
more
likely
to
be
successful
now
than
in
the
past
,
leading
to
a
significant
increase
in
life
expectancy
and
quality
of
life
?
Still
,
one
cannot
avoid
the
uneasy
feeling
that
,
when
all
is
said
and
done
,
the
contribution
of
recent
technological
innovations
to
long-term
growth
in
living
standards
may
be
substantially
less
than
the
enthusiasts
claim
.
A
lot
of
intellectual
effort
has
been
devoted
to
devising
better
ways
of
maximizing
advertising
and
marketing
budgets
–
targeting
customers
,
especially
the
affluent
,
who
might
actually
buy
the
product
.
But
standards
of
living
might
have
been
raised
even
more
if
all
of
this
innovative
talent
had
been
allocated
to
more
fundamental
research
–
or
even
to
more
applied
research
that
could
have
led
to
new
products
.
Yes
,
being
better
connected
with
each
other
,
through
Facebook
or
Twitter
,
is
valuable
.
But
how
can
we
compare
these
innovations
with
those
like
the
laser
,
the
transistor
,
the
Turing
machine
,
and
the
mapping
of
the
human
genome
,
each
of
which
has
led
to
a
flood
of
transformative
products
?
Of
course
,
there
are
grounds
for
a
sigh
of
relief
.
Although
we
may
not
know
how
much
recent
technological
innovations
are
contributing
to
our
wellbeing
,
at
least
we
know
that
,
unlike
the
wave
of
financial
innovations
that
marked
the
pre
-
crisis
global
economy
,
the
effect
is
positive
.
The
Maternal
Thread
of
Life
.
ISLAMABAD
–
Last
month
,
Oxford
University
's
Green
Templeton
College
held
its
annual
Emerging
Markets
Symposium
at
Egrove
Park
.
The
theme
this
year
was
"
Maternal
and
Child
Health
and
Nutrition
.
"
The
final
slide
of
the
opening
presentation
,
delivered
by
GTC
fellow
Stephen
Kennedy
,
was
a
cartoon
depicting
two
young
contestants
set
to
begin
a
race
:
one
was
strong
and
healthy
,
while
the
other
was
emaciated
,
shackled
,
carrying
the
baggage
of
disease
,
and
confronting
the
massive
barrier
of
malnutrition
.
The
message
was
clear
:
not
everyone
begins
life
with
the
same
chance
of
success
.
Of
course
,
this
is
not
a
groundbreaking
insight
.
The
impact
of
factors
like
poverty
,
maternal
literacy
,
sanitation
,
and
housing
conditions
on
children
's
health
–
and
,
in
turn
,
on
social
and
economic
outcomes
–
is
well
documented
.
The
problem
is
that
these
factors
are
not
amenable
to
isolated
public
-
health
interventions
.
But
another
,
less
widely
discussed
social
determinant
–
maternal
nutrition
–
could
be
.
Since
Hippocrates
,
people
have
been
discussing
how
"
nature
"
and
"
nurture
"
interact
to
shape
a
person
's
development
.
Indeed
,
even
in
ancient
civilizations
,
adequate
maternal
nutrition
was
considered
essential
to
ensuring
future
generations
'
survival
and
prosperity
.
But
poverty
and
ignorance
can
thwart
even
the
best
intentions
.
The
consequences
of
maternal
malnutrition
are
far
-
reaching
,
including
higher
child
-
mortality
rates
,
more
birth
defects
,
increased
susceptibility
to
infection
,
and
specific
nutritional
deficiencies
that
can
lock
a
child
into
a
vicious
cycle
of
poor
health
early
in
life
.
Moreover
,
intrauterine
malnutrition
can
increase
the
risk
of
chronic
conditions
like
obesity
,
diabetes
,
and
cardiovascular
disease
during
adulthood
.
They
were
surprised
by
evidence
that
babies
grow
in
the
same
way
worldwide
,
as
long
as
they
receive
the
same
care
and
are
not
constrained
by
environmental
factors
–
evidence
that
challenged
the
widely
held
notion
that
ethnicity
and
gender
are
major
determinants
of
a
child
's
development
.
In
fact
,
upon
hearing
the
evidence
,
a
former
Pakistani
prime
minister
confessed
that
he
would
have
been
more
proactive
in
this
area
had
he
known
while
he
was
in
office
what
he
knows
now
.
The
meeting
's
participants
agreed
that
strong
efforts
to
support
pre
-
conception
care
in
the
context
of
maternal
-
and
child
-
health
services
were
vital
.
After
all
,
if
an
adequately
nourished
mother
provides
critical
health
benefits
to
her
offspring
throughout
their
lives
,
women
can
be
viewed
as
the
custodians
of
future
generations
'
health
.
These
inter
-
generational
biological
connections
are
particularly
pronounced
in
the
case
of
female
children
.
The
influence
of
the
levels
and
composition
of
maternal
nutrition
on
a
female
fetus
will
carry
through
to
adulthood
,
when
she
,
too
,
becomes
a
mother
.
Given
how
few
scientists
have
recognized
the
extent
to
which
a
woman
's
eggs
shape
her
grandchildren
's
prospects
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
policymakers
remain
so
oblivious
to
the
long-term
impact
of
women
's
health
.
But
the
evidence
is
clear
,
and
it
demands
action
.
The
good
news
is
that
there
are
solutions
.
Conditional
cash
transfers
,
text
-
message
-
based
initiatives
,
school
-
based
food
programs
,
vitamin
-
fortification
schemes
,
and
local
leadership
have
all
proved
effective
in
improving
maternal
nutrition
.
Such
initiatives
should
be
backed
by
policies
that
foster
positive
nutritional
choices
.
Compelling
policymakers
to
implement
such
policies
will
require
a
new
set
of
skills
that
draws
upon
lessons
from
around
the
world
.
In
Brazil
,
a
television
program
on
the
role
that
folic
-
acid
supplementation
could
play
in
the
prevention
of
spina
bifida
(
a
congenital
neural
tube
defect
)
immediately
grabbed
politicians
'
attention
.
Initiatives
aimed
at
enhancing
the
public
's
knowledge
of
nutrition
are
also
crucial
–
not
least
because
they
can
motivate
citizens
to
pressure
their
governments
to
take
action
.
To
this
end
,
entertainment
media
like
soap
operas
,
which
have
emerged
as
important
tools
for
empowering
women
in
conservative
Middle
Eastern
societies
,
could
be
employed
.
Forums
like
the
Emerging
Market
Symposium
can
help
to
bridge
the
increasingly
obvious
gap
between
science
and
public
policy
.
But
,
without
strong
domestic
support
for
change
,
the
impact
of
such
meetings
is
limited
.
It
is
time
to
demand
action
–
and
past
time
for
policymakers
to
deliver
it
.
MAR

2014

South
Korea
's
Feminine
Future
.
Over
the
last
half
-
century
,
South
Korea
has
made
considerable
economic
progress
,
with
per
capita
income
increasing
from
a
mere
$
80
dollars
in
1960
to
more
than
$
22,000
last
year
.
But
its
potential
for
sustained
growth
is
faltering
,
owing
to
the
imminent
decline
of
its
working
-
age
population
–
projected
to
fall
by
25
%
by
2050
–
and
rising
competition
from
China
and
other
emerging
economies
.
In
order
to
improve
its
prospects
,
South
Korea
must
pursue
economic
reform
and
restructuring
,
with
an
emphasis
on
maximizing
its
human
-
capital
resources
–
especially
women
.
South
Korea
's
success
over
the
last
five
decades
owes
much
to
the
rapid
growth
of
its
well
-
educated
labor
force
.
From
1960
to
2010
,
the
share
of
adults
with
a
secondary
education
soared
from
20
%
to
an
impressive
87
%
.
By
boosting
productivity
,
increasing
returns
on
investment
,
and
facilitating
technological
adaption
and
innovation
,
South
Korea
's
abundance
of
well
-
educated
workers
has
served
as
the
foundation
for
its
export
-
oriented
development
strategy
.
But
women
remain
underutilized
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
entire
economy
.
Indeed
,
any
effective
South
Korean
growth
strategy
must
create
more
and
better
economic
opportunities
for
women
,
in
part
by
establishing
more
accommodating
working
environments
and
instituting
a
more
diverse
and
flexible
education
system
.
To
its
credit
,
South
Korea
has
built
a
relatively
gender
-
equal
society
.
The
country
elected
its
first
female
President
,
Park
Geun
-
hye
,
in
2012
.
But
a
significant
gender
gap
remains
in
terms
of
the
return
on
human
capital
.
According
to
OECD
data
,
only
55
%
of
South
Korean
women
aged
15
-
64
are
in
the
labor
force
,
compared
to
an
average
of
65
%
in
the
advanced
economies
.
South
Korea
's
male
labor
-
force
participation
rate
,
by
contrast
,
stands
at
about
77
%
–
close
to
the
OECD
average
of
79
%
.
The
labor
-
participation
rate
for
women
with
post
-
secondary
education
is
64
%
,
far
exceeding
the
35
%
rate
for
those
with
only
a
primary
or
middle
-
school
education
.
But
,
even
for
South
Korea
's
most
highly
educated
and
capable
female
workers
,
child
rearing
is
a
major
career
obstacle
.
In
fact
,
South
Korean
women
participate
in
the
labor
force
at
roughly
the
average
rate
for
the
OECD
while
they
are
in
their
late
twenties
.
The
problem
is
that
the
rate
drops
sharply
from
71
%
to
57
%
among
women
in
their
30
'
s
,
as
inflexible
working
environments
and
a
lack
of
affordable
childcare
undermine
their
ability
to
continue
investing
in
their
careers
.
The
good
news
is
that
Park
's
government
is
working
to
change
this
.
But
it
is
less
clear
how
the
government
will
create
additional
jobs
for
women
.
It
could
,
for
example
,
split
full-time
jobs
into
multiple
part-time
positions
,
and
offer
incentives
for
workers
to
reduce
their
hours
.
But
,
given
that
South
Korea
's
workforce
already
includes
a
substantial
share
of
non
-
regular
workers
,
increasing
temporary
employment
may
not
contribute
to
economic
growth
.
A
better
approach
would
entail
creating
high
-
quality
jobs
in
modern
service
industries
.
As
it
stands
,
while
the
services
sector
accounts
for
more
than
70
%
of
employment
in
South
Korea
,
its
productivity
-
growth
rate
remains
much
lower
than
that
of
the
manufacturing
sector
.
Too
many
people
are
working
in
traditional
,
low
-
productivity
service
industries
,
such
as
wholesale
,
retail
trade
,
and
restaurants
,
leaving
modern
,
high
-
productivity
services
like
communications
,
health
,
financial
intermediation
,
and
business
services
underdeveloped
.
It
is
also
important
to
narrow
the
mismatch
between
women
's
abilities
and
their
career
paths
.
The
current
system
tends
to
reinforce
gender
roles
,
encouraging
children
to
follow
culturally
framed
paths
,
instead
of
nurturing
their
individual
interests
and
potential
.
For
example
,
female
university
students
are
much
more
likely
to
study
humanities
than
the
so-called
"
STEM
"
subjects
(
science
,
technology
,
engineering
,
and
mathematics
)
–
key
drivers
of
productivity
gains
,
innovation
,
and
economic
growth
.
Efforts
by
primary
and
secondary
schools
could
help
to
foster
more
diverse
interests
among
female
students
,
giving
talented
young
women
the
tools
they
need
to
make
important
contributions
to
key
economic
sectors
.
Of
course
,
the
potential
of
educated
,
empowered
women
to
drive
sustained
economic
growth
is
not
limited
to
South
Korea
.
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Shinzo
Abe
,
too
,
has
identified
increased
female
labor
-
force
participation
as
critical
to
efforts
to
revive
his
country
's
long
-
dormant
economy
.
Closing
Africa
's
Agricultural
Gender
Gap
.
SEATTLE
–
Africa
's
GDP
is
now
growing
faster
than
any
other
continent
's
.
When
many
people
think
about
the
engines
driving
that
growth
,
they
imagine
commodities
like
oil
,
gold
,
and
cocoa
,
or
maybe
industries
like
banking
and
telecommunications
.
I
think
of
a
woman
named
Joyce
Sandir
.
Joyce
is
a
farmer
who
grows
bananas
,
vegetables
,
and
maize
on
a
small
plot
of
land
in
rural
Tanzania
.
When
I
met
her
in
2012
,
she
had
just
harvested
her
first
crop
of
maize
grown
from
a
seed
specifically
adapted
for
Tanzania
's
climate
.
As
Joyce
's
story
demonstrates
,
agriculture
is
crucial
to
Africa
's
future
.
Research
shows
that
increasing
agricultural
productivity
is
the
most
effective
way
to
reduce
poverty
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
.
In
fact
,
agriculture
offers
the
continent
its
best
opportunity
to
turn
a
vicious
cycle
of
poverty
into
a
virtuous
cycle
of
development
.
That
is
why
leaders
and
policymakers
from
across
the
continent
have
declared
2014
Africa
's
Year
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Security
.
Joyce
's
story
is
relevant
for
another
reason
,
too
.
She
is
important
to
Africa
's
future
not
only
because
she
is
a
farmer
,
but
also
because
she
is
a
woman
.
The
world
has
had
evidence
of
this
gender
gap
since
at
least
2011
,
but
only
limited
data
about
its
scope
,
shape
,
and
causes
.
To
help
us
better
understand
the
problem
,
the
World
Bank
and
the
ONE
Campaign
recently
conducted
an
unprecedented
analysis
of
the
challenges
facing
women
farmers
.
Their
report
highlights
one
stark
fact
from
the
start
:
The
gender
gap
is
real
,
and
in
some
cases
it
is
extreme
.
When
we
compare
male
and
female
farmers
with
similar
land
sizes
across
similar
settings
,
the
productivity
gap
can
be
as
high
as
66
%
,
as
it
is
in
Niger
.
Previously
,
experts
believed
that
women
's
farms
produced
less
because
women
have
less
access
to
inputs
like
fertilizer
,
water
,
and
even
information
.
But
we
now
know
that
the
story
is
much
more
complicated
.
With
the
new
data
in
hand
,
we
can
see
that
,
surprisingly
,
the
productivity
gap
persists
even
when
women
have
equal
access
to
inputs
.
The
precise
reasons
vary
from
country
to
country
–
but
many
of
them
stem
from
entrenched
cultural
norms
that
prevent
women
from
reaching
their
full
potential
.
For
example
,
the
report
found
that
women
face
obstacles
mobilizing
the
labor
they
need
to
help
their
farms
flourish
.
Women
usually
have
more
childcare
and
household
responsibilities
than
men
,
which
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
devote
as
much
time
to
farm
work
,
or
even
to
supervise
hired
labor
.
The
problem
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
women
are
also
likely
to
have
less
income
to
hire
laborers
in
the
first
place
.
In
some
places
,
that
may
mean
teaching
agricultural
extension
workers
how
to
make
their
messages
more
relevant
to
female
audiences
,
or
encouraging
them
to
visit
when
women
are
most
likely
to
be
at
home
.
In
other
places
,
it
may
mean
increasing
women
's
access
to
markets
,
or
introducing
labor
-
saving
tools
to
help
them
get
the
highest
yield
from
their
land
.
It
may
also
require
establishing
community
childcare
centers
,
so
that
women
farmers
have
the
option
to
spend
more
time
farming
.
In
every
case
,
it
will
require
African
policymakers
to
start
recognizing
women
farmers
as
the
essential
economic
partners
that
they
are
.
This
June
,
leaders
from
all
over
Africa
will
meet
in
Malabo
,
Equatorial
Guinea
,
to
set
the
agenda
for
agricultural
policy
in
the
next
decade
.
If
Africa
's
agricultural
sector
is
to
achieve
its
promise
–
and
if
Africa
's
economic
growth
is
to
continue
–
policymakers
should
take
into
account
the
needs
of
farmers
like
Joyce
.
The
Importance
of
Being
Boring
.
WASHINGTON
,
DC
–
The
International
Monetary
Fund
is
an
immensely
useful
organization
,
able
to
deliver
substantial
amounts
of
financial
and
technical
assistance
at
short
notice
to
almost
any
place
in
the
world
.
It
also
has
the
great
advantage
of
almost
always
being
perceived
as
incredibly
boring
.
Unfortunately
for
the
IMF
,
it
now
needs
a
slightly
higher
public
profile
to
convince
the
US
Congress
to
agree
to
some
important
reforms
.
The
Ukrainian
crisis
may
prove
helpful
,
though
that
appears
less
likely
now
–
which
may
be
a
good
thing
to
the
extent
that
one
unintended
consequence
could
be
a
loan
to
Ukraine
that
is
larger
than
it
really
needs
.
From
1918
to
1939
,
international
economic
cooperation
was
hard
to
come
by
–
in
large
part
because
all
of
the
attempted
deals
were
put
together
at
high
-
profile
international
conferences
.
Following
the
creation
of
the
IMF
in
1944
,
many
of
the
same
decisions
became
routine
,
a
lot
less
interesting
,
and
much
easier
to
implement
.
The
IMF
rarely
makes
front
-
page
headlines
in
the
United
States
or
other
big
countries
,
except
when
there
is
a
racy
personal
dimension
.
The
last
time
that
many
read
a
news
story
about
the
Fund
may
have
been
when
then
-
Managing
Director
Dominique
Strauss
Kahn
was
forced
out
in
May
2011
,
following
accusations
that
he
sexually
assaulted
an
employee
in
a
New
York
hotel
.
Since
then
,
his
successor
,
Christine
Lagarde
,
has
helped
to
restore
the
Fund
's
reputation
–
and
to
return
coverage
of
its
programs
and
activities
to
newspapers
'
dry
and
unemotional
business
sections
.
(
When
I
worked
at
the
IMF
in
the
2000
'
s
,
page
-
three
coverage
of
our
events
by
leading
newspapers
was
typically
viewed
as
preferable
to
top
billing
)
.
Of
course
,
in
countries
receiving
assistance
–
such
as
Greece
in
the
last
few
years
–
the
IMF
excites
great
passion
.
But
in
the
halls
of
the
US
Congress
,
few
people
pay
any
attention
.
In
the
highly
charged
partisan
atmosphere
of
Washington
,
DC
,
this
is
without
question
almost
always
an
advantage
.
Imagine
if
the
disbursement
of
all
assistance
to
countries
in
trouble
required
Congressional
approval
,
let
alone
spending
from
the
US
budget
.
The
reality
is
that
it
stands
for
and
operationalizes
US
power
,
in
cooperation
with
America
's
closest
allies
.
Anyone
who
doubts
that
should
review
a
recent
letter
orchestrated
by
the
Bretton
Woods
Committee
,
addressed
to
Congressional
leaders
on
behalf
of
an
impressive
array
of
former
Republican
and
Democratic
cabinet
secretaries
.
Given
the
Fund
's
origins
in
helping
to
rebuild
Europe
after
World
War
II
,
European
countries
are
also
very
well
represented
on
its
executive
board
and
in
terms
of
ownership
shares
(
and
thus
voting
weight
on
important
decisions
)
.
One
major
goal
in
recent
decades
has
been
to
shift
representation
at
the
IMF
somewhat
away
from
Europe
and
toward
the
world
's
emerging
markets
.
(
For
the
technical
details
,
I
recommend
a
recent
paper
by
Edwin
M.
Truman
,
my
colleague
at
the
Peterson
Institute
for
International
Economics
.
)
These
reforms
need
to
be
agreed
,
in
legislative
form
,
by
the
US
Congress
before
they
can
take
effect
.
For
whatever
reason
,
President
Barack
Obama
's
administration
did
not
push
this
item
hard
in
2013
and
early
2014
–
and
the
agenda
of
encouraging
further
IMF
reform
has
therefore
languished
.
The
Obama
administration
proposed
to
tie
IMF
reform
to
the
presumably
imminent
approval
by
Congress
of
funding
for
Ukraine
.
This
is
sensible
legislative
tactics
but
not
appealing
as
an
economic
strategy
.
But
the
bigger
problem
is
that
Ukraine
does
not
really
need
a
massive
loan
from
the
IMF
.
What
Ukraine
needs
is
a
sharp
reduction
in
corruption
,
as
well
as
real
legitimacy
(
through
the
ballot
box
)
for
people
who
want
to
rein
in
the
influence
of
oligarchs
–
a
group
that
has
sapped
the
economy
through
plunder
and
incompetence
over
the
past
two
decades
.
IMF
reform
is
sensible
and
should
be
supported
.
The
Europeans
do
not
need
their
current
level
of
representation
,
and
the
positions
and
voices
of
middle
-
and
lower
-
income
countries
should
be
strengthened
.
The
Obama
administration
needs
to
make
this
case
more
directly
and
forcefully
to
Congress
.
The
inherent
dullness
of
the
IMF
makes
that
hard
.
MAR
31
,
2014
.
Marx
and
the
Mechanical
Turk
.
Second
,
he
could
not
fully
grasp
that
rising
real
material
living
standards
for
the
working
class
might
well
go
hand
in
hand
with
a
rising
rate
of
exploitation
–
that
is
,
a
smaller
income
share
for
labor
.
And
,
third
,
Marx
was
fixated
on
the
labor
-
theory
of
value
.
The
second
and
third
problems
remain
huge
analytical
mistakes
.
But
,
while
Marx
's
belief
that
capital
and
labor
were
substitutes
,
not
complements
,
was
a
mistake
in
his
own
age
,
and
for
more
than
a
century
to
follow
,
it
may
not
be
a
mistake
today
.
Think
of
it
this
way
.
Humans
have
five
core
competencies
as
far
as
the
world
of
work
is
concerned
:
·
Moving
things
with
large
muscles
.
·
Finely
manipulating
things
with
small
muscles
.
·
Using
hands
,
mouths
,
brains
,
eyes
,
and
ears
to
ensure
that
ongoing
processes
and
procedures
happen
the
way
that
they
are
supposed
to
.
·
Engaging
in
social
reciprocity
and
negotiation
to
keep
us
all
pulling
in
the
same
direction
.
·
Thinking
up
new
things
–
activities
that
produce
outcomes
that
are
necessary
,
convenient
,
or
luxurious
–
for
us
to
do
.
How
many
of
us
can
be
employed
in
personal
services
,
and
how
can
such
jobs
be
highly
paid
(
in
absolute
terms
)
?
The
optimistic
view
is
that
those
,
like
me
,
who
find
ourselves
fearing
the
relative
wage
distribution
of
the
future
as
a
source
of
mammoth
inequality
and
power
imbalance
simply
suffer
from
a
failure
of
imagination
.
Marx
did
not
see
how
the
replacement
of
textile
workers
by
automatic
looms
could
possibly
do
anything
other
than
lower
workers
'
wages
.
After
all
,
the
volume
of
production
could
not
possibly
expand
enough
to
reemploy
everyone
who
lost
their
job
as
a
handloom
weaver
as
a
machine
-
minder
or
a
carpet
-
seller
,
could
it
?
It
could
,
but
Marx
's
mistake
was
not
a
new
one
.
A
century
earlier
,
the
French
physiocrats
Quesnay
,
Turgot
,
and
Condorcet
did
not
see
how
the
share
of
the
French
labor
force
employed
in
agriculture
could
possibly
fall
below
50
%
without
producing
social
ruin
.
After
all
,
in
a
world
of
solid
farmers
,
useful
craftsmen
,
dissolute
aristocrats
,
and
flunkies
,
demand
for
manufactured
items
and
flunkies
was
limited
by
how
much
of
each
aristocrats
could
use
.
Thus
,
a
decline
in
the
number
of
farmers
could
produce
no
outcome
other
than
poverty
and
widespread
beggary
.
Neither
Marx
nor
the
physiocrats
could
imagine
the
great
many
well
-
paid
things
that
we
could
find
to
do
once
we
no
longer
needed
to
employ
60
%
of
the
labor
force
in
agriculture
and
another
20
%
in
hand
spinning
,
handloom
weaving
,
and
land
transport
via
horse
and
cart
.
And
today
,
the
optimistic
view
is
that
those
with
excess
wealth
will
continue
to
think
of
lots
of
things
for
everyone
else
to
do
to
make
their
lives
more
convenient
and
luxurious
,
and
that
the
ingenuity
of
the
rich
will
outstrip
the
supply
of
labor
by
the
poor
and
turn
the
poor
into
the
middle
class
.
But
,
given
the
rapid
development
of
technologies
of
governance
and
control
,
the
pessimistic
view
deserves
attention
.
In
this
scenario

The
Yalta
Temptation
.
There
is
nothing
phony
,
however
,
about
the
efforts
we
Ukrainians
are
now
making
to
defend
our
country
and
our
democracy
.
Our
young
men
and
women
are
volunteering
for
military
service
like
never
before
.
Our
government
has
negotiated
a
standby
loan
agreement
with
the
International
Monetary
Fund
that
will
give
us
some
of
the
tools
that
we
need
to
get
our
financial
and
economic
house
in
order
.
That
agreement
will
also
impose
real
economic
pain
,
but
Ukrainians
are
willing
to
pay
the
price
in
order
to
preserve
our
independence
.
After
a
time
of
neglect
,
a
time
when
we
–
like
the
rest
of
Europe
–
believed
that
the
continent
's
borders
would
never
again
be
changed
by
force
,
we
are
also
increasing
our
defense
spending
,
despite
our
economy
's
precarious
state
.
There
will
be
no
more
surrendering
of
sovereign
Ukrainian
territory
.
Most
important
,
despite
the
Russian
army
massed
against
us
,
we
are
embarking
on
an
election
campaign
.
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
's
recent
phone
call
to
US
President
Barack
Obama
to
seek
renewed
diplomatic
talks
,
followed
by
a
Russian
white
paper
on
how
to
resolve
a
crisis
of
the
Kremlin
's
making
,
is
in
fact
a
peace
offensive
that
is
offensive
to
peace
.
Putin
's
gambit
is
akin
to
the
infamous
Yalta
Conference
in
1945
,
where
Joseph
Stalin
made
Winston
Churchill
and
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
complicit
in
a
division
of
Europe
that
enslaved
half
of
the
continent
for
almost
a
half
-
century
.
Today
,
Putin
is
seeking
to
make
the
West
complicit
in
the
dismemberment
of
Ukraine
by
negotiating
a
Kremlin
-
designed
federal
constitution
that
would
create
a
dozen
Crimeas
–
bite
-
size
chunks
that
Russia
could
devour
more
easily
later
.
Of
course
,
federalism
sounds
like
a
good
thing
.
Devolving
political
power
closer
to
where
people
actually
live
is
always
,
appealing
and
usually
effective
.
But
the
wellbeing
of
Ukrainian
democracy
is
not
what
Putin
has
in
mind
;
for
him
,
a
federal
system
is
a
means
for
the
Kremlin
to
make
political
mischief
and
ultimately
incorporate
Ukraine
's
eastern
and
southern
regions
into
the
Russian
Federation
.
To
paraphrase
Clausewitz
,
federalism
for
Putin
is
annexation
by
other
means
.
One
has
only
to
look
at
the
Russian
proposal
's
fine
print
:
Ukraine
's
new
federal
units
would
have
a
powerful
say
over
"
Ukraine
's
foreign
-
policy
direction
.
Ukraine
's
constitutional
structure
is
for
Ukraine
's
citizens
alone
to
decide
.
Russia
can
have
no
say
in
it
–
and
nor
should
other
countries
,
however
helpful
they
wish
to
be
.
Ukraine
is
not
Bosnia
,
where
the
constitution
emerged
out
of
peace
talks
that
ended
years
of
bloody
warfare
following
the
breakup
of
Yugoslavia
.
Nor
is
it
Kosovo
,
which
became
independent
at
the
same
time
that
its
governmental
structures
were
being
forged
.
Ukraine
is
a
fully
sovereign
state
,
recognized
as
such
by
the
world
,
including
Russia
.
To
buy
into
Putin
's
sham
federalism
is
to
accept
the
lies
that
the
Kremlin
has
been
spewing
about
Ukraine
's
current
interim
government
and
the
brave
men
and
women
who
ousted
Yanukovych
.
Putin
's
factotums
claim
that
Ukraine
's
Russian
speakers
are
under
threat
,
but
they
cannot
point
to
a
single
example
of
persecution
that
might
bear
this
out
.
No
Russian
-
speaking
refugees
from
eastern
Ukraine
or
Crimea
have
fled
into
Russia
,
and
no
Russian
-
speaker
has
sought
political
asylum
anywhere
else
outside
the
country
.
The
reason
is
simple
:
there
is
no
oppression
of
Russian
speakers
in
Ukraine
,
and
there
never
has
been
.
Ukraine
's
government
under
Yanukovych
was
incompetent
,
corrupt
,
and
mendacious
.
But
it
was
an
equal
-
opportunity
oppressor
.
So
should
Ukraine
really
be
forced
to
create
a
new
constitutional
order
based
on
the
Big
Lie
?
What
we
need
is
a
competent
,
efficient
,
and
corruption
-
free
government
.
And
with
Europe
's
help
and
technical
assistance
,
we
will
establish
one
.
The
desire
of
diplomats
to
find
a
peaceful
solution
to
Ukraine
's
crisis
is
understandable
.
But
the
terms
that
Russia
is
demanding
,
if
accepted
by
the
West
,
would
fatally
undermine
Ukraine
's
sovereignty
;
worse
,
accepting
Russia
's
terms
would
ratify
the
idea
that
powerful
countries
may
bully
less
powerful
neighbors
into
doing
their
bidding
,
to
the
point
of
surrendering
their
independence
.
Ukraine
will
stand
up
to
the
bully
–
on
our
own
,
if
necessary
.
We
refuse
to
play
the
part
of
hapless
victim

The
Mosquito
Menace
.
STANFORD
–
Mosquito
-
borne
diseases
kill
millions
of
people
annually
,
and
cause
suffering
for
many
more
.
In
2012
,
there
were
an
estimated
207
million
cases
of
malaria
,
leading
to
some
627,000
deaths
.
Dengue
fever
is
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
tropics
and
subtropics
,
with
as
many
as
100
million
people
infected
each
year
.
It
takes
only
one
bite
from
a
disease
-
carrying
mosquito
to
transmit
a
debilitating
or
deadly
infection
–
and
mosquitoes
breed
and
multiply
with
astonishing
speed
.
Given
that
there
are
no
vaccines
or
drug
treatments
for
illnesses
like
dengue
fever
and
West
Nile
virus
,
and
that
treatments
for
diseases
like
malaria
are
difficult
to
access
in
many
at
-
risk
areas
,
more
effective
mechanisms
for
controlling
mosquito
populations
are
desperately
needed
.
The
good
news
is
that
a
promising
new
technology
is
ready
for
field-testing
.
It
is
now
up
to
government
agencies
to
facilitate
its
development
.
Today
,
the
dominant
method
for
reducing
insect
populations
–
the
so-called
"
sterile
insect
technique
"
(
SIT
)
–
relies
on
radiation
to
sterilize
males
,
which
are
then
released
into
infested
areas
to
mate
.
But
this
approach
,
which
has
been
used
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
,
has
not
been
effective
with
mosquitoes
,
owing
to
their
fragility
.
Advances
in
molecular
biology
offer
analogous
–
but
far
more
sophisticated
–
solutions
.
Using
molecular
genetic
-
engineering
techniques
,
the
British
company
Oxitec
has
created
a
new
way
to
control
the
mosquito
species
that
transmits
dengue
fever
.
Male
mosquitoes
do
not
bite
,
so
their
release
presents
no
health
risk
,
and
,
because
their
progeny
die
,
no
genetically
engineered
mosquitoes
persist
in
the
environment
.
If
the
males
are
released
over
a
period
of
several
months
,
this
would
,
in
theory
,
result
in
a
marked
reduction
in
the
mosquito
population
.
All
that
is
needed
now
is
to
determine
whether
it
works
in
practice
.
Scientific
research
to
develop
products
like
irradiated
sterile
insects
or
the
Oxitec
mosquitoes
proceeds
progressively
from
more
to
less
contained
conditions
–
from
the
laboratory
to
confined
trials
to
limited
field
trials
.
Now
that
Oxitec
has
conducted
promising
field
trials
in
the
Cayman
Islands
,
Malaysia
,
and
Brazil
,
it
is
preparing
to
conduct
trials
in
other
countries
,
including
the
United
States
.
In
order
to
determine
the
appropriate
level
of
oversight
,
government
bodies
would
presumably
conduct
a
science
-
based
risk
analysis
.
The
fact
is
that
molecular
genetic
engineering
is
more
precise
and
predictable
than
older
,
cruder
techniques
As
a
result
,
research
and
development
in
genetic
engineering
is
more
expensive
,
discouraging
investment
and
hampering
innovation
.
This
is
all
the
more
problematic
in
the
case
of
mosquito
control
,
given
the
urgency
of
the
problem
.
The
World
Health
Organization
's
Special
Program
for
Research
and
Training
in
Tropical
Diseases
has
called
upon
regulatory
agencies
to
emphasize
"
science
-
based
,
case-by-case
targeted
requirements
with
a
degree
of
practical
parsimony
,
"
instead
of
relying
on
"
a
precautionary
approach
that
can
require
data
to
address
all
theoretical
risks
.
Given
the
degree
of
suffering
caused
by
mosquito
-
borne
diseases
,
government
leaders
must
not
subject
genetic
-
engineering
solutions
for
controlling
them
to
the
same
kinds
of
political
and
populist
headwinds
that
have
impeded
the
approval
of
genetically
engineered
agricultural
products
.
Europe
's
Deepening
Muddle
.
PRINCETON
–
German
Finance
Minister
Wolfgang
Schäuble
recently
declared
that
the
European
Union
has
"
moved
sovereignty
to
the
European
level
"
–
a
startling
claim
,
given
that
European
governments
seem
to
be
pursuing
their
national
interests
more
aggressively
than
at
any
time
since
World
War
II
.
Was
Schauble
's
statement
supposed
to
serve
as
a
rallying
cry
for
greater
European
solidarity
?
While
Schauble
's
strategy
may
sound
appealing
,
it
is
,
at
best
,
the
symbolic
garb
of
progress
.
For
starters
,
the
common
funds
are
meager
,
with
no
prospect
of
being
increased
–
not
least
because
of
Germany
's
unrelenting
opposition
.
Likewise
,
so
long
as
member
countries
maintain
fiscal
sovereignty
,
a
new
mechanism
to
facilitate
finger
-
wagging
at
countries
that
defy
European
budget
rules
will
change
nothing
.
Over
the
last
two
decades
,
every
effort
to
discipline
the
EU
's
fiscal
delinquents
has
failed
,
owing
to
the
lack
of
enforcement
authority
.
Even
as
Germany
's
Bundesbank
fiercely
(
and
rightly
)
opposed
the
OMT
program
for
its
focus
on
countries
'
solvency
,
rather
than
liquidity
risk
–
thus
creating
a
backdoor
fiscal
union
–
the
government
was
relieved
that
the
German
Constitutional
Court
,
assessing
the
scheme
's
legality
,
ultimately
passed
the
buck
to
the
European
Court
of
Justice
.
The
EU
is
an
inspiring
political
structure
that
seeks
to
break
the
mold
of
the
nineteenth
-
century
nation
-
state
.
But
progress
toward
that
idealistic
vision
cannot
continue
to
depend
on
shopworn
symbolism
.
The
euro
was
the
most
audacious
of
those
symbols
–
a
construct
of
dubious
economic
value
,
with
well
-
documented
fragilities
.
Its
adoption
was
an
act
of
economic
hubris
that
has
imposed
costs
well
beyond
Europe
's
borders
.
Today
,
European
leaders
are
indulging
in
triumphalism
,
viewing
the
current
economic
reprieve
as
a
validation
of
failed
transnational
governance
structures
.
But
the
depth
and
persistence
of
the
ongoing
crisis
have
exposed
the
euro
's
fundamental
fragilities
,
and
should
serve
as
a
warning
that
today
's
technocratic
Band
-
Aids
may
not
hold
in
the
face
of
another
shock
.
Unfortunately
,
bold
action
to
address
these
fragilities
seems
more
distant
than
ever
.
Balzac
(
20
May
1799
-
18
August
1850
)
was
a
French
novelist
and
playwright
.
His
magnum
opus
was
a
sequence
of
short
stories
and
novels
collectively
entitled
La
Comédie
humaine
,
which
presents
a
panorama
of
French
life
in
the
years
after
the
1815
fall
of
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
Due
to
his
keen
observation
of
detail
and
unfiltered
representation
of
society
,
Balzac
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
founders
of
realism
in
European
literature
.
His
writing
influenced
many
subsequent
novelists
such
as
Marcel
Proust
,
Émile
Zola
,
Charles
Dickens
,
Edgar
Allan
Poe
,
Eça
De
Queirós
,
Fyodor
Dostoyevsky
,
Gustave
Flaubert
,
Benito
Pérez
Galdós
,
Marie
Corelli
,
Henry
James
,
William
Faulkner
,
Jack
Kerouac
,
and
Italo
Calvino
,
and
philosophers
such
as
Friedrich
Engels
and
Karl
Marx
.
Many
of
Balzac
's
works
have
been
made
into
or
have
inspired
films
,
and
they
are
a
continuing
source
of
inspiration
for
writers
,
filmmakers
and
critics
.
An
enthusiastic
reader
and
independent
thinker
as
a
child
,
Balzac
had
trouble
adapting
to
the
teaching
style
of
his
grammar
school
.
His
willful
nature
caused
trouble
throughout
his
life
and
frustrated
his
ambitions
to
succeed
in
the
world
of
business
.
When
he
finished
school
,
Balzac
was
an
apprentice
in
a
law
office
,
but
he
turned
his
back
on
the
study
of
law
after
wearying
of
its
inhumanity
and
banal
routine
.
Before
and
during
his
career
as
a
writer
,
he
attempted
to
be
a
publisher
,
printer
,
businessman
,
critic
,
and
politician
;
he
failed
in
all
of
these
efforts
.
La
Comédie
humaine
reflects
his
real
-
life
difficulties
,
and
includes
scenes
from
his
own
experience
.
Balzac
suffered
from
health
problems
throughout
his
life
,
possibly
due
to
his
intense
writing
schedule
.
His
relationship
with
his
family
was
often
strained
by
financial
and
personal
difficulties
,
and
he
ended
several
friendships
over
critical
reviews
.
In
1850
he
married
Ewelina
Hanska
,
his
longtime
love
;
he
died
five
months
later
.
Honoré
De
Balzac
was
born
into
a
family
which
had
struggled
nobly
to
achieve
respectability
.
His
father
,
born
Bernard
-
François
,
was
one
of
eleven
children
from
a
poor
family
in
Tarn
,
a
region
in
the
south
of
France
.
In
1760
the
elder
Balzac
set
off
for
Paris
with
only
a
louis
coin
in
his
pocket
,
determined
to
improve
his
social
standing
;
by
1776
he
had
become
Secretary
to
the
King
's
Council
and
a
Freemason
.
He
had
also
changed
his
name
to
that
of
an
ancient
noble
family
,
and
added
-
without
any
official
cause
-
the
nobiliary
particle
De
.
After
the
Reign
of
Terror
(
1793
–
94
)
,
he
was
sent
to
Tours
to
coordinate
supplies
for
the
Army
.
Balzac
's
mother
,
born
Anne
-
Charlotte
-
Laure
Sallambier
,
came
from
a
family
of
haberdashers
in
Paris
.
Her
family
's
wealth
was
a
considerable
factor
in
the
match
:
she
was
eighteen
at
the
time
of
the
wedding
,
and
Bernard
-
François
fifty
.
She
was
not
in
love
with
her
husband
.
exactly
one
year
previous
,
Louis
-
Daniel
had
been
born
,
but
he
lived
for
only
a
month
.
Honoré
's
sisters
Laure
and
Laurence
were
born
in
1800
and
1802
,
and
his
brother
Henry
-
François
in
1807
.
As
an
infant
Balzac
was
sent
to
a
wet-nurse
;
the
following
year
he
was
joined
by
his
sister
Laure
and
they
spent
four
years
away
from
home
.
(
Although
Genevan
philosopher
Jean
-
Jacques
Rousseau
's
influential
book
Émile
convinced
many
mothers
of
the
time
to
nurse
their
own
children
,
sending
babies
to
wet-nurses
was
still
common
among
the
middle
and
upper
classes
.
)
When
the
Balzac
children
returned
home
,
they
were
kept
at
a
frigid
distance
by
their
parents
,
which
affected
the
author
-
to
-
be
significantly
.
His
1835
novel
Le
Lys
dans
La
Vallée
features
a
cruel
governess
named
Miss
Caroline
,
modeled
after
his
own
caregiver
.
At
age
ten
Balzac
was
sent
to
the
Oratorian
grammar
school
in
Vendôme
,
where
he
studied
for
seven
years
.
His
father
,
seeking
to
instill
the
same
hardscrabble
work
ethic
which
had
gained
him
the
esteem
of
society
,
intentionally
gave
little
spending
money
to
the
boy
.
This
made
him
the
object
of
ridicule
among
his
much
wealthier
schoolmates
.
As
a
result
,
he
was
frequently
sent
to
the
"
alcove
,
"
a
punishment
cell
reserved
for
disobedient
students
.
Balzac
worked
these
scenes
from
his
boyhood
-
as
he
did
many
aspects
of
his
life
and
the
lives
of
those
around
him
-
into
La
Comédie
Humaine
.
He
had
told
me
that
he
found
indescribable
delight
in
reading
dictionaries
for
lack
of
other
books
.
Balzac
often
fell
ill
,
finally
causing
the
headmaster
to
contact
his
family
with
news
of
a
sort
of
a
coma
"
.
When
he
returned
home
,
his
grandmother
said
:
Balzac
himself
attributed
his
condition
to
intellectual
congestion
"
,
but
his
extended
confinement
in
the
"
alcove
"
was
surely
a
factor
.
(
Meanwhile
,
his
father
had
been
writing
a
treatise
on
"
the
means
of
preventing
thefts
and
murders
,
and
of
restoring
the
men
who
commit
them
to
a
useful
role
in
society
"
,
in
which
he
heaped
disdain
on
prison
as
a
form
of
crime
prevention
.
)
In
1814
the
Balzac
family
moved
to
Paris
,
and
Honoré
was
sent
to
private
tutors
and
schools
for
the
next
two
and
a
half
years
.
This
was
an
unhappy
time
in
his
life
,
during
which
he
attempted
suicide
on
a
bridge
over
the
Loire
River
.
In
1816
Balzac
entered
the
Sorbonne
,
where
he
studied
under
three
famous
professors
.
François
Guizot
,
who
later
became
Prime
Minister
,
was
Professor
of
Modern
History
.
Abel
-
François
Villemain
,
a
recent
arrival
from
the
Collège
Charlemagne
,
lectured
on
French
and
classical
literature
.
And
-
most
influential
of
all
-
Victor
Cousin
's
courses
on
philosophy
encouraged
his
students
to
think
independently
.
Once
his
studies
were
completed
,
Balzac
was
persuaded
by
his
father
to
follow
him
into
the
law
;
for
three
years
he
trained
and
worked
at
the
office
of
Victor
Passez
,
a
family
friend
.
During
this
time
Balzac
began
to
understand
the
vagaries
of
human
nature
.
In
his
1840
novel
Le
Notaire
,
he
wrote
that
a
young
person
in
the
legal
profession
sees
"
the
oily
wheels
of
every
fortune
,
the
hideous
wrangling
of
heirs
over
corpses
not
yet
cold
,
the
human
heart
grappling
with
the
Penal
Code
.
"
In
1819
Passez
offered
to
make
Balzac
his
successor
,
but
his
apprentice
had
enough
of
the
law
.
He
despaired
of
being
"
a
clerk
,
a
machine
,
a
riding
-
school
hack
,
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
at
fixed
hours
.
I
should
be
like
everyone
else
.
And
that
's
what
they
call
living
,
that
life
at
the
grindstone
,
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
....
I
am
hungry
and
nothing
is
offered
to
appease
my
appetite
.
The
loss
of
this
opportunity
caused
serious
discord
in
the
Balzac
household
,
although
Honoré
was
not
turned
away
entirely
.
Instead
,
in
April
1819
he
was
allowed
to
live
in
the
French
capital
-
as
English
critic
George
Saintsbury
describes
it
-
"
in
a
garret
furnished
in
the
most
Spartan
fashion
,
with
a
starvation
allowance
and
an
old
woman
to
look
after
him
"
,
while
the
rest
of
the
family
moved
to
a
house
twenty
miles
[
32
km
]
outside
Paris
.
Balzac
's
first
project
was
a
libretto
for
a
comic
opera
called
Le
Corsaire
,
based
on
Lord
Byron
's
The
Corsair
.
Realizing
he
would
have
trouble
finding
a
composer
,
however
,
he
turned
to
other
pursuits
.
In
1820
Balzac
completed
the
five
-
act
verse
tragedy
Cromwell
.
Although
it
pales
in
comparison
to
later
works
,
some
critics
consider
it
a
quality
text
.
When
he
finished
,
Balzac
went
to
Villeparisis
and
read
the
entire
work
to
his
family
;
they
were
unimpressed
.
He
followed
this
effort
by
starting
(
but
never
finishing
)
three
novels
:
Sténie
,
Falthurne
,
and
Corsino
.
In
1821
Balzac
met
the
enterprising
Auguste
Lepoitevin
,
who
convinced
the
author
to
write
short
stories
,
which
Lepoitevin
would
then
sell
to
publishers
.
Balzac
quickly
turned
to
longer
works
,
and
by
1826
he
had
written
nine
novels
,
all
published
under
pseudonyms
and
often
produced
in
collaboration
with
other
writers
.
For
example
,
the
scandalous
novel
Vicaire
des
Ardennes
(
1822
)
-
banned
for
its
depiction
of
nearly
-
incestuous
relations
and
,
more
egregiously
,
of
a
married
priest
-
attributed
to
a
'
Horace
De
Saint
-
Aubin
'
.
These
books
were
potboiler
novels
,
designed
to
sell
quickly
and
titillate
audiences
.
In
Saintsbury
's
view
,
"
They
are
curiously
,
interestingly
,
almost
enthrallingly
bad
.
Biographer
Graham
Robb
suggests
that
as
he
discovered
the
Novel
,
Balzac
discovered
himself
.
During
this
time
Balzac
wrote
two
pamphlets
in
support
of
primogeniture
and
the
Society
of
Jesus
.
The
latter
,
regarding
the
Jesuit
order
,
illustrated
his
lifelong
admiration
for
the
Catholic
Church
.
In
the
preface
to
La
Comédie
Humaine
he
wrote
:
Christianity
,
and
especially
Catholicism
,
being
a
complete
repression
of
man
's
depraved
tendencies
,
is
the
greatest
element
in
Social
Order
.
His
first
venture
was
a
publishing
enterprise
which
turned
out
cheap
one
-
volume
editions
of
French
classics
including
the
works
of
Molière
.
This
business
failed
miserably
,
with
many
of
the
books
"
sold
as
waste
paper
"
.
Balzac
had
better
luck
publishing
the
memoirs
of
Laure
Junot
,
Duchess
of
Abrantès
-
with
whom
he
also
had
an
affair
.
Balzac
borrowed
money
from
his
family
and
friends
,
and
tried
to
build
a
printing
business
,
then
a
typefounder
enterprise
.
His
inexperience
and
lack
of
capital
caused
his
ruin
in
these
trades
.
He
gave
the
businesses
to
a
friend
(
who
made
them
successful
)
but
carried
the
debts
for
many
years
.
As
of
April
1828
Balzac
owed
50,000
francs
to
his
mother
.
Balzac
never
lost
his
penchant
for
une
bonne
spéculation
.
It
resurfaced
painfully
later
when
-
as
a
renowned
and
busy
author
-
he
traveled
to
Sardinia
in
the
hopes
of
reprocessing
the
slag
from
the
Roman
mines
in
that
country
.
After
writing
several
novels
,
in
1832
Balzac
conceived
the
idea
for
an
enormous
series
of
books
that
would
paint
a
panoramic
portrait
of
"
all
aspects
of
society
.
This
was
to
be
Balzac
's
life
work
and
his
greatest
achievement
.
After
the
collapse
of
his
businesses
,
Balzac
traveled
to
Brittany
and
stayed
with
the
De
Pommereul
family
outside
Fougères
.
There
he
drew
inspiration
for
Les
Chouans
(
1829
)
,
a
tale
of
love
gone
wrong
amid
the
Chouan
royalist
forces
.
This
was
the
first
book
Balzac
released
under
his
own
name
,
and
it
gave
him
what
one
critic
called
"
passage
into
the
Promised
Land
"
.
It
established
him
as
an
author
of
note
(
even
if
the
surface
owes
a
debt
to
Walter
Scott
)
and
provided
him
with
a
name
outside
his
past
pseudonyms
.
Soon
afterwards
,
around
the
time
of
his
father
's
death
,
Balzac
wrote
El
Verdugo
-
about
a
30
-
year
-
old
man
who
kills
his
father
(
Balzac
was
30
years
old
at
the
time
)
.
This
was
the
first
work
signed
"
Honoré
De
Balzac
"
.
Like
his
father
,
he
added
the
aristocratic
-
sounding
particle
to
help
him
fit
into
respected
society
,
but
it
was
a
choice
based
on
skill
,
not
birthright
.
The
aristocracy
and
authority
of
talent
are
more
substantial
than
the
aristocracy
of
names
and
material
power
,
he
wrote
in
1830
.
The
timing
of
the
decision
was
also
significant
;
When
the
July
Revolution
overthrew
Charles
X
in
1830
,
Balzac
declared
himself
a
Legitimist
,
supporting
Charles
'
House
of
Bourbon
-
but
with
qualifications
.
He
felt
that
the
new
July
Monarchy
(
which
claimed
widespread
popular
support
)
was
disorganized
and
unprincipled
,
in
need
of
a
mediator
to
keep
the
political
peace
between
the
King
and
insurgent
forces
.
But
after
a
near
-
fatal
accident
in
1832
(
he
slipped
and
his
head
on
the
street
)
,
Balzac
decided
not
to
stand
for
election
.
1831
saw
the
success
of
La
Peau
De
Chagrin
(
The
Wild
Ass
's
Skin
or
The
Magic
skin
)
,
a
fable
-
like
tale
about
a
despondent
young
man
named
Raphaël
De
Valentin
who
finds
an
animal
skin
which
promises
great
power
and
wealth
.
He
obtains
these
things
,
but
loses
the
ability
to
manage
them
.
Balzac
meant
the
story
to
bear
witness
to
the
treacherous
turns
of
life
,
its
"
serpentine
motion
.
The
tale
of
a
young
lady
who
inherits
her
father
's
miserliness
,
it
also
became
the
most
critically
acclaimed
book
of
his
career
.
The
writing
is
simple
,
yet
the
individuals
(
especially
the
bourgeois
title
character
)
are
dynamic
and
complex
.
Today
the
Maison
De
Balzac
is
one
of
Paris
's
three
literary
museums
.
Le
Père
Goriot
(
Old
Father
Goriot
,
1835
)
was
his
next
success
,
in
which
Balzac
transposes
the
story
of
King
Lear
to
1820
's
Paris
in
order
to
rage
at
a
society
bereft
of
all
love
save
the
love
of
money
.
The
centrality
of
a
father
in
this
novel
matches
Balzac
's
own
position
-
not
only
as
mentor
to
his
troubled
young
secretary
,
Jules
Sandeau
,
but
also
the
fact
that
he
had
(
most
likely
)
fathered
a
child
,
Marie
-
Caroline
,
with
his
otherwise
-
married
lover
,
Maria
Du
Fresnay
.
In
1836
Balzac
took
the
helm
of
the
Chronique
De
Paris
,
a
weekly
magazine
of
society
and
politics
.
He
tried
to
enforce
strict
impartiality
in
its
pages
and
a
reasoned
assessment
of
various
ideologies
.
As
Rogers
notes
,
"
Balzac
was
interested
in
any
social
,
political
,
or
economic
theory
,
whether
from
the
right
or
the
left
.
It
lasted
for
three
issues
.
These
dismal
business
efforts
-
and
his
misadventures
in
Sardinia
-
provided
an
appropriate
milieu
in
which
to
set
the
two
-
volume
Illusions
Perdues
(
Lost
Illusions
,
1843
)
.
The
novel
concerns
Lucien
De
Rubempré
,
a
young
poet
trying
to
make
a
name
for
himself
,
who
becomes
trapped
in
the
morass
of
society
's
darkest
contradictions
.
Lucien
's
journalism
work
is
informed
by
Balzac
's
own
failed
ventures
in
the
field
.
Splendeurs
et
misères
des
courtisanes
(
The
Harlot
High
and
Low
,
1847
)
continues
Lucien
's
story
.
He
is
trapped
by
the
Abbé
Herrera
(
Vautrin
)
in
a
convoluted
and
disastrous
plan
to
regain
social
status
.
The
book
undergoes
a
massive
temporal
rift
;
the
first
part
(
of
four
)
covers
a
span
of
six
years
,
while
the
final
two
sections
focus
on
just
three
days
.
The
conniving
and
wrangling
over
wills
and
inheritances
reflect
the
expertise
gained
by
the
author
as
a
young
law
clerk
.
Balzac
's
health
was
deteriorating
by
this
point
,
making
the
completion
of
this
pair
of
books
a
significant
accomplishment
.
Many
of
his
novels
were
initially
serialized
,
like
those
of
Dickens
.
Illusions
Perdues
extends
to
a
thousand
pages
after
starting
inauspiciously
in
a
small
-
town
print
shop
,
whereas
La
Fille
aux
Yeux
D'
Or
(
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
,
1835
)
opens
with
a
broad
panorama
of
Paris
but
becomes
a
closely
plotted
novella
of
only
fifty
pages
.
He
then
rose
and
wrote
for
many
hours
,
fueled
by
innumerable
cups
of
black
coffee
.
He
would
often
work
for
fifteen
hours
or
more
at
a
stretch
;
he
claimed
to
have
once
worked
for
48
hours
with
only
three
hours
of
rest
in
the
middle
.
Balzac
revised
obsessively
,
covering
printer
's
proofs
with
changes
and
additions
to
be
reset
.
He
sometimes
repeated
this
process
during
the
publication
of
a
book
,
causing
significant
expense
for
both
himself
and
the
publisher
.
As
a
result
,
the
finished
product
was
frequently
quite
different
from
the
original
book
.
While
some
of
his
books
never
reached
a
finished
state
,
some
of
those
-
such
as
Les
employés
(
The
Government
Clerks
,
1841
)
-
are
nonetheless
noted
by
critics
.
He
was
friends
with
Théophile
Gautier
and
Pierre
-
Marie
-
Charles
De
Bernard
du
Grail
De
La
Villette
,
and
he
knew
Victor
Hugo
.
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
spend
as
much
time
in
salons
and
clubs
as
did
many
of
his
characters
.
In
the
first
place
he
was
too
busy
,
explains
Saintsbury
,
"
in
the
second
he
would
not
have
been
at
home
there
....
He
felt
it
was
his
business
not
to
frequent
society
but
to
create
it
.
Many
of
Balzac
's
tormented
characters
were
created
in
the
small
second
-
floor
bedroom
.
Today
the
Château
is
a
museum
dedicated
to
the
author
's
life
.
In
February
1832
Balzac
received
a
letter
from
Odessa
-
lacking
a
return
address
and
signed
only
by
"
L
'
Étrangère
"
(
"
The
Foreigner
"
)
-
expressing
sadness
at
the
cynicism
and
atheism
in
La
Peau
De
Chagrin
and
its
negative
portrayal
of
women
.
He
responded
by
purchasing
a
classified
advertisement
in
the
Gazette
De
France
,
hoping
that
his
anonymous
critic
would
find
it
.
Thus
began
a
fifteen
-
year
correspondence
between
Balzac
and
"
the
object
of
[
his
]
sweetest
dreams
"
:
Ewelina
Hanska
.
Hanska
was
married
to
a
man
twenty
years
her
senior
,
Waclaw
Hanski
,
a
wealthy
Polish
landowner
living
near
Kiev
.
It
had
been
a
marriage
of
convenience
to
preserve
her
family
's
fortune
.
In
Balzac
Ewelina
found
a
kindred
spirit
for
her
emotional
and
social
desires
,
with
the
added
benefit
of
feeling
a
connection
to
the
glamorous
capital
of
France
.
Robb
says
it
is
"
like
an
experimental
novel
in
which
the
female
protagonist
is
always
trying
to
pull
in
extraneous
realities
but
which
the
hero
is
determined
to
keep
on
course
,
whatever
tricks
he
has
to
use
.
Competing
with
the
Hungarian
composer
Franz
Liszt
,
Balzac
visited
her
in
St.
Petersburg
in
1843
and
impressed
himself
on
her
heart
.
After
a
series
of
economic
setbacks
,
health
problems
,
and
prohibitions
from
the
Tsar
,
the
couple
were
finally
able
to
wed
.
On
14
March
1850
,
with
Balzac
's
health
in
serious
decline
,
they
drove
from
her
estate
in
Wierzchownia
(
village
of
Verkhivnia
)
to
a
church
in
Berdyczów
(
city
of
Berdychiv
,
today
in
Ukraine
)
and
were
married
.
The
ten
-
hour
journey
to
and
from
the
ceremony
took
a
toll
on
both
husband
and
wife
:
her
feet
were
too
swollen
to
walk
,
and
he
endured
severe
heart
trouble
.
Although
he
married
late
in
life
,
Balzac
had
already
written
two
treatises
on
marriage
:
Physiologie
du
Mariage
and
Scènes
De
La
Vie
Conjugale
.
These
works
suffered
from
a
lack
of
firsthand
knowledge
;
Saintsbury
points
out
that
"
Cœlebs
cannot
talk
of
[
marriage
]
with
much
authority
.
They
arrived
in
the
French
capital
on
20
May
,
his
fifty
-
first
birthday
.
Five
months
after
his
wedding
,
on
18
August
,
Balzac
died
.
He
had
been
visited
that
day
by
Victor
Hugo
,
who
later
served
as
pallbearer
and
eulogist
at
Balzac
's
funeral
.
Balzac
was
buried
at
the
Cimetière
du
Père
Lachaise
in
Paris
.
Today
,
said
Hugo
at
the
ceremony
,
"
we
have
a
people
in
black
because
of
the
death
of
the
man
of
talent
;
a
nation
in
mourning
for
a
man
of
genius
.
The
funeral
was
attended
by
almost
every
writer
in
Paris
"
,
including
Frédérick
Lemaître
,
Gustave
Courbet
,
Dumas
père
and
Dumas
fils
.
Later
,
Balzac
became
the
subject
of
a
monumental
statue
by
the
French
sculptor
Auguste
Rodin
,
which
stands
near
the
intersection
of
Boulevard
Raspail
and
Boulevard
Montparnasse
.
Rodin
featured
Balzac
in
several
of
his
smaller
sculptures
as
well
.
The
Comédie
Humaine
remained
unfinished
at
the
time
of
his
death
-
Balzac
had
plans
to
include
numerous
other
books
,
most
of
which
he
never
started
.
He
frequently
moved
between
works
in
progress
,
and
"
finished
"
works
were
often
revised
between
editions
.
This
piecemeal
style
is
reflective
of
the
author
's
own
life
,
a
possible
attempt
to
stabilize
it
through
fiction
.
The
vanishing
man
,
writes
Pritchett
,
"
who
must
be
pursued
from
the
rue
Cassini
to
...
Versailles
,
Ville
D'
Avray
,
Italy
,
and
Vienna
can
construct
a
settled
dwelling
only
in
his
work
.
In
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
Scènes
De
La
Vie
Privée
,
he
writes
:
For
example
,
Balzac
's
friend
Hyacinthe
De
Latouche
had
knowledge
of
hanging
wallpaper
.
Balzac
transferred
this
to
his
descriptions
of
the
Pension
Vauquer
in
Le
Père
Goriot
,
making
the
wallpaper
speak
of
the
identities
of
those
living
inside
.
French
novelist
Émile
Zola
declared
Balzac
the
father
of
the
naturalist
novel
.
Zola
indicated
that
,
whereas
Romantics
saw
the
world
through
a
colored
lens
,
the
naturalist
sees
through
a
clear
glass
-
precisely
the
sort
of
effect
Balzac
attempted
to
achieve
in
his
works
.
To
arrive
at
the
truth
,
he
wrote
in
the
preface
to
Le
Lys
dans
La
Vallée
,
"
writers
use
whatever
literary
device
seems
capable
of
giving
the
greatest
intensity
of
life
to
their
characters
.
Balzac
's
characters
"
,
Robb
notes
,
"
were
as
real
to
him
as
if
he
were
observing
them
in
the
outside
world
.
I
remember
it
when
I
laugh
.
One
critic
explained
that
"
there
is
a
center
and
a
circumference
to
Balzac
's
world
.
When
the
characters
reappear
,
notes
Rogers
,
"
they
do
not
step
out
of
nowhere
;
they
emerge
from
the
privacy
of
their
own
lives
which
,
for
an
interval
,
we
have
not
been
allowed
to
see
.
He
also
used
a
realist
technique
which
French
novelist
Marcel
Proust
later
named
retrospective
illumination
"
,
whereby
a
character
's
past
is
revealed
long
after
she
or
he
first
appears
.
A
nearly
infinite
reserve
of
energy
propels
the
characters
in
Balzac
's
novels
.
Struggling
against
the
currents
of
human
nature
and
society
,
they
may
lose
more
often
than
they
win
-
but
only
rarely
do
they
give
up
.
Balzac
spoke
often
of
a
"
nervous
and
fluid
force
"
between
individuals
,
and
Raphaël
Valentin
's
decline
in
La
Peau
De
Chagrin
exemplifies
the
danger
of
withdrawing
from
the
company
of
other
people
.
Intricate
details
about
locations
sometimes
stretch
for
fifteen
or
twenty
pages
.
The
influence
of
Paris
permeates
La
Comédie
.
The
centrality
of
Paris
in
La
Comédie
Humaine
is
key
to
Balzac
's
legacy
as
a
realist
.
Realism
is
nothing
if
not
urban
,
notes
critic
Peter
Brooks
;
the
scene
of
a
young
man
coming
into
the
city
to
find
his
fortune
is
ubiquitous
in
the
realist
novel
,
and
appears
repeatedly
in
Balzac
's
works
,
such
as
Illusions
Perdues
.
Balzac
's
literary
mood
evolved
over
time
from
one
of
despondency
and
chagrin
to
one
of
solidarity
and
courage
-
but
not
optimism
.
La
Peau
De
Chagrin
,
among
his
earliest
novels
,
is
a
pessimistic
tale
of
confusion
and
destruction
.
But
the
cynicism
declined
as
his
oeuvre
progressed
,
and
the
characters
of
Illusions
Perdues
reveal
sympathy
for
those
who
are
pushed
to
one
side
by
society
.
Balzac
concerned
himself
overwhelmingly
with
the
darker
essence
of
human
nature
and
the
corrupting
influence
of
middle
and
high
societies
.
He
worked
to
observe
humanity
in
its
most
representative
state
,
frequently
passing
incognito
among
the
masses
of
Parisian
society
to
do
research
.
He
used
incidents
from
his
life
and
the
people
around
him
,
in
works
like
Eugénie
Grandet
and
Louis
Lambert
.
Balzac
was
a
highly
conservative
Royalist
;
in
many
ways
,
he
is
the
antipode
to
Victor
Hugo
's
democratic
republicanism
.
Nevertheless
,
his
keen
insight
regarding
working-class
conditions
earned
him
the
esteem
of
many
Socialists
and
Marxists
.
Engels
said
that
Balzac
was
his
favorite
writer
.
Marx
's
work
Das
Kapital
also
makes
constant
reference
to
the
works
of
Balzac
and
urged
Engels
to
read
Balzac
's
work
The
Unknown
Masterpiece
.
Balzac
influenced
the
writers
of
his
time
and
beyond
.
He
has
been
compared
to
Charles
Dickens
and
has
been
called
one
of
Dickens
'
influences
.
Critic
W.
H.
Helm
calls
one
"
the
French
Dickens
"
and
the
other
"
the
English
Balzac
"
.
Critic
Richard
Lehan
says
that
"
Balzac
was
the
bridge
between
the
comic
realism
of
Dickens
and
the
naturalism
of
Zola
.
"
Gustave
Flaubert
was
also
substantially
influenced
by
Balzac
.
Praising
his
portrayal
of
society
while
attacking
his
prose
style
,
Flaubert
once
wrote
:
While
he
disdained
the
label
of
realist
"
,
Flaubert
clearly
took
heed
of
Balzac
's
close
attention
to
detail
and
unvarnished
depictions
of
bourgeois
life
.
This
influence
shows
in
Flaubert
's
work
L
'
education
sentimentale
,
which
owes
a
debt
to
Balzac
's
Illusions
Perdues
.
What
Balzac
started
,
says
Lehan
,
"
Flaubert
helped
finish
.
he
adored
Balzac
and
studied
his
works
carefully
,
although
he
criticised
what
he
called
Balzac
's
"
vulgarity
.
However
,
Proust
wrote
later
in
life
that
the
contemporary
fashion
to
rank
Balzac
higher
than
Tolstoy
was
"
madness
.
In
1878
James
wrote
with
sadness
about
the
lack
of
contemporary
attention
paid
to
Balzac
,
and
lavished
praise
on
him
in
four
essays
(
in
1875
,
1877
,
1902
,
and
1913
)
.
In
1878
James
wrote
:
He
wrote
with
admiration
of
Balzac
's
attempt
to
portray
in
writing
a
beast
with
a
hundred
claws
.
Balzac
's
vision
of
a
society
in
which
class
,
money
and
personal
ambition
are
the
major
players
has
been
endorsed
by
critics
of
both
left-wing
and
right-wing
political
tendencies
.
Marxist
Friedrich
Engels
wrote
:
In
1970
Roland
Barthes
published
S
/
Z
,
a
detailed
analysis
of
Balzac
's
story
Sarrasine
and
a
key
work
in
structuralist
literary
criticism
.
Balzac
has
also
influenced
popular
culture
.
Many
of
his
works
have
been
made
into
popular
films
and
television
serials
.
William
Shakespeare
(
26
April
1564
(
baptised
)
–
23
April
1616
)
was
an
English
poet
,
playwright
and
actor
,
widely
regarded
as
the
greatest
writer
in
the
English
language
and
the
world
's
pre-eminent
dramatist
.
He
is
often
called
England
's
national
poet
and
the
"
Bard
of
Avon
"
.
His
extant
works
,
including
some
collaborations
,
consist
of
about
38
plays
,
154
sonnets
,
two
long
narrative
poems
,
and
a
few
other
verses
,
the
authorship
of
some
of
which
is
uncertain
.
His
plays
have
been
translated
into
every
major
living
language
and
are
performed
more
often
than
those
of
any
other
playwright
.
Shakespeare
was
born
and
brought
up
in
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon
.
Susanna
,
and
twins
Hamnet
and
Judith
.
Between
1585
and
1592
,
he
began
a
successful
career
in
London
as
an
actor
,
writer
,
and
part
-
owner
of
a
playing
company
called
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
Men
,
later
known
as
the
King
's
Men
.
He
appears
to
have
retired
to
Stratford
around
1613
at
age
49
,
where
he
died
three
years
later
.
Few
records
of
Shakespeare
's
private
life
survive
,
and
there
has
been
considerable
speculation
about
such
matters
as
his
physical
appearance
,
sexuality
,
religious
beliefs
,
and
whether
the
works
attributed
to
him
were
written
by
others
.
Shakespeare
produced
most
of
his
known
work
between
1589
and
1613
.
His
early
plays
were
mainly
comedies
and
histories
,
genres
he
raised
to
the
peak
of
sophistication
and
artistry
by
the
end
of
the
16
th
century
.
He
then
wrote
mainly
tragedies
until
about
1608
,
including
Hamlet
,
King
Lear
,
Othello
,
and
Macbeth
,
considered
some
of
the
finest
works
in
the
English
language
.
In
his
last
phase
,
he
wrote
tragicomedies
,
also
known
as
romances
,
and
collaborated
with
other
playwrights
.
Many
of
his
plays
were
published
in
editions
of
varying
quality
and
accuracy
during
his
lifetime
.
In
1623
,
John
Heminges
and
Henry
Condell
,
two
friends
and
fellow
actors
of
Shakespeare
,
published
the
First
Folio
,
a
collected
edition
of
his
dramatic
works
that
included
all
but
two
of
the
plays
now
recognised
as
Shakespeare
's
.
It
was
prefaced
with
a
poem
by
Ben
Jonson
,
in
which
Shakespeare
is
hailed
,
presciently
,
as
"
not
of
an
age
,
but
for
all
time
.
The
Romantics
,
in
particular
,
acclaimed
Shakespeare
's
genius
,
and
the
Victorians
worshipped
Shakespeare
with
a
reverence
that
George
Bernard
Shaw
called
"
bardolatry
"
.
In
the
20
th
century
,
his
work
was
repeatedly
adopted
and
rediscovered
by
new
movements
in
scholarship
and
performance
.
His
plays
remain
highly
popular
today
and
are
constantly
studied
,
performed
,
and
reinterpreted
in
diverse
cultural
and
political
contexts
throughout
the
world
.
William
Shakespeare
was
the
son
of
John
Shakespeare
,
an
alderman
and
a
successful
glover
originally
from
Snitterfield
,
and
Mary
Arden
,
the
daughter
of
an
affluent
landowning
farmer
.
He
was
born
in
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon
and
baptised
there
on
26
April
1564
.
This
date
,
which
can
be
traced
back
to
an
18
th
-
century
scholar
's
mistake
,
has
proved
appealing
to
biographers
,
since
Shakespeare
died
23
April
1616
.
He
was
the
third
child
of
eight
and
the
eldest
surviving
son
.
Although
no
attendance
records
for
the
period
survive
,
most
biographers
agree
that
Shakespeare
was
probably
educated
at
the
King
's
New
School
in
Stratford
,
a
free
school
chartered
in
1553
,
about
a
quarter
-
mile
from
his
home
.
Grammar
schools
varied
in
quality
during
the
Elizabethan
era
,
but
grammar
school
curricula
were
largely
similar
,
the
basic
Latin
text
was
standardised
by
royal
decree
,
and
the
school
would
have
provided
an
intensive
education
in
grammar
based
upon
Latin
classical
authors
.
John
Shakespeare
's
house
,
believed
to
be
Shakespeare
's
birthplace
,
in
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon
.
At
the
age
of
18
,
Shakespeare
married
the
26
-
year
-
old
Anne
Hathaway
.
The
consistory
court
of
the
Diocese
of
Worcester
issued
a
marriage
licence
on
27
November
1582
.
The
next
day
,
two
of
Hathaway
's
neighbours
posted
bonds
guaranteeing
that
no
lawful
claims
impeded
the
marriage
.
The
ceremony
may
have
been
arranged
in
some
haste
,
since
the
Worcester
chancellor
allowed
the
marriage
banns
to
be
read
once
instead
of
the
usual
three
times
,
and
six
months
after
the
marriage
Anne
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
,
Susanna
,
baptised
26
May
1583
.
Twins
,
son
Hamnet
and
daughter
Judith
,
followed
almost
two
years
later
and
were
baptised
2
February
1585
.
Hamnet
died
of
unknown
causes
at
the
age
of
11
and
was
buried
11
August
1596
.
After
the
birth
of
the
twins
,
Shakespeare
left
few
historical
traces
until
he
is
mentioned
as
part
of
the
London
theatre
scene
in
1592
.
The
exception
is
the
appearance
of
his
name
in
the
'
complaints
bill
'
of
a
law
case
before
the
Queen
's
Bench
court
at
Westminster
dated
Michaelmas
Term
1588
and
9
October
1589
.
Scholars
refer
to
the
years
between
1585
and
1592
as
Shakespeare
's
"
lost
years
"
.
Biographers
attempting
to
account
for
this
period
have
reported
many
apocryphal
stories
.
Nicholas
Rowe
,
Shakespeare
's
first
biographer
,
recounted
a
Stratford
legend
that
Shakespeare
fled
the
town
for
London
to
escape
prosecution
for
deer
poaching
in
the
estate
of
local
squire
Thomas
Lucy
.
Shakespeare
is
also
supposed
to
have
taken
his
revenge
on
Lucy
by
writing
a
scurrilous
ballad
about
him
.
Another
18
th
-
century
story
has
Shakespeare
starting
his
theatrical
career
minding
the
horses
of
theatre
patrons
in
London
.
John
Aubrey
reported
that
Shakespeare
had
been
a
country
schoolmaster
.
Some
20
th
-
century
scholars
have
suggested
that
Shakespeare
may
have
been
employed
as
a
schoolmaster
by
Alexander
Hoghton
of
Lancashire
,
a
Catholic
landowner
who
named
a
certain
"
William
Shakeshafte
"
in
his
will
.
Little
evidence
substantiates
such
stories
other
than
hearsay
collected
after
his
death
,
and
Shakeshafte
was
a
common
name
in
the
Lancashire
area
.
By
then
,
he
was
sufficiently
well
known
in
London
to
be
attacked
in
print
by
the
playwright
Robert
Greene
in
his
Groats
-
Worth
of
Wit
:
...
there
is
an
upstart
Crow
,
beautified
with
our
feathers
,
that
with
his
Tiger
's
heart
wrapped
in
a
Player
's
hide
,
supposes
he
is
as
well
able
to
bombast
out
a
blank
verse
as
the
best
of
you
:
and
being
an
absolute
Johannes
factotum
,
is
in
his
own
conceit
the
only
Shake
-
Scene
in
a
country
.
Scholars
differ
on
the
exact
meaning
of
these
words
,
but
most
agree
that
Greene
is
accusing
Shakespeare
of
reaching
above
his
rank
in
trying
to
match
university
-
educated
writers
such
as
Christopher
Marlowe
,
Thomas
Nashe
and
Greene
himself
(
the
"
university
wits
"
)
.
The
italicised
phrase
parodying
the
line
"
Oh
,
tiger
's
heart
wrapped
in
a
woman
's
hide
"
from
Shakespeare
's
Henry
VI
,
Part
3
,
along
with
the
pun
"
Shake
-
Scene
"
,
identifies
Shakespeare
as
Greene
's
target
.
Here
Johannes
Factotum
—
"
Jack
of
all
trades
"
—
means
a
second-rate
tinkerer
with
the
work
of
others
,
rather
than
the
more
common
"
universal
genius
"
.
Greene
's
attack
is
the
earliest
surviving
mention
of
Shakespeare
's
career
in
the
theatre
.
Biographers
suggest
that
his
career
may
have
begun
any
time
from
the
mid-1580s
to
just
before
Greene
's
remarks
.
From
1594
,
Shakespeare
's
plays
were
performed
by
only
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
Men
,
a
company
owned
by
a
group
of
players
,
including
Shakespeare
,
that
soon
became
the
leading
playing
company
in
London
.
After
the
death
of
Queen
Elizabeth
in
1603
,
the
company
was
awarded
a
royal
patent
by
the
new
king
,
James
I
,
and
changed
its
name
to
the
King
's
Men
.
In
1608
,
the
partnership
also
took
over
the
Blackfriars
indoor
theatre
.
In
1597
,
he
bought
the
second
-
largest
house
in
Stratford
,
New
Place
,
and
in
1605
,
he
invested
in
a
share
of
the

.
Some
of
Shakespeare
's
plays
were
published
in
quarto
editions
from
1594
.
By
1598
,
his
name
had
become
a
selling
point
and
began
to
appear
on
the
title
pages
.
Shakespeare
continued
to
act
in
his
own
and
other
plays
after
his
success
as
a
playwright
.
The
1616
edition
of
Ben
Jonson
's
Works
names
him
on
the
cast
lists
for
Every
Man
In
His
Humour
(
1598
)
and
Sejanus
His
Fall
(
1603
)
.
The
absence
of
his
name
from
the
1605
cast
list
for
Jonson
's
Volpone
is
taken
by
some
scholars
as
a
sign
that
his
acting
career
was
nearing
its
end
.
The
First
Folio
of
1623
,
however
,
lists
Shakespeare
as
one
of
"
the
Principal
Actors
in
all
these
Plays
"
,
some
of
which
were
first
staged
after
Volpone
,
although
we
cannot
know
for
certain
which
roles
he
played
.
In
1610
,
John
Davies
of
Hereford
wrote
that
"
good
Will
"
played
"
kingly
"
roles
.
In
1709
,
Rowe
passed
down
a
tradition
that
Shakespeare
played
the
ghost
of
Hamlet
's
father
.
Later
traditions
maintain
that
he
also
played
Adam
in
As
You
Like
It
and
the
Chorus
in
Henry
V
,
though
scholars
doubt
the
sources
of
the
information
.
Shakespeare
divided
his
time
between
London
and
Stratford
during
his
career
.
He
moved
across
the
river
to
Southwark
by
1599
,
the
year
his
company
constructed
the
Globe
Theatre
there
.
Rowe
was
the
first
biographer
to
record
the
tradition
,
repeated
by
Johnson
,
that
Shakespeare
retired
to
Stratford
'
some
years
before
his
death
'
.
He
was
still
working
as
an
actor
in
London
in
1608
;
in
an
answer
to
the
sharers
'
petition
in
1635
Cuthbert
Burbage
stated
that
after
purchasing
the
lease
of
the
Blackfriars
Theatre
in
1608
from
Henry
Evans
,
the
King
's
Men
'
placed
men
players
'
there
,
'
which
were
Heminges
,
Condell
,
Shakespeare
,
etc.
'
.
In
a
document
dated
7
June
1609
in
a
lawsuit
he
brought
in
Stratford
against
John
Addenbrooke
,
Shakespeare
is
described
as
'
generosus
nuper
in
curia
domini
Jacobi
'
(
'
gentleman
,
recently
at
the
Court
of
King
James
'
)
.
However
it
is
perhaps
relevant
that
the
bubonic
plague
raged
in
London
throughout
1609
.
The
London
public
playhouses
were
repeatedly
closed
during
extended
outbreaks
of
the
plague
(
a
total
of
over
60
months
closure
between
May
1603
and
February
1610
)
,
which
meant
there
was
often
no
acting
work
.
Retirement
from
all
work
was
uncommon
at
that
time
.
Shakespeare
continued
to
visit
London
during
the
years
1611
–
1614
.
In
March
1613
he
bought
a
gatehouse
in
the
former
Blackfriars
priory
;
and
from
November
1614
he
was
in
London
for
several
weeks
with
his
son-in-law
,
John
Hall
.
After
1610
,
Shakespeare
wrote
fewer
plays
,
and
none
are
attributed
to
him
after
1613
.
Shakespeare
died
on
23
April
1616
and
was
survived
by
his
wife
and
two
daughters
.
Susanna
had
married
a
physician
,
John
Hall
,
in
1607
,
and
Judith
had
married
Thomas
Quiney
,
a
vintner
,
two
months
before
Shakespeare
's
death
.
Shakespeare
signed
his
last
will
and
testament
on
25
March
1616
;
the
following
day
his
new
son-in-law
,
Thomas
Quiney
was
found
guilty
of
fathering
an
illegitimate
son
by
Margaret
Wheeler
,
who
had
died
during
childbirth
.
Thomas
was
ordered
by
the
church
court
to
do
public
penance
which
would
have
caused
much
shame
and
embarrassment
for
the
Shakespeare
family
.
In
his
will
,
Shakespeare
left
the
bulk
of
his
large
estate
to
his
elder
daughter
Susanna
.
The
terms
instructed
that
she
pass
it
down
intact
to
"
the
first
son
of
her
body
"
.
The
Quineys
had
three
children
,
all
of
whom
died
without
marrying
.
The
Halls
had
one
child
,
Elizabeth
,
who
married
twice
but
died
without
children
in
1670
,
ending
Shakespeare
's
direct
line
.
Shakespeare
's
will
scarcely
mentions
his
wife
,
Anne
,
who
was
probably
entitled
to
one
third
of
his
estate
automatically
.
He
did
make
a
point
,
however
,
of
leaving
her
"
my
second
best
bed
"
,
a
bequest
that
has
led
to
much
speculation
.
Some
scholars
see
the
bequest
as
an
insult
to
Anne
,
whereas
others
believe
that
the
second-best
bed
would
have
been
the
matrimonial
bed
and
therefore
rich
in
significance
.
Sometime
before
1623
,
a
funerary
monument
was
erected
in
his
memory
on
the
north
wall
,
with
a
half
-
effigy
of
him
in
the
act
of
writing
.
Its
plaque
compares
him
to
Nestor
,
Socrates
,
and
Virgil
.
In
1623
,
in
conjunction
with
the
publication
of
the
First
Folio
,
the
Droeshout
engraving
was
published
.
Shakespeare
has
been
commemorated
in
many
statues
and
memorials
around
the
world
,
including
funeral
monuments
in
Southwark
Cathedral
and
Poets
'
Corner
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
Most
playwrights
of
the
period
typically
collaborated
with
others
at
some
point
,
and
critics
agree
that
Shakespeare
did
the
same
,
mostly
early
and
late
in
his
career
.
Some
attributions
,
such
as
Titus
Andronicus
and
the
early
history
plays
,
remain
controversial
,
while
The
Two
Noble
Kinsmen
and
the
lost
Cardenio
have
well
-
attested
contemporary
documentation
.
Textual
evidence
also
supports
the
view
that
several
of
the
plays
were
revised
by
other
writers
after
their
original
composition
.
The
first
recorded
works
of
Shakespeare
are
Richard
III
and
the
three
parts
of
Henry
VI
,
written
in
the
early
1590
s
during
a
vogue
for
historical
drama
.
Shakespeare
's
plays
are
difficult
to
date
,
however
,
and
studies
of
the
texts
suggest
that
Titus
Andronicus
,
The
Comedy
of
Errors
,
The
Taming
of
the
Shrew
and
The
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
may
also
belong
to
Shakespeare
's
earliest
period
.
His
first
histories
,
which
draw
heavily
on
the
1587
edition
of
Raphael
Holinshed
's
Chronicles
of
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
,
dramatise
the
destructive
results
of
weak
or
corrupt
rule
and
have
been
interpreted
as
a
justification
for
the
origins
of
the
Tudor
dynasty
.
The
early
plays
were
influenced
by
the
works
of
other
Elizabethan
dramatists
,
especially
Thomas
Kyd
and
Christopher
Marlowe
,
by
the
traditions
of
medieval
drama
,
and
by
the
plays
of
Seneca
.
The
Comedy
of
Errors
was
also
based
on
classical
models
,
but
no
source
for
The
Taming
of
the
Shrew
has
been
found
,
though
it
is
related
to
a
separate
play
of
the
same
name
and
may
have
derived
from
a
folk
story
.
Like
The
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
,
in
which
two
friends
appear
to
approve
of
rape
,
the
Shrew
's
story
of
the
taming
of
a
woman
's
independent
spirit
by
a
man
sometimes
troubles
modern
critics
and
directors
.
Shakespeare
's
early
classical
and
Italianate
comedies
,
containing
tight
double
plots
and
precise
comic
sequences
,
give
way
in
the
Mid-1590s
to
the
romantic
atmosphere
of
his
greatest
comedies
.
A
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
is
a
witty
mixture
of
romance
,
fairy
magic
,
and
comic
lowlife
scenes
.
Shakespeare
's
next
comedy
,
the
equally
romantic
Merchant
of
Venice
,
contains
a
portrayal
of
the
vengeful
Jewish
moneylender
Shylock
,
which
reflects
Elizabethan
views
but
may
appear
derogatory
to
modern
audiences
.
The
wit
and
wordplay
of
Much
Ado
About
Nothing
,
the
charming
rural
setting
of
As
You
Like
It
,
and
the
lively
merrymaking
of
Twelfth
Night
complete
Shakespeare
's
sequence
of
great
comedies
.
This
period
begins
and
ends
with
two
tragedies
:
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
the
famous
romantic
tragedy
of
sexually
charged
adolescence
,
love
,
and
death
;
and
Julius
Caesar
—
based
on
Sir
Thomas
North
's
1579
translation
of
Plutarch
's
Parallel
Lives
—
which
introduced
a
new
kind
of
drama
.
According
to
Shakespearean
scholar
James
Shapiro
,
in
Julius
Caesar
"
the
various
strands
of
politics
,
character
,
inwardness
,
contemporary
events
,
even
Shakespeare
's
own
reflections
on
the
act
of
writing
,
began
to
infuse
each
other
"
.
In
the
early
17
th
century
,
Shakespeare
wrote
the
so-called
"
problem
plays
"
Measure
for
Measure
,
Troilus
and
Cressida
,
and
All
's
Well
That
Ends
Well
and
a
number
of
his
best
known
tragedies
.
Many
critics
believe
that
Shakespeare
's
greatest
tragedies
represent
the
peak
of
his
art
.
The
titular
hero
of
one
of
Shakespeare
's
most
famous
tragedies
,
Hamlet
,
has
probably
been
discussed
more
than
any
other
Shakespearean
character
,
especially
for
his
famous
soliloquy
which
begins
"
To
be
or
not
to
be
;
Unlike
the
introverted
Hamlet
,
whose
fatal
flaw
is
hesitation
,
the
heroes
of
the
tragedies
that
followed
,
Othello
and
King
Lear
,
are
undone
by
hasty
errors
of
judgement
.
The
plots
of
Shakespeare
's
tragedies
often
hinge
on
such
fatal
errors
or
flaws
,
which
overturn
order
and
destroy
the
hero
and
those
he
loves
.
In
Othello
,
the
villain
Iago
stokes
Othello
's
sexual
jealousy
to
the
point
where
he
murders
the
innocent
wife
who
loves
him
.
In
King
Lear
,
the
old
king
commits
the
tragic
error
of
giving
up
his
powers
,
initiating
the
events
which
lead
to
the
torture
and
blinding
of
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
and
the
murder
of
Lear
's
youngest
daughter
Cordelia
.
According
to
the
critic
Frank
Kermode
,
"
the
play
-
offers
neither
its
good
characters
nor
its
audience
any
relief
from
its
cruelty
"
.
In
Macbeth
,
the
shortest
and
most
compressed
of
Shakespeare
's
tragedies
,
uncontrollable
ambition
incites
Macbeth
and
his
wife
,
Lady
Macbeth
,
to
murder
the
rightful
king
and
usurp
the
throne
,
until
their
own
guilt
destroys
them
in
turn
.
In
this
play
,
Shakespeare
adds
a
supernatural
element
to
the
tragic
structure
.
His
last
major
tragedies
,
Antony
and
Cleopatra
and
Coriolanus
,
contain
some
of
Shakespeare
's
finest
poetry
and
were
considered
his
most
successful
tragedies
by
the
poet
and
critic
T.
S.
Eliot
.
In
his
final
period
,
Shakespeare
turned
to
romance
or
tragicomedy
and
completed
three
more
major
plays
:
Cymbeline
,
The
Winter
's
Tale
and
The
Tempest
,
as
well
as
the
collaboration
,
Pericles
,
Prince
of
Tyre
.
Less
bleak
than
the
tragedies
,
these
four
plays
are
graver
in
tone
than
the
comedies
of
the
1590
s
,
but
they
end
with
reconciliation
and
the
forgiveness
of
potentially
tragic
errors
.
Some
commentators
have
seen
this
change
in
mood
as
evidence
of
a
more
serene
view
of
life
on
Shakespeare
's
part
,
but
it
may
merely
reflect
the
theatrical
fashion
of
the
day
.
It
is
not
clear
for
which
companies
Shakespeare
wrote
his
early
plays
.
The
title
page
of
the
1594
edition
of
Titus
Andronicus
reveals
that
the
play
had
been
acted
by
three
different
troupes
.
After
the
plagues
of
1592
–
3
,
Shakespeare
's
plays
were
performed
by
his
own
company
at
The
Theatre
and
the
Curtain
in
Shoreditch
,
north
of
the
Thames
.
Londoners
flocked
there
to
see
the
first
part
of
Henry
IV
,
Leonard
Digges
recording
,
"
Let
but
Falstaff
come
,
Hal
,
Poins
,
the
rest
...
and
you
scarce
shall
have
a
room
"
.
When
the
company
found
themselves
in
dispute
with
their
landlord
,
they
pulled
The
Theatre
down
and
used
the
timbers
to
construct
the
Globe
Theatre
,
the
first
playhouse
built
by
actors
for
actors
,
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Thames
at
Southwark
.
The
Globe
opened
in
autumn
1599
,
with
Julius
Caesar
one
of
the
first
plays
staged
.
Most
of
Shakespeare
's
greatest
post-1599
plays
were
written
for
the
Globe
,
including
Hamlet
,
Othello
and
King
Lear
.
After
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
Men
were
renamed
the
King
's
Men
in
1603
,
they
entered
a
special
relationship
with
the
new
King
James
.
Although
the
performance
records
are
patchy
,
the
King
's
Men
performed
seven
of
Shakespeare
's
plays
at
court
between
1
November
1604
and
31
October
1605
,
including
two
performances
of
The
Merchant
of
Venice
.
After
1608
,
they
performed
at
the
indoor
Blackfriars
Theatre
during
the
winter
and
the
Globe
during
the
summer
.
The
indoor
setting
,
combined
with
the
Jacobean
fashion
for
lavishly
staged
masques
,
allowed
Shakespeare
to
introduce
more
elaborate
stage
devices
.
The
actors
in
Shakespeare
's
company
included
the
famous
Richard
Burbage
,
William
Kempe
,
Henry
Condell
and
John
Heminges
.
Burbage
played
the
leading
role
in
the
first
performances
of
many
of
Shakespeare
's
plays
,
including
Richard
III
,
Hamlet
,
Othello
,
and
King
Lear
.
The
popular
comic
actor
Will
Kempe
played
the
servant
Peter
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
and
Dogberry
in
Much
Ado
About
Nothing
,
among
other
characters
.
He
was
replaced
around
the
turn
of
the
16
th
century
by
Robert
Armin
,
who
played
roles
such
as
Touchstone
in
As
You
Like
It
and
the
fool
in
King
Lear
.
On
29
June
,
however
,
a
cannon
set
fire
to
the
thatch
of
the
Globe
and
burned
the
theatre
to
the
ground
,
an
event
which
pinpoints
the
date
of
a
Shakespeare
play
with
rare
precision
.
In
1623
,
John
Heminges
and
Henry
Condell
,
two
of
Shakespeare
's
friends
from
the
King
's
Men
,
published
the
First
Folio
,
a
collected
edition
of
Shakespeare
's
plays
.
Many
of
the
plays
had
already
appeared
in
quarto
versions
—
flimsy
books
made
from
sheets
of
paper
folded
twice
to
make
four
leaves
.
No
evidence
suggests
that
Shakespeare
approved
these
editions
,
which
the
First
Folio
describes
as
"
stol'n
and
surreptitious
copies
"
.
Alfred
Pollard
termed
some
of
them
"
bad
quartos
"
because
of
their
adapted
,
paraphrased
or
garbled
texts
,
which
may
in
places
have
been
reconstructed
from
memory
.
Where
several
versions
of
a
play
survive
,
each
differs
from
the
other
.
The
differences
may
stem
from
copying
or
printing
errors
,
from
notes
by
actors
or
audience
members
,
or
from
Shakespeare
's
own
papers
.
In
some
cases
,
for
example
Hamlet
,
Troilus
and
Cressida
and
Othello
,
Shakespeare
could
have
revised
the
texts
between
the
quarto
and
folio
editions
.
In
the
case
of
King
Lear
,
however
,
while
most
modern
editions
do
conflate
them
,
the
1623
folio
version
is
so
different
from
the
1608
quarto
,
that
the
Oxford
Shakespeare
prints
them
both
,
arguing
that
they
cannot
be
conflated
without
confusion
.
In
1593
and
1594
,
when
the
theatres
were
closed
because
of
plague
,
Shakespeare
published
two
narrative
poems
on
erotic
themes
,
Venus
and
Adonis
and
The
Rape
of
Lucrece
.
In
Venus
and
Adonis
,
an
innocent
Adonis
rejects
the
sexual
advances
of
Venus
;
while
in
The
Rape
of
Lucrece
,
the
virtuous
wife
Lucrece
is
raped
by
the
lustful
Tarquin
.
Influenced
by
Ovid
's
Metamorphoses
,
the
poems
show
the
guilt
and
moral
confusion
that
result
from
uncontrolled
lust
.
Both
proved
popular
and
were
often
reprinted
during
Shakespeare
's
lifetime
.
A
third
narrative
poem
,
A
Lover
's
Complaint
,
in
which
a
young
woman
laments
her
seduction
by
a
persuasive
suitor
,
was
printed
in
the
first
edition
of
the
Sonnets
in
1609
.
Most
scholars
now
accept
that
Shakespeare
wrote
A
Lover
's
Complaint
.
Critics
consider
that
its
fine
qualities
are
marred
by
leaden
effects
.
The
Phoenix
and
the
Turtle
,
printed
in
Robert
Chester
's
1601
Love
's
Martyr
,
mourns
the
deaths
of
the
legendary
phoenix
and
his
lover
,
the
faithful
turtle
dove
.
In
1599
,
two
early
drafts
of
sonnets
138
and
144
appeared
in
The
Passionate
Pilgrim
,
published
under
Shakespeare
's
name
but
without
his
permission
.
Published
in
1609
,
the
Sonnets
were
the
last
of
Shakespeare
's
non
-
dramatic
works
to
be
printed
.
Scholars
are
not
certain
when
each
of
the
154
sonnets
was
composed
,
but
evidence
suggests
that
Shakespeare
wrote
sonnets
throughout
his
career
for
a
private
readership
.
Even
before
the
two
unauthorised
sonnets
appeared
in
The
Passionate
Pilgrim
in
1599
,
Francis
Meres
had
referred
in
1598
to
Shakespeare
's
"
sugred
Sonnets
among
his
private
friends
"
.
Few
analysts
believe
that
the
published
collection
follows
Shakespeare
's
intended
sequence
.
He
seems
to
have
planned
two
contrasting
series
:
one
about
uncontrollable
lust
for
a
married
woman
of
dark
complexion
(
the
"
dark
lady
"
)
,
and
one
about
conflicted
love
for
a
fair
young
man
(
the
"
fair
youth
"
)
.
It
remains
unclear
if
these
figures
represent
real
individuals
,
or
if
the
authorial
"
I
"
who
addresses
them
represents
Shakespeare
himself
,
though
Wordsworth
believed
that
with
the
sonnets
"
Shakespeare
unlocked
his
heart
"
.
The
1609
edition
was
dedicated
to
a
"
Mr.
W.H.
"
,
credited
as
"
the
only
begetter
"
of
the
poems
.
Critics
praise
the
Sonnets
as
a
profound
meditation
on
the
nature
of
love
,
sexual
passion
,
procreation
,
death
,
and
time
.
Shakespeare
's
first
plays
were
written
in
the
conventional
style
of
the
day
.
He
wrote
them
in
a
stylised
language
that
does
not
always
spring
naturally
from
the
needs
of
the
characters
or
the
drama
.
The
poetry
depends
on
extended
,
sometimes
elaborate
metaphors
and
conceits
,
and
the
language
is
often
rhetorical
—
written
for
actors
to
declaim
rather
than
speak
.
The
grand
speeches
in
Titus
Andronicus
,
in
the
view
of
some
critics
,
often
hold
up
the
action
,
for
example
;
and
the
verse
in
The
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
has
been
described
as
stilted
.
Soon
,
however
,
Shakespeare
began
to
adapt
the
traditional
styles
to
his
own
purposes
.
The
opening
soliloquy
of
Richard
III
has
its
roots
in
the
self
-
declaration
of
Vice
in
medieval
drama
.
At
the
same
time
,
Richard
's
vivid
self
-
awareness
looks
forward
to
the
soliloquies
of
Shakespeare
's
mature
plays
.
No
single
play
marks
a
change
from
the
traditional
to
the
freer
style
.
Shakespeare
combined
the
two
throughout
his
career
,
with
Romeo
and
Juliet
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
mixing
of
the
styles
.
By
the
time
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
Richard
II
,
and
A
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
in
the
Mid-1590s
,
Shakespeare
had
begun
to
write
a
more
natural
poetry
.
He
increasingly
tuned
his
metaphors
and
images
to
the
needs
of
the
drama
itself
.
Shakespeare
's
standard
poetic
form
was
blank
verse
,
composed
in
iambic
pentameter
.
In
practice
,
this
meant
that
his
verse
was
usually
unrhymed
and
consisted
of
ten
syllables
to
a
line
,
spoken
with
a
stress
on
every
second
syllable
.
The
blank
verse
of
his
early
plays
is
quite
different
from
that
of
his
later
ones
.
It
is
often
beautiful
,
but
its
sentences
tend
to
start
,
pause
,
and
finish
at
the
end
of
lines
,
with
the
risk
of
monotony
.
Once
Shakespeare
mastered
traditional
blank
verse
,
he
began
to
interrupt
and
vary
its
flow
.
This
technique
releases
the
new
power
and
flexibility
of
the
poetry
in
plays
such
as
Julius
Caesar
and
Hamlet
.
Shakespeare
uses
it
,
for
example
,
to
convey
the
turmoil
in
Hamlet
's
mind
.
The
literary
critic
A.
C.
Bradley
described
this
style
as
"
more
concentrated
,
rapid
,
varied
,
and
,
in
construction
,
less
regular
,
not
seldom
twisted
or
elliptical
"
.
In
the
last
phase
of
his
career
,
Shakespeare
adopted
many
techniques
to
achieve
these
effects
.
These
included
run-on
lines
,
irregular
pauses
and
stops
,
and
extreme
variations
in
sentence
structure
and
length
.
In
Macbeth
,
for
example
,
the
language
darts
from
one
unrelated
metaphor
or
simile
to
another
.
The
listener
is
challenged
to
complete
the
sense
.
The
late
romances
,
with
their
shifts
in
time
and
surprising
turns
of
plot
,
inspired
a
last
poetic
style
in
which
long
and
short
sentences
are
set
against
one
another
,
clauses
are
piled
up
,
subject
and
object
are
reversed
,
and
words
are
omitted
,
creating
an
effect
of
spontaneity
.
Shakespeare
combined
poetic
genius
with
a
practical
sense
of
the
theatre
.
Like
all
playwrights
of
the
time
,
he
dramatised
stories
from
sources
such
as
Plutarch
and
Holinshed
.
He
reshaped
each
plot
to
create
several
centres
of
interest
and
to
show
as
many
sides
of
a
narrative
to
the
audience
as
possible
.
This
strength
of
design
ensures
that
a
Shakespeare
play
can
survive
translation
,
cutting
and
wide
interpretation
without
loss
to
its
core
drama
.
As
Shakespeare
's
mastery
grew
,
he
gave
his
characters
clearer
and
more
varied
motivations
and
distinctive
patterns
of
speech
.
He
preserved
aspects
of
his
earlier
style
in
the
later
plays
,
however
.
Shakespeare
's
work
has
made
a
lasting
impression
on
later
theatre
and
literature
.
In
particular
,
he
expanded
the
dramatic
potential
of
characterisation
,
plot
,
language
,
and
genre
.
Until
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
for
example
,
romance
had
not
been
viewed
as
a
worthy
topic
for
tragedy
.
Soliloquies
had
been
used
mainly
to
convey
information
about
characters
or
events
;
but
Shakespeare
used
them
to
explore
characters
'
minds
.
His
work
heavily
influenced
later
poetry
.
The
Romantic
poets
attempted
to
revive
Shakespearean
verse
drama
,
though
with
little
success
.
Critic
George
Steiner
described
all
English
verse
dramas
from
Coleridge
to
Tennyson
as
"
feeble
variations
on
Shakespearean
themes
.
The
American
novelist
Herman
Melville
's
soliloquies
owe
much
to
Shakespeare
;
his
Captain
Ahab
in
Moby
-
Dick
is
a
classic
tragic
hero
,
inspired
by
King
Lear
.
Scholars
have
identified
20,000
pieces
of
music
linked
to
Shakespeare
's
works
.
Shakespeare
has
also
inspired
many
painters
,
including
the
Romantics
and
the
Pre
-
Raphaelites
.
The
Swiss
Romantic
artist
Henry
Fuseli
,
a
friend
of
William
Blake
,
even
translated
Macbeth
into
German
.
The
psychoanalyst
Sigmund
Freud
drew
on
Shakespearean
psychology
,
in
particular
that
of
Hamlet
,
for
his
theories
of
human
nature
.
Samuel
Johnson
quoted
him
more
often
than
any
other
author
in
his
A
Dictionary
of
the
English
Language
,
the
first
serious
work
of
its
type
.
Expressions
such
as
"
with
bated
breath
"
(
Merchant
of
Venice
)
and
"
a
foregone
conclusion
"
(
Othello
)
have
found
their
way
into
everyday
English
speech
.
Shakespeare
was
not
revered
in
his
lifetime
,
but
he
received
a
large
amount
of
praise
.
In
1598
,
the
cleric
and
author
Francis
Meres
singled
him
out
from
a
group
of
English
writers
as
"
the
most
excellent
"
in
both
comedy
and
tragedy
.
The
authors
of
the
Parnassus
plays
at
St
John
's
College
,
Cambridge
numbered
him
with
Chaucer
,
Gower
and
Spenser
.
In
the
First
Folio
,
Ben
Jonson
called
Shakespeare
the
"
Soul
of
the
age
,
the
applause
,
delight
,
the
wonder
of
our
stage
"
,
though
he
had
remarked
elsewhere
that
"
Shakespeare
wanted
art
"
.
Between
the
Restoration
of
the
monarchy
in
1660
and
the
end
of
the
17
th
century
,
classical
ideas
were
in
vogue
.
As
a
result
,
critics
of
the
time
mostly
rated
Shakespeare
below
John
Fletcher
and
Ben
Jonson
.
Thomas
Rymer
,
for
example
,
condemned
Shakespeare
for
mixing
the
comic
with
the
tragic
.
Nevertheless
,
poet
and
critic
John
Dryden
rated
Shakespeare
highly
,
saying
of
Jonson
,
"
I
admire
him
,
but
I
love
Shakespeare
"
.
For
several
decades
,
Rymer
's
view
held
sway
;
but
during
the
18
th
century
,
critics
began
to
respond
to
Shakespeare
on
his
own
terms
and
acclaim
what
they
termed
his
natural
genius
.
A
series
of
scholarly
editions
of
his
work
,
notably
those
of
Samuel
Johnson
in
1765
and
Edmond
Malone
in
1790
,
added
to
his
growing
reputation
.
By
1800
,
he
was
firmly
enshrined
as
the
national
poet
.
Among
those
who
championed
him
were
the
writers
Voltaire
,
Goethe
,
Stendhal
and
Victor
Hugo
.
During
the
Romantic
era
,
Shakespeare
was
praised
by
the
poet
and
literary
philosopher
Samuel
Taylor
Coleridge
;
and
the
critic
August
Wilhelm
Schlegel
translated
his
plays
in
the
spirit
of
German
Romanticism
.
In
the
19
th
century
,
critical
admiration
for
Shakespeare
's
genius
often
bordered
on
adulation
.
That
King
Shakespeare
,
the
essayist
Thomas
Carlyle
wrote
in
1840
,
"
does
not
he
shine
,
in
crowned
sovereignty
,
over
us
all
,
as
the
noblest
,
gentlest
,
yet
strongest
of
rallying
signs
;
indestructible
"
.
The
Victorians
produced
his
plays
as
lavish
spectacles
on
a
grand
scale
.
The
playwright
and
critic
George
Bernard
Shaw
mocked
the
cult
of
Shakespeare
worship
as
"
bardolatry
"
.
He
claimed
that
the
new
naturalism
of
Ibsen
's
plays
had
made
Shakespeare
obsolete
.
The
modernist
revolution
in
the
arts
during
the
early
20
th
century
,
far
from
discarding
Shakespeare
,
eagerly
enlisted
his
work
in
the
service
of
the
avant-garde
.
The
Expressionists
in
Germany
and
the
Futurists
in
Moscow
mounted
productions
of
his
plays
.
Marxist
playwright
and
director
Bertolt
Brecht
devised
an
epic
theatre
under
the
influence
of
Shakespeare
.
The
poet
and
critic
T.
S.
Eliot
argued
against
Shaw
that
Shakespeare
's
"
primitiveness
"
in
fact
made
him
truly
modern
.
Eliot
,
along
with
G.
Wilson
Knight
and
the
school
of
New
Criticism
,
led
a
movement
towards
a
closer
reading
of
Shakespeare
's
imagery
.
By
the
1980
s
,
Shakespeare
studies
were
open
to
movements
such
as
structuralism
,
feminism
,
New
Historicism
,
African-American
studies
,
and
queer
studies
.
Around
230
years
after
Shakespeare
's
death
,
doubts
began
to
be
expressed
about
the
authorship
of
the
works
attributed
to
him
.
Proposed
alternative
candidates
include
Francis
Bacon
,
Christopher
Marlowe
,
and
Edward
De
Vere
,
17
th
earl
of
Oxford
.
Several
"
group
theories
"
have
also
been
proposed
.
Some
scholars
claim
that
members
of
Shakespeare
's
family
were
Catholics
,
at
a
time
when
Catholic
practice
was
against
the
law
.
Shakespeare
's
mother
,
Mary
Arden
,
certainly
came
from
a
pious
Catholic
family
.
The
strongest
evidence
might
be
a
Catholic
statement
of
faith
signed
by
John
Shakespeare
,
found
in
1757
in
the
rafters
of
his
former
house
in
Henley
Street
.
The
document
is
now
lost
,
however
,
and
scholars
differ
as
to
its
authenticity
.
In
1591
the
authorities
reported
that
John
Shakespeare
had
missed
church
"
for
fear
of
process
for
debt
"
,
a
common
Catholic
excuse
.
In
1606
the
name
of
William
's
daughter
Susanna
appears
on
a
list
of
those
who
failed
to
attend
Easter
communion
in
Stratford
.
Scholars
find
evidence
both
for
and
against
Shakespeare
's
Catholicism
in
his
plays
,
but
the
truth
may
be
impossible
to
prove
either
way
.
Few
details
of
Shakespeare
's
sexuality
are
known
.
Susanna
,
the
first
of
their
three
children
,
was
born
six
months
later
on
26
May
1583
.
Over
the
centuries
some
readers
have
posited
that
Shakespeare
's
sonnets
are
autobiographical
,
and
point
to
them
as
evidence
of
his
love
for
a
young
man
.
Others
read
the
same
passages
as
the
expression
of
intense
friendship
rather
than
sexual
love
.
The
26
so-called
"
Dark
Lady
"
sonnets
,
addressed
to
a
married
woman
,
are
taken
as
evidence
of
heterosexual
liaisons
.
No
written
contemporary
description
of
Shakespeare
's
physical
appearance
survives
,
and
no
evidence
suggests
that
he
ever
commissioned
a
portrait
,
so
the
Droeshout
engraving
,
which
Ben
Jonson
approved
of
as
a
good
likeness
,
and
his
Stratford
monument
provide
the
best
evidence
of
his
appearance
.
From
the
18
th
century
,
the
desire
for
authentic
Shakespeare
portraits
fuelled
claims
that
various
surviving
pictures
depicted
Shakespeare
.
That
demand
also
led
to
the
production
of
several
fake
portraits
,
as
well
as
mis
-
attributions
,
repaintings
and
relabelling
of
portraits
of
other
people
.
Shakespeare
's
works
include
the
36
plays
printed
in
the
First
Folio
of
1623
,
listed
below
according
to
their
Folio
classification
as
comedies
,
histories
and
tragedies
.
Two
plays
not
included
in
the
First
Folio
,
The
Two
Noble
Kinsmen
and
Pericles
,
Prince
of
Tyre
,
are
now
accepted
as
part
of
the
canon
,
with
scholars
agreed
that
Shakespeare
made
a
major
contribution
to
their
composition
.
No
Shakespearean
poems
were
included
in
the
First
Folio
.
